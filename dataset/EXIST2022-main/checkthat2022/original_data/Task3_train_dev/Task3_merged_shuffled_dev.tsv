81a67c96	"Former state House Majority Leader Adam Hasner, now running in a crowded Republican primary to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson in 2012, came out swinging against the federal health-care law backed by President Barack Obama. On Wednesday morning, noting that oral arguments would begin in the constitutional challenge launched by Florida and other states against the law, Hasner insisted the health-care law was undermining economic recovery. ""Today, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeal in Atlanta will hear oral arguments from 26 states seeking to overturn President Obama and Senator Bill Nelson's unconstitutional health-care takeover. Led by Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, the states have already won significant legal victories against this overreach by the federal government, said Hasner. ""Attorney General Bondi is right to focus on the need for states to protect and defend the individual liberties of their citizens, as well as preserve the constitutional principle of limited government. But there is an important economic component to defeating Obamacare, as well. ""Implementation of Obamacare has played a major role in prolonging our country's economic challenges. Earlier this year, the head of the Congressional Budget Office testified before Congress that implementation of Obamacare would cost 800,000 jobs. Here in Florida, nearly 1 million Floridians are already out of work and the myriad regulations, taxes, and rules contained in Obamacare have only caused more worry and hesitation among the small-business men and women and job creators I've met with during the past three months, added Hasner. ""Individual liberty and limited government are paramount toward the defeat of Obamacare, but we should also never forget the incredible toll this massive overreach of government will take on our economic freedoms, as well. Getting Florida and America back to work requires expanding economic freedoms, and getting Washington regulations out of the way of job creators. There's no better place to start than by defeating Obamacare in the courts and repealing it in Congress."""	- The Washington Post	partially false
6e5ec6fb	Editor’s note: Subsequent to this article, VTDigger published a fact-check of the Col. Matthew Birmingham’s claim that police face a risk of death due to exposure to small amounts of opioids. A Vermont state trooper had to be revived by multiple doses of Narcan after he apprehended a man in a routine traffic stop. Get all of VTDigger's daily news. You'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox. Acting Sgt. Brett Flansburg stopped a vehicle for a traffic violation in Leicester late Friday night and saw the driver, Taylor Woodward, 25, swallow a baggie that was later identified as a baggie of cocaine, police said. In a search of the vehicle, Flansburg collected a small quantity of heroin in a baggie. Woodward was then taken into custody by other troopers on the scene for processing on suspicion of possessing heroin, police said. Flansburg began to feel ill as he drove to the New Haven Barracks. When he arrived, he collapsed in the parking lot and was found unresponsive, police said. He was unresponsive when he was found by fellow troopers who immediately administered Narcan. In all, Flansburg received three doses of the opiate antidote in a row. He was rushed to UVM Medical Center in Burlington where he was treated and released, police said. Woodward was brought separately to UVMMC and did not need medical care. He will be arraigned May 6 in Vermont Superior Court, Criminal Division, in Middlebury. He faces a misdemeanor charge of heroin possession. The drug Flansburg was exposed to is being tested and the incident is under investigation. Col. Matthew Birmingham, director of the Vermont State Police, said in a press release that “being a state trooper is a dangerous and demanding job for all the reasons you’d expect: apprehending criminals, encountering volatile individuals, rushing toward emergencies rather than away. “Now there is a new threat that we’re seeing up close: the risk of exposure to powerful drugs that can kill in even tiny amounts,” Birmingham said. “This is so troubling and disconcerting, and it places members of law enforcement at unnecessary risk of possibly losing their lives.” “Were it not for the immediate availability of Narcan and the quick actions of his fellow troopers and medical personnel, we might be speaking today about the death of a trooper in the line of duty,” the colonel said. “I’m angry at how close we came, and relieved that the situation was no worse than it was.” Stay on top of all of Vermont's criminal justice news.

4a1a9b9f	Urgent action to boost the number of children and young people receiving life-saving vaccinations will be set out by the Prime Minister today. Boris Johnson will visit a hospital in the South West and lay out a number of measures designed to improve vaccination rates, including for measles, mumps and rubella MMR. While confidence in the UK’s world-leading vaccination programme remains high – with uptake exceeding 90% for most childhood immunisations – there has been a small but steady decline in coverage in recent years. It means that the UK has lost its ‘measles-free’ status with the World Health Organisation WHO – three years after the virus was eliminated in the country. The WHO have stated that in the first six months of 2019 reported measles cases globally are almost three times as many as the same time last year. Measles is now endemic in countries including France, Germany and Italy. The PM has now called for health leaders to renew their efforts to meet 95% for both doses of MMR. Currently just 87% of children are getting their second dose of the jab, which has likely contributed to the spread of measles. Action to achieve this includes: NHS England writing to GPs urging them to promote ‘catch up’ vaccination programmes for MMR for 10-11 year olds, as well as all those 5-25 year olds who have not had two doses of the jab; Strengthening the role of local immunisation coordinators – healthcare professionals that promote vaccines particularly with hard-to-reach families. This includes supporting areas with low uptake and tailoring specific local interventions to under-vaccinated communities; Addressing parents’ concerns about vaccines by updating the advice on NHS.uk specifically to address misleading information about the dangers of vaccines, by giving people NHS-approved, evidence-based and trusted advice on vaccines including through a new website; Calling a summit of social media companies to discuss how they can play their part in promoting accurate information about vaccination; and The Department for Health and Social Care – working with Public Health England and NHS England – delivering a comprehensive strategy to address the issue in the Autumn. Ahead of the hospital visit Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: After a period of progress where we were once able to declare Britain measles free, we’ve now seen hundreds of cases of measles in the UK this year. One case of this horrible disease is too many, and I am determined to step up our efforts to tackle its spread. This is a global challenge and there’s a number of reasons why people don’t get themselves or their children the vaccines they need, but we need decisive action across our health service and society to make sure communities are properly immunised. From reassuring parents about the safety of vaccines, to making sure people are attending follow-up appointments, we can and must do more to halt the spread of infectious, treatable diseases in modern-day Britain. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: It’s easy to forget how devastating measles can be precisely because vaccines are so effective at preventing it in the first place. With this strategy, the whole health system will come together to renew focus on vaccinations – especially for our children – and this time we will eliminate measles for good. The Prime Minister’s visit to the South West is part of a series of visits to hospitals he is taking. He will meet doctors and nurses, hearing directly from them about what support they think the NHS needs so it can continue to be the best healthcare service in the world. Measles elimination status means that the virus is no longer circulating permanently in a country. The UK achieved measles-free status in 2016 after three years of limited spread due to high vaccination rates, but measles has since been spreading slowly in the UK for over 12 months. In the first quarter of 2019, there were 231 confirmed cases of measles in the UK. Many of these were acquired abroad with some onward spread in under-vaccinated communities. The Department for Health’s strategy to be published in the Autumn is also expected to: Ask the NHS to use technology to identify who may have missed a vaccination and make booking appointments easier, such as improved call/recall systems for those accessing immunisations, and more consistent use of these systems across UK healthcare to remind people of their vaccine appointments. As part of the GP contract review, examine wider questions of improving GP capacity to allow additional immunisation appointments – while also asking NHS England to consider other settings outside of a GP for vaccinations. Develop a major campaign with NHS England and Improvement, Public Health England and GP practices to support the importance of key vaccinations in protecting against potentially dangerous diseases. Work with DFE to explore more ways in which students can be informed about their health and wellbeing including the value of vaccinations – plus enabling them to critically assess misinformation spread online about certain vaccines. This comes as part of a wider government drive on Prevention, following the publication of the Prevention Green Paper last month. Head of Immunisation at Public Health England Dr Mary Ramsay said: Losing our ‘measles-free’ status is a stark reminder of how important it is that every eligible person gets vaccinated. Elimination can only be sustained by maintaining and improving coverage of the MMR vaccine. Measles is one of the most infectious diseases known to man – only one person travelling back to an area with lower vaccination rates can lead to an outbreak. Anyone who has not received two doses of MMR vaccine is always at risk.	Who are the arsonists setting rural fires in Washington State?	false
6d16fa40	By Ken Allen AFSCME Council 75 represents the workers in the vast majority of the state corrections facilities in Oregon. Our members work hard to protect the public, while working with inmates incarcerated in 13 prisons throughout the state. While the majority of our members are corrections officers, we also represent counselors, dentists, food service workers, nurses, maintenance and clerical workers, among others. These jobs are tough, stressful and sometimes dangerous. The Oregon Legislature and governor are currently considering how to close a $340 million budget hole because tax revenues are less than expected when forecast last May. Part of a budget deal announced on the first day of this year's legislative session would close the Santiam Correctional Institution southeast of Salem. The estimated savings after closure in June would be $1.6 million. The governor and the Legislature should reconsider this plan. The closure plan and the numbers don't add up. The closure is a knee-jerk reaction to a real budget problem. The Santiam Correctional Institution holds 440 inmates. It is a minimum-security facility. Typically, minimum-security facilities are the cheapest to operate, followed by medium-security, with maximum-security facilities at the highest cost per inmate. The legislative plan is to release none of the 440 inmates, but ship them to other prisons throughout Oregon. Under the current plan, 50 percent of these minimum-security inmates would be then imprisoned in a higher-cost medium-security facility. All the 440 inmates would be pushed into an already overcrowded prison system. We have 395 inmates pushed into triple-bunked cells intended for two inmates and bunked in classrooms and areas supposed to be designated for inmate labor. We have units that were designated for 80 inmates with 120 inmates, with only one corrections officer supervising these inmates. We have units with blind spots, including no sightline to the bathroom, with only one corrections officer supervising 80 to 100 inmates. The plan to send 440 more inmates into an overcrowded system would create dangerous and hazardous work for our members and the inmates. Prison overcrowding leads to assaults on staff and other inmates and to lawsuits. The Department of Corrections believes it would have to reopen the facility 12 to 18 months later because of inmate population growth. The leadership of this union is opposed to the closure of the Santiam facility. Department leadership has asked legislators to let them find the $1.6 million of cuts in the budget of the whole department. Legislators should do their jobs to monitor budget needs, but none of them has ever even run a prison. Let the managers and workers at the Department of Corrections put together a plan to save $1.6 million. Don't close the Santiam Correctional Institution.

31d75b45	Bernie Sanders, an independent, represents Vermont in the Senate and is a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president. Americans owe many of our freedoms to those who put their lives on the line for racial equality: people like Fannie Lou Hamer, Medgar Evers and Daisy Bates. But a racial wealth gap of 10 to 1 exists between white and black Americans, and that gap, along with the effects of racism, fuels disparities in areas ranging from health care to housing and from college debt to criminal sentencing. Many black Americans are disillusioned about politicians who champion the organizing power of black women when it’s time to turn out the vote but neglect their needs between election cycles. They are tired of politicians offering meaningful yet inadequate reforms — kicking the can of progress down the road instead of using their political capital to fight for reforms that current generations desperately need. They’re tired of coming in second to groups that hold the power of the purse or the might of demographic majority. And they’ve said enough is enough: The status quo is simply insufficient. I couldn’t agree more. Structural problems require structural solutions, and promises of mere “access” have never guaranteed black Americans equality in this country. Sixty-five years after Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, education has remained separate and unequal. “Access” to health care is an empty promise when you can’t afford high premiums, co-pays or deductibles. And an “opportunity” for an equal education is an opportunity in name only when you can’t afford to live in a good school district or to pay college tuition. Jobs, health care, criminal justice and education are linked, and progress will not be made unless we address the economic systems that oppress Americans at their root. As Princeton’s Keeanga Yamahtta-Taylor recently argued, “There is no race without class in this country.” Yet most politicians won’t acknowledge the role that our economic system plays in maintaining racial inequality. Example after example shows that corporate exploitation disproportionately affects black people. Black Americans lost 40 percent of their wealth in the 2009 housing crisis, and were the target of predatory lenders. Black Americans are more likely than white Americans to be paid a minimum wage salary, and black Americans stand to benefit disproportionately from a $15 an hour federal minimum wage. Walmart is the largest private employer of African Americans in the country — 42 percent of its associates are black. And it pays its employees below a living wage — even while the Walton family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of Americans. Former vice president Joe Biden recently said, “I don’t think 500 billionaires are the reason why we’re in trouble.” I respectfully disagree. It is my view that any presidential candidate who claims to believe that black lives matter has to take on the institutions that have continually exploited black lives. The racial wealth gap lingers in part because the politicians who could close it are funded by the very corporate donors who continue to benefit from it. Gross inequality persists largely unchallenged despite the United States’ massive wealth because myths about racial inferiority and the “undeserving poor” justify the worst effects of unfettered capitalism. As long as corporations can rely on the indifference to black lives as a cover for their exploitation, they will continue to do so. Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, argues powerfully that corporations play a central role in “sustaining, or worsening, the forces of racism in America,” whether by advancing racist stereotypes, sponsoring voter suppression or exploiting low-wage workers who are disproportionately black and brown. And he’s right. The unfortunate truth is that politicians who take checks from millionaires and billionaires owe their corporate constituents first, and everyday Americans last. The black-white wealth gap could be closed by targeting the extreme wealth at the very top. Instead, politicians beholden to the one percent ask the black middle class and the white middle class to fight over scraps. I’m proud that our campaign is fueled by more small-dollar donations than any other — more of our donors work at Walmart than any other company. Our willingness to take on powerful special interests as we fight for universal health care and a living wage — instead of the private prison industry and tax breaks for the rich — is a direct consequence of my campaign’s financial independence. The straightest path to racial equality is through the one percent. A system where we don’t address both racial and economic disparity is a system in which some people, especially African Americans, are going to be left behind. We should not be swayed by those who would try to force us to choose one over the other.

073f3552	EXCLUSIVE: Third of cases won by terrorists, murderers and lags EXCLUSIVE by TOM NEWTON DUNN, Political Editor 17th August 2015, 11:01 pm Updated: 5th April 2016, 8:00 pm A THIRD of those who have won against Britain at the European Court of Human Rights are terrorists, prisoners or criminals, figures show. Among claimants the court found in favour of since 1975 are murderers, terrorists in Iraq and IRA gunmen. Its recent controversial judgments include refusing a Home Office deportation order for Islamic hate preacher Abu Qatada and insisting prisoners must have the vote. The figures showing that the 297 victories against the UK included 94 prisoners, terrorists or criminals are revealed in a glossy dossier produced by ECHR-supporting pressure group RightsInfo. It is a response to criticisms of the Strasbourg court by Tory ministers and The Sun. Commons Justice Committee chairman Bob Neill MP said: “This is well beyond what any sensible person would say is real human rights. “It’s mission creep, law made by judges who are not judges and many from countries with questionable human rights and very little judicial experience. “Political pressure groups take advantage of that naivety, which costs the British taxpayer considerable sums.” It costs £286million a year to fund the euro judges’ governing body, the Council of Europe and £23million of that comes from British taxes. Since 1959, the UK has won only 41 per cent of 513 ECHR cases. RightsInfo’s Adam Wagner said: “People accused of crimes or convicted of offences have human rights too, so it isn’t surprising that they have featured in 40 years of cases.” The fanatic Hate preacher Abu Qatada Reuters 3 ABU Qatada won the right to stay in Britain rather than be deported to his homeland Jordan after ECHR judges said there was a risk evidence obtained by torture could be used against him in a terror trial. In that case Qatada, described as Osama Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, would not get a fair trial. The Strasbourg court’s 2012 decision overturned a ruling by UK law lords. Qatada had been convicted in Jordan in 1999 in his absence of a conspiracy to carry out bombings. He was finally returned in 2013 after Jordan agreed torture evidence would not be used. PRISONER John Hirst first won the right for convicted criminals to vote following a European court ruling in 2005. Hirst had previously lost his claim at the High Court in 2001 but took the case to Europe and won. No UK Government has legislated on the issue despite four rulings in Hirst’s favour by the Strasbourg-based court. Hirst who served 25 years for the unprovoked manslaughter of his landlady, said: “You don’t lose your status in civil society just because you’re in prison — you are still a member of the public.” The IRA men Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis 3 TEN IRA men killed by soldiers and the Royal Ulster Constabulary had their human rights violated, the ECHR ruled in 2001. Its judges said the authorities failed to conduct proper inquiries into the deaths. The UK Government was ordered to pay each of the IRA men’s families £10,000. Tory and Ulster Unionist MPs said the ruling was a disgrace and an insult to those who tried to keep the peace. Unionist Ken Maginnis said: “It now seems common practice as far as the European Courts are concerned to pander to militant Irish republicanism.”	European Court of Killers’ Rights	other
863897d7	Theresa May has admitted the Government’s social security experts were not consulted before a controversial decision to deny disability benefits to 160,000 vulnerable people. The Social Security Advisory Committee SSAC was only informed of the changes to Personal Independence Payments PIP “on the day they were being introduced”, MPs were told. The admission was described as “outrageous”, as the row dominated Prime Minister’s Questions and led Jeremy Corbyn to brand the Conservatives “the nasty party” again. Meanwhile, The Independent can reveal that the SSAC will now consider the new PIP regulations at a meeting next Wednesday. It raises the prospect of the committee criticising the decision before MPs vote on it, with a threatened Tory revolt – which must happen before 16 March. The Government is introducing emergency legislation to tighten the criteria for PIP, after a tribunal ruled they should also cover conditions including epilepsy, diabetes and dementia. The ruling would cost at least £3.7bn over the next five years, money which should go to “really disabled people who need it”, one minister said – before later apologising.

Read our privacy notice But one Conservative backbencher has warned the Prime Minister of a growing revolt, urging her to “honour” the verdict delivered by the tribunal. In the Commons, the Labour leader said: “This is a shameful decision that will affect people with dementia, those suffering cognitive disorders due to stroke, military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and those with schizophrenia.” He urged Ms May to “think again” – raising the SSAC, which normally consulted on proposed changes “before the regulations are laid in Parliament”. In reply, the Prime Minister insisted no one currently receiving PIP would “see a reduction in their benefits”. She told MPs: “What the court said is the regulations were unclear – that is why we’re clarifying the regulations and we’re ensuring they reflect the original intention that was agreed by this Parliament.” And she added: “The Work and Pensions Secretary called the chairman of the Social Security Advisory Committee and spoke to him about the regulations on the day they were being introduced.” Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, said later: “Given that these changes will impact over 150,000 disabled people, it is outrageous that the Government did not allow these changes to be considered by the Social Security Committee.” A DWP spokeswoman said it was allowed to bypass the SSAC when announcing new regulations if the decision was a “matter of urgency”. And she argued that was the case with the PIP ruling, which “threatened to undermine the consistency of assessments and create confusion” – although it was made in December. The Independent understands the last time the SSAC was not consulted on a welfare measure was in the previous parliament, over cuts to migrant benefits. Mr Corbyn also attacked the comments by George Freeman, the head of the Downing Street policy unit, noting that Ms May, in 2002, described the Tories as the “nasty party”. “Her policy chair suggested people with debilitating conditions were those who, and I quote, ‘take pills at home, who suffer from anxiety and were not really disabled’. Isn’t that proof the nasty party is still around?” he asked. But Ms May said she hoped MPs would accept Mr Freeman’s apology, issued earlier this week. The tribunal also said that claimants who needed support to take medication should be assessed in the same way as those managing therapies such as dialysis at home.	Dr. Didier Raoult published new results of 1,061 coronavirus patients treated using hdroxychloroquine with 91% success rate. Dr. Raoult found: “Hydroxychloroquine Azithromycin combination, when started immediately after diagnosis, is a safe and efficient treatment for COVID-19, with a mortality rate of 0.5%, in elderly patients. It avoids worsening and clears virus persistence and contagiosity in most cases.” We first wrote about renowned Dr. Didier Raoult after he and his team of French researchers conducted a study which showed that 100% of coronavirus patients that received a combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment. In a follow-up study, which has a larger sample size of 80 COVID-19 patients, the team found a clinical improvement in all but one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74-year old patient still in intensive care unit. The team also found that, by administering hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, they were able to observe an improvement in all cases, except in one patient who arrived with an advanced form, who was over the age of 86, and in whom the evolution was irreversible, according to a new paper published today in IHU Méditerranée Infection. We now have new updates. Tonight, Dr. Oz said during an interview that Dr. Raoult is about to publish the results of his new study. Dr. OZ announced that Dr. Didier Raoult has now treated 1000 coronavirus patient with 99.3% success rate. Of the 1000 patients treatments, 20 patients went to the ICU and 7 patients died. Dr. Raoult said the side effects were trivial things like rash etc. Below is the interview with Dr. Oz talking about his discussion with Dr. Raoul.  The video starts at 21:42 minutes.

97b3e15c	Denying 2000 years of the Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age on every continent Here we go again. For five or so years believers didn’t really mention the Medieval Warm Period. Too bruised by the embarrassment of Hockey Stick Zombie failures. But it’s an inconvenient era they have to rub out because none of the expert models can explain what caused it, and it’s hard to panic about same temperatures that Edward the Confessor survived with oxen and carts. And it’s hard to call the modern warmth “man-made” if nature created something just like it 1,000 years ago. By Michael Collett, ABC, Environmental Copy and Paste Promoter Climate scientists writing in the journal Nature have found there is no evidence for “globally coherent warm and cold periods” over the past 2,000 years prior to industrialisation. That’s significant, because climate change deniers have sometimes pointed to epochs like the so-called “Little Ice Age” or “Medieval Warm Period” to argue that the current global warming is one among multiple similar global climate events. But what the research actually shows is that other “peak warming and cooling events” over the past two millennia appear to have been localised, whereas the human-caused global warming observed over the past 150 years is unparalleled in its global scale (not to mention its absolute temperatures). Who’s denying a million raw data points? This new global temperature reconstruction by The Pages Consortium miraculously agrees with the models yet disagrees with hundreds of stalagmites, corals, ice cores, trees, lake sediments, mud from the ocean floor, pollen dust and 6,000 boreholes. It disagrees with the history of peoples like the Vikings. It disagrees with plants that grew and with trees that survived “above the snowline” that shouldn’t. This map shows just some temperature estimates from all around the world during medieval times relative to today. Many of these papers come from Craig Idso at CO2Science.org who maintains the Medieval Warm Period Project. Back in 2009 when I did this map for the Skeptics Handbook II it was a first. Even then, there were already 442 separate research institutes from 41 countries which had published papers showing the MWP.* Also thanks to Luning and Vahrenholt, and the team at NoTricksZone. The latest paper is trying to claim that all these temperatures were not recorded at the same time and that it wasn’t global. But when proxies are combined it’s obvious it was. Even in our modern warm period, there are still warm and cold records being set at the same time. Medieval times were no different. It’s only by collating and combining many proxies that we can see “the average”. 18 proxies tell us the world was the same or warmer 1,000 years ago Craig Loehle in 2008 used 18 non-tree-ring proxies which included Greenland borehole data, Conroy lake pollen, isotopes from Chesapeake Bay, Sargasso Sea, Caribbean Sea, results from caves in South Africa, the Swiss Alps, Sea Surface reconstructions from Norway, the northern Pacific and the South Atlantic and other proxies too. Temperatures were higher 1000 years ago, and cooler 300 years ago. We started warming long before cars and powerstations were invented. There’s little correlation with CO2 levels. Here’s what 120 proxies from the Northern Hemisphere tell us Ljungqvist et al combined 120 proxies of all different kinds and found this pattern for the last 12 centuries across the Northern Hemisphere. Then there’s Christiansen et al 2012 who followed 32 proxies from the Northern Hemisphere back to the year 0 AD. Here’s the Medieval Warm Period in China Here’s the Medieval Warm Period in Antarctica, and the Little Ice Age: Just in case you thought there wasn’t enough from the Southern Hemisphere. Rosenthal et al 2013 put out quite the zinger of a paper. They’ve reconstructed the temperature of the water flowing out of the Pacific to the Indian Ocean over the last 10,000 years and as deep as 900m. The Indonesian Throughflow is pretty significant in global ocean currents. Clearly that water was warmer 1000 years ago than it was circa 1970. It was even warmer again in the Holocene. 3000 hot and cold years in a South African cave South African Cave last 3000 years Source: Holmgren 2001. See also here and here in African reconstructions. The Southern Ocean 7000 year record also shows long term cooling as well as the Roman Warm Period. Then there’s 10,000 mostly hotter years in Greenland No paleoclimate discussion is complete without GISP: 6,000 Boreholes show it was global Just some of the places these boreholes have been dug. They stick a thermometer down a hole, and all over the world there is a pattern that repeats as temperature changes on the surface travel gradually down through the rocks. Sure, the resolution is bare bones. The data is “smoothed”. We can’t use boreholes to know if things were warmer than today and we can’t tell how long ago that big last surge in warmth was, but where boreholes come into their own is in showing us just how global that last big warm spell was. Below is the latest iteration of a graph that went through a savage evolution from 1997 – 2008. What stayed constant was that boreholes always showed a medieval warm period and a little ice age, that is, except for the time Huang et al “lost” nearly 20,000 years of data. In the graph above, if the assumption about the speed of heat flow is shifted to line up the coolest point with other proxies in 1680 and the warmest point to somewhere around 1000 – 1200 the amplitude would increase (see the jaw dropping 1997 original paper which claimed it was much warmer in medieval times). These papers are by no means the only important ones. There are so many others… So go tell the world — everywhere we look the world was hotter and colder in the last 1000 years, the last 10,000 years and the last billion. h/t George, David B, Original Steve, Peter Fitzroy.

Craig Idso divided up studies into three different levels. Level 1 is the most useful, because they are able to tell us, not just whether the world is warming or not, but but also give a number. The level 2 studies just tell us whether things were warmer or cooler at that location, and with a specific timeframe. The level 3 studies are useful for pinpointing the time frame of the warming. All three levels are represented by orange dots. The numbers come from the level 1 studies. I did not put all the positive ones I could find because there were so many, but I included all the negatives I came across. There were 57 studies of a level 1 category (bound to be more now). There was clearly a warm period and it was clearly global.	Gov’t Seeks to Control ‘Disorderly’ Internet Providers With National Gateway	false
5285404b	Home Run King Hank Aaron Dies of ‘Undisclosed Cause’ 18 Days After Receiving Moderna Vaccine	Baseball legend Hank Aaron, who received the Moderna COVID vaccine on Jan. 5, has died. According to the New York Times, the Atlanta Braves confirmed the 86-year-old Hall of Famer’s death today, but did not provide further details. CNN reported that Aaron died “peacefully in his sleep,” and that no cause of death was disclosed. Aaron made headlines earlier this month when he was photographed getting the Moderna vaccine. He told the Associated Press at the time that getting vaccinated “makes me feel wonderful.” He added: “I don’t have any qualms about it at all, you know. I feel quite proud of myself for doing something like this. … It’s just a small thing that can help zillions of people in this country.” Aaron was vaccinated at the Morehouse School of Medicine health clinic in Atlanta, in what news reports said was an attempt to inspire other Black Americans to step up to the plate and get the vaccine. The AP reported at the time: “Rolling up their sleeves to take the first of two doses, these octogenarians, their spouses and several other civil rights leaders who received the shots in a brand-new health clinic at the Morehouse School of Medicine acknowledged the legacy of mistrust that many African Americans have toward medical research, stemming from the infamous Tuskegee experiment in which U.S. health workers left syphilis untreated in Black men without their consent, making them suffer needlessly.” In December, VOX reported on the launch of a global campaign using influencers and celebrities to help overcome “vaccine hesitancy,” stating that it “will be unprecedented” and many institutions will have a role, including government and public health authorities. However, health officials continue to encounter pushback, including from healthcare workers. Adverse events to the COVID vaccine have been reported worldwide. Germany and Norway have reported a combined 43 deaths among elderly people who received the Pfizer vaccine, prompting China health officials to call for the vaccines to be suspended, especially among the elderly. On learning of Aaron’s death, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., chairman and chief legal counsel for Children’s Health Defense, said: “Aaron’s tragic death is part of a wave of suspicious deaths among elderly closely following administration of COVID vaccines.” “Studies show that self-interested pharmaceutical company researchers, physicians, nursing homes and health officials seldom report vaccine injuries. Instead, they dismiss injuries and deaths as ‘unrelated’ to vaccination,” Kennedy said. “Public health advocates worry that the vast majority of injuries and deaths will go unreported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), the notoriously broken voluntary surveillance system run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).” A 2001 HHS study concluded that “fewer than 1% of vaccine injuries” are reported to VAERS. As The Defender reported last week, California was forced to recall a batch of 330,000 Moderna vaccines after a cascade of reported injuries, though now the company says it’s okay to resume administration of that batch. The Defender also covered the story of a 56-year-old Florida doctor who died about two weeks after getting his first dose of Pfizer’s vaccine. His death is under investigation by Florida health officials. In addition, multiple severe allergic reactions have been directly linked to the Pfizer vaccine.	partially false
745c07fe	"You have been sent here because your child, partner, or friend suggested that you invest your life savings into GameStop stock and you are curious what the fuck is going on. This post is long and thorough and mostly does not discuss memes and ""the internet"" until the end, but if you read it you will hopefully understand What Is Happening. What is going on is that GameStop, a company that sells physical copies of video games next to Auntie Anne’s pretzel shops in dying malls, is the most highly traded asset in the United States, a “meme stock,” and currently the primary front in a micro class war. GameStop’s stock price jumped from $4 last summer to $20 at the end of 2020, to $40 two weeks ago. It was worth $100-ish at times on Monday and Tuesday, and as I write this it is worth close to $300. Essentially, many normal-ish people have made a huge bet against gigantic financial institutions and are currently winning. In practice this means we are seeing one of the largest wealth transfers from the financial ruling class to the middle and middle-upper classes in recent memory, so it is, understandably, the only thing anyone is talking about. How did this happen? A bunch of Redditors in the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, led by a person going by ""DeepFuckingValue,"" analyzed GameStop stock and concluded that its price was undervalued. They then, over the course of months, identified a weakness in the strategies of several giant hedge funds that had bet many millions of dollars that GameStop would fail. These Redditors purchased huge numbers of GameStop stock at low prices (and then kept buying more as the prices rose), held it, and are currently forcing something known as a “short squeeze” that is driving the price up and is emptying these hedge funds in the process. These Redditors are diamond-handing (holding) their stocks, imploring each other to not be a weak-minded stock seller (paper hands) and are waiting for their messiah Ryan Cohen—the CEO of Chewy.com who invested millions in GameStop last year—to hitch them to his rocket and take them to the moon/sun/Mars (become very rich). Advertisement A few weeks ago I became interested in WallStreetBets. I bought 14 shares of GameStop, knowing that if I put a small amount of money in I would actually pay attention to the subreddit and what people were writing about. I did not expect the stock to become worth any money but now I can afford to fix my broken car. I do not have other stocks outside of my 401k. Elon Musk, random venture capitalists, and Mad Money Jim Cramer are all ancillary characters who have made cameos on this journey, and you've got a lot to catch up on: WHAT IS GAMESTOP: GameStop is the number one physical video game retailer in the United States, which means a lot less than it used to in the 1990s, and also has a bunch of stores internationally. GameStop has been closing stores and losing money over the last few years because of the slow death of retail, caused largely by digital storefronts such as Steam and companies like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo opting to sell digital copies of their titles on their own digital stores. The pandemic has also not been good for GameStop. Even though video game sales are skyrocketing, GameStop is a physical store and had to close many locations to comply with COVID-19 restrictions. Sales fell by a third in the first quarter of 2020. Advertisement This has led many financial forecasters to declare that death is inevitable for GameStop, a prognostication that led big hedge funds and capital firms to “short” GameStop stock. WHAT IS ‘SHORTING’ AND WHO IS DOING IT? “Shorting” is a bet that a company's stock will become less valuable. This is done when an investor sells shares of a stock that they do not own. Essentially, they sell shares of a stock at a certain (high) price in the belief that sometime in the near future the price of that stock will go down. They will then be able to buy the stock at the lower price to “cover” their shorts, “closing” the deal and pocketing the difference between the price they sold at and bought at as profit. This is something that giant hedge funds do all the time, often to the chagrin of CEOs like Elon Musk. Often, by betting against a company short sellers are able to put downward pressure on the stock price. What this means is that a struggling company’s stock price can go down simply because a giant hedge fund invests millions or hundreds of millions of dollars shorting it. The mere act of a hedge fund—which are smarter than everyone else, the thinking goes—betting against a company can start a news cycle where investor-types think a company is going to fail, investors sell or get scared, and the stock price goes down. The short sellers win and make a bunch of money. Advertisement Sometimes, however, short sellers lose. This happens when they bet on a stock price to go down, but it goes up instead. The important thing to remember here is that there is theoretically no limit to how much money a short seller can lose. This is because if a short seller shorts a stock at $20, the stock price can continue to go up and the short seller must, at some point, buy that stock to close its position and fulfill its side of the bargain. If I short one stock at $20 and the price of that stock goes to $1 million, I still at some point have to buy that share to close the deal. In this case I would lose $999,980. In this case, a company called Melvin Capital Management shorted millions of dollars in GameStop stock. Another company called Citron Research shorted some large amount of GameStop stock and has also spent much of the last several months explaining why GameStop is a dogshit company that is going to fail. These are companies that most (normal) people have not heard of but are a big deal in the financial world. These companies (as well as a few others), made risky bets that GameStop stock would continue to go down, allowing them to profit immensely, as they usually do. But not this time. WHAT WENT WRONG FOR MELVIN, CITRON, AND THE SHORT SELLERS, INITIALLY As I mentioned earlier, short sellers at some point have to actually buy shares of the company they’ve shorted in order to close their positions and exit their deal. If they do this when a stock's price is higher than their short, they will lock in their losses. So Citron and Melvin and other short sellers have been playing a fabulously expensive game of chicken. Because for the last few months, GameStop stock has slowly been increasing in price. Advertisement The bullish case for GameStop is predicated on the fact that it had a good earnings report earlier this month (its digital sales were up 309 percent), and also saw a big investment from a guy named Ryan Cohen, who is the cofounder of the online pet store Chewy. Chewy is a very successful company and Cohen is seen as a very competent person. Cohen revealed a nearly 10 percent stake in GameStop in September of last year, and upped his stake to nearly 13 percent in December. His investment eventually led to him joining GameStop’s board of directors with ideas like pushing digital sales in tow, which drove investor confidence in the company (because of his prior successes), and pushed the stock price up. It also drove positive media coverage, which, sometimes, can also drive stock prices up. With GME stock prices going up, Melvin, Citron, and short sellers have been waiting for a price crash to cover their positions that has never come. Advertisement The most important thing (as I understand it, at least), and a situation that happens only very rarely, is that short sellers shorted more shares of GameStop than actually exist. What this means is that even if every single short seller wanted to cut their losses and close their positions, they would be unable to do so because the shares don’t exist. Normally this isn’t that much of a problem because over time they’d be able to buy enough stock to close their positions due to people buying and selling stock back and forth. In this case, however, Redditors noticed what was going on and have royally fucked short sellers. Crucially, Redditors on WallStreetBets are holding their stocks Because people haven’t been selling the stock, and because it’s continued to go up, short sellers have been unable to cover their shorts without locking in billions in losses and are unable to cover their shorts entirely because the stock has been over shorted. Here is where things get truly complicated and beyond the scope of this blog. Essentially, you (meaning you, the average person) can buy shares at the market price, no problem. But short sellers want to see a sell-off frenzy, where prices plummet and they can buy huge numbers of shares to reduce their losses or, ideally, lock in their gains. Big short sellers needs to quite literally buy hundreds of thousands or millions of shares, and so they are left waiting for a selling frenzy that may never arrive, or won't come until GameStop has become worth many hundreds or thousands of dollars per share. Advertisement Anyways, this brings us to Reddit and WallStreetBets. WHAT IS WALLSTREETBETS This is what WallStreetBets looks like on Reddit: And this is what it looks like on Discord: And this is what it sounds like: r/WallStreetBets is a subreddit that describes itself as “4chan with a Bloomberg Terminal,” which is the laziest but probably most apt way to think of it. It is a subreddit for people who like to gamble on the stock market that has its own culture, terminology, characters, and villains. It's also very toxic, similar to 4chan. You can broadly think of WallStreetBets as a bunch of investors who think that it is very boring to take a small portion of your paycheck and invest it in your 401k and wait to get old to be rich. It is full of day traders without a ton of money who YOLO their money into a single stock (invest their life savings, or their mom’s life savings, or their student loan payments, or their paychecks), to hopefully realize a giant profit in a short period of time by taking advantage of temporary price movements. Historically, the top posts in this subreddit are “loss porn” and “gain porn,” which are screenshots of people’s investment portfolios showing how they turned a small amount of money into a huge amount of money in a short period of time, or turned a huge amount of money into a tiny amount of money in a short period of time. The broader financial investment world thinks these people are morons and degenerates, and the prevailing financial wisdom is that investing a significant amount of money into specific companies' stocks (versus index funds that mirror the entire market or an entire market sector) is very risky and best left to pros and People Who Know Better, such as giant hedge funds and billionaires. This is the type of advice that financial advisors and podcasters have to give because “take a cash advance on your credit card and invest it all into a stock symbol that you picked randomly from a Ouija board” is not defensible and not advisable to the public at large. Advertisement All of that said, the stock market has been increasingly unmoored from the actual economy, with the stock market as a whole skyrocketing in price over the last 24 months even as hundreds of thousands of people die from a pandemic, millions of people lose their jobs, and billionaires get richer while the rest of us get poorer. Picking random stocks and investing money into them has been a legitimately successful strategy for many people over this short time sample period. It surely will not last. But nonetheless it is working. WALLSTREETBETS AND GAMESTOP In September 2019, a redditor named DeepFuckingValue posted a screenshot of himself investing $53,000 into GameStop stock over the preceding few months, at prices of between 30 cents and 75 cents per share. On that day, his shares were worth $113,000, a gain of 86 percent. GameStop stock was worth 85 cents at the time. This post didn’t take off, but over the months, DeepFuckingValue, who goes by the name ""RoaringKitty"" on YouTube, continued to post updates on their GameStop YOLO. On YouTube, they laid out their case for why they invested in GameStop, which largely came down to GameStop’s strong online sales, the fact that it was closing stores (reducing costs) and that its per-store revenue was increasing as it did so. Advertisement Other redditors and DeepFuckingValue eventually caught on that something else was happening with GameStop stock: It was the most shorted stock in the entire stock market. That, combined with what DeepFuckingValue described as “strong fundamentals,” suggested that, at some point, these short sellers would be forced to close their positions. The opportunity, as I mentioned earlier, is that short sellers overextended themselves and would only be able to close their positions: A) at a loss and B) if suddenly a bunch of people who own GameStop stock sold their stock, which would drive it down. WallStreetBets at the time had more than a million subscribers, and DeepFuckingValue's gain porn was going viral on the subreddit back in December, when the stock prices were around $4. His gains led more people to invest in GameStop, further driving the price up. People began to write treatises on why they believed GameStop was a good investment, leading to more investing. All of this put more pressure on short sellers, which helped snowball the stock up, leading to unrealized gains for all. The rallying cry of the entirety of the WallStreetBets subreddit and its extraordinarily chaotic Discord became: buy GameStop stock, hold it, and fuck over the big hedge funds, specifically Melvin Capital and Citron Research, which, throughout this entire saga, was publishing various YouTube videos about why it believed GameStop stock would go down. Advertisement This created a trollish us-versus-them mentality. If you bought GameStop stock, you are cool and going to become rich. If you sell GameStop stock before you ride its rocket to Mars, you are a coward and are only helping these big hedge funds and fucking over your fellow Redditor. All throughout this, DeepFuckingValue's account went from $50k, to $100k, to several million, to $10 million, to $20 million. DeepFuckingValue did not sell their stock, as far as we know—if they could be brave enough to hold then, you, a lowly investor, could afford to also hold your stock, further driving the price up as Melvin and The Establishment began to sweat. WHY THE STOCK HAS GONE COMPLETELY BANANAS This brings us to this week. By all accounts, Melvin Capital is in deep trouble. Earlier this week, it took in $2.75 billion in funding, reportedly to help cover its GameStop shorts. A prominent venture capitalist said he was buying GameStop stock. Every financial publisher is talking about GameStop stock. Elon Musk, who, again, famously hates Tesla's short sellers with a burning passion, tweeted about GameStop stock and said that he's hanging out in the WallStreetBets Discord. Meanwhile, the GameStop shorts have seemingly not figured out an elegant way out of this. Many prognosticators and analysts on WallStreetBets have been writing posts explaining why they believe GameStop stock will go over $1,000 or $5,000 per share, which involves a scenario where banks and investment platforms themselves require short sellers to cover their shorts all at once, which will make the stock go even crazier than it already has. This seems to be the prevailing wisdom among GME investors at the moment—the stock is worth $350 as I write this, but most people on the subreddit seem unsatisfied. They are out to make a life-changing amount of money and they are out for hedge fund blood. Advertisement IS THIS ILLEGAL / WHO IS GOING TO JAIL? Probably no one is going to jail, but some hedge funds will likely go bankrupt. WallStreetBets is not “manipulating” the market, really. People are posting publicly-available information and their own analyses of what they believe a stock will do, and hundreds of thousands or millions of people are reading that analysis and acting on their own. They are largely doing what stock prognosticators do all day every day on TV shows about stocks. WHAT ABOUT NOKIA, BEST BUY, BLACKBERRY, AMC, ETC WallStreetBets is also investing heavily in Nokia, Best Buy, Blackberry, AMC Theaters, and other stocks. I am not a financial expert and don’t know what will happen with these but in the short term these stocks have also seen large gains (but smaller than GameStop). All of them have been shorted, but not shorted as heavily as GameStop. WHAT THIS ALL MEANS The financial press is trying to explain what this means for them, hedge funds, capitalism, the economy, and the stock market moving forward. Internet culture reporters are trying to explain if this is GOOD or BAD, if this is the Donald Trump-ification of the stock market, where a meme or troll gets out of control and causes unprecedented havoc on the real world. Anthony Scaramucci, of all people, is calling this the ""French Revolution of finance."" It is true that this means something and that this is likely a big moment. We are seeing, I think, the democratization of financial information, at least to some extent. While we've seen technology like deepfakes and facial recognition filter down from research firms and big companies into the hands of ordinary people and amateur technologists who then use them for whatever purposes they want, we are seeing financial technologies, information, and analysis becoming available not just to hedge fund managers, financial institutions, and the very rich, but to the masses. It is clear that there is a sect of WallStreetBets who either previously or currently work in the financial sector who are fed up with increasing inequality, are tired of watching giant corporations repeatedly fuck over ordinary people, and are explaining how it all works to huge groups of people. What they are doing is risky, but it's not ""very stupid."" We have been told for decades that the banks and the people who work at Goldman Sachs and Fidelity and hedge funds none of us have ever heard of are smarter than us, that they deserve to be rich, that they should be the ones who pull the levers on the economy, that they should decide which companies are good and which are bad, that they should be the ones who help make financial regulations. All along the way they have gotten fabulously wealthy and we have been stuck with stagnant wages, record consumer debt, and financial advice that tells us to wait until we are old to retire. WallStreetBets says this is a new paradigm where the masses have the power and hedge funds are scared. A top post on the subreddit this morning was called this: ""FOR ALL THE BIG FUCKING HEDGE FUNDS MONITORING US, THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM US TO YOU, WE FUCKING OWN YOU NOW, FUCK. YOU."" It's unclear how far this will go. After all, people with thousands of dollars to invest in GameStop still have thousands of dollars to invest with, unlike the millions of people in the U.S. currently out of work due to a deadly pandemic. The free investment app of choice, Robinhood, was also just fined by the SEC for hosing its own customers by seeking favorable rebates instead of the best prices for its users. And even if some hedge funds are getting bodied by retail investors, the massive funds such as Fidelity and Blackrock that own tens of millions of GameStop shares are probably just as happy."

3971d0e8	HOUSTON — In the weeks since President Obama’s re-election, Republicans around the country have been wondering how to proceed. Some conservatives in Texas have been asking a far more pointed question: how to secede. Secession fever has struck parts of Texas, which Mitt Romney won by nearly 1.3 million votes. Sales of bumper stickers reading “Secede” — one for $2, or three for $5 — have increased at TexasSecede.com. In East Texas, a Republican official sent out an e-mail newsletter saying it was time for Texas and Vermont to each “go her own way in peace” and sign a free-trade agreement among the states. A petition calling for secession that was filed by a Texas man on a White House Web site has received tens of thousands of signatures, and the Obama administration must now issue a response. And Larry Scott Kilgore, a perennial Republican candidate from Arlington, a Dallas suburb, announced that he was running for governor in 2014 and would legally change his name to Larry Secede Kilgore, with Secede in capital letters. As his Web page, secedekilgore.com, puts it: “Secession! All other issues can be dealt with later.” In Texas, talk of secession in recent years has steadily shifted to the center from the fringe right. It has emerged as an echo of the state Republican leadership’s anti-Washington, pro-Texas-sovereignty mantra on a variety of issues, including health care and environmental regulations. For some Texans, the renewed interest in the subject serves simply as comic relief after a crushing election defeat.

239983c1	To mark one year to go until the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022, the International Olympic Committee IOC has put athletes at the heart of this milestone by featuring their preparation and commitment to getting to the Games during these unprecedented times. Athletes narrate and feature in self-filmed content in a film released on this landmark date. They will also hold live chats and take over @Olympics social handles between 4 and 20 February, the period during which next year’s Games will take place. Welcoming athletes from around the world, IOC President Thomas Bach today formally invited the National Olympic Committees NOC of the world and their winter sports athletes to participate in next year’s Games. Respecting the spirit that the Games are a sporting event, it is the IOC President who invites the NOCs to the Olympic Games. Given the current circumstances, this was done today from Olympic House in Lausanne, Switzerland. The IOC President symbolically signed and sent invitations to eight NOCs, including the Chinese Olympic Committee. The other seven NOCs were the Hellenic Olympic Committee, which is located in the country in which the Olympic Games originated; the NOCs from future Olympic Games host cities – the Japanese Olympic Committee for Tokyo 2020; the Comité National Olympique et Sportif Français for Paris 2024; the Comitato Olimpico Nazionale Italiano for Milano Cortina 2026, the successor of Beijing; and the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee for LA28 – as well as the Australian Olympic Committee and the Nigerian Olympic Committee, which sent the largest delegations from Oceania and Africa respectively to the last Olympic Winter Games. All eight NOCs accepted the invitation via a video message. Speaking about this milestone, Bach said: “One year from now, Beijing will write history as the first city ever to host both the summer and winter editions of the Olympic Games. These Games will connect the Chinese people with the world.” He continued: “Having seen how China is overcoming the coronavirus crisis, we are very confident that our Chinese hosts will ensure safe and secure Olympic Games in full cooperation with the IOC. Every time that I have visited China, I am so impressed by the enthusiasm and support for the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022. This is why, we can say already now with great confidence: China is ready. Ready to welcome the world’s best winter sports athletes for unforgettable Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022. We all are looking forward to this global celebration of sport.” The digitally-led #StrongerTogether campaign focuses on athletes around the world and their solidarity and progress towards the Games. As part of this, the IOC has published the #StrongerTogether film, which showcases athletes’ preparations for next year’s Games, distributed globally across digital, social and partner media channels. Narrated by Chinese freestyle skier Eileen Gu, it features iconic moments of past Olympic Winter Games, a glimpse of Beijing 2022’s venues, and self-filmed content from athletes’ preparations, as they get ready to go to Beijing 2022. A number of digital partnerships will boost interest in this milestone. Twitter will run a unique emoji feature when users tweet @Olympics with #StrongerTogether and the ❄️ emoji; while a special Beijing 2022 filter will be available on Snapchat. Iconic winter Olympic moments will be released daily on the Olympic Channel and @Olympics Twitter, and there will be athlete takeovers and inspirational talks on the Olympics Instagram. The IOC’s Worldwide Olympic Partners and Rights-Holding Broadcasters will also be activating this landmark over the coming days. Some of the notable activities being organised include the unveiling of a physical countdown clock in Beijing by OMEGA, the Official Timekeeper of the Olympic Games. In addition, fans will be able to interact live with winter athletes, some on their road to Beijing 2022, through the Olympian and Paralympian Online Experiences launched with Worldwide Olympic and Paralympic Partner Airbnb. Omega In China, a One Year to Go celebration show was broadcast on national television. In addition to celebrating this special milestone with a cultural spectacular, the Beijing 2022 Organising Committee also unveiled the official Beijing 2022 torch design. The event was held in the Ice Cube formerly known as the Water Cube, which will host curling at next year’s Games. The official torches for the #Beijing2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games have been unveiled! 🔥❄ Find out more about the designs here 👉 https://t.co/Du0fG2jW4J#StrongerTogether #1YearToGo pic.twitter.com/z2t9W7kPlS — Olympics @Olympics February 4, 2021 Preparations for next year’s Games in China remain on track, and excitement is building across the country. All competition venues were completed by the end of 2020, with the remaining renovations and construction to be finished by the end of this year. With the aim of getting 300 million people engaged in winter sports and having received around one million applications for volunteer positions, the Beijing 2022 Games will be transformative for both China and the global winter sports scene. There will be winter sports before the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 and a new era of winter sports afterwards. This can already be seen from the numbers. Five years ago, there were only 460 ski resorts in China. This number grew to 644 by the end of 2019. The Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 will also have a strong emphasis on sustainability. All venues will be powered by 100 per cent renewable energy, while natural, low-carbon-emission CO 2 refrigeration systems will be used at most of the Beijing 2022 ice venues – the first time this low climate impact technology will be used in China and at the Olympic Winter Games. Furthermore, 7 out of the 12 competition and non-competition venues within the Beijing 2022 competition zone will be legacy venues from Beijing 2008. Beijing will host the XXIV Olympic Winter Games from 4 to 20 February 2022. ### The International Olympic Committee is a not-for-profit, civil, non-governmental, international organisation made up of volunteers which is committed to building a better world through sport. It redistributes more than 90 per cent of its income to the wider sporting movement, which means that every day the equivalent of USD 3.4 million goes to help athletes and sports organisations at all levels around the world. ### For more information, please contact the IOC Media Relations Team: Tel: +41 21 621 6000, email: pressoffice@olympic.org, or visit our web site at www.olympic.org.

The high-level police source within the Sheriff’s Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. During the IG’s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI’s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine’s Day. “We constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. ‘See something, say something’ is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,” Governor Scott said. According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel’s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn’t the sole reason why he is being removed. The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week. Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine’s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel’s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting. It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff’s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL. Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy. In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff’s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel’s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying. Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates. Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff’s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff’s car that read, “Our new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?” The tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike who quipped that the Broward Sheriff’s office should use the funds to pay for better officer training, not new cars. Leaders on both sides of the aisle have called for Sheriff Israel to resign or be removed by the Governor for his extreme dereliction of duty and failure to prevent one of the worst schools shootings in US history. During the Florida GOP Primary debate in Florida last week, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and Rep. Ron DeSantis were asked about the Parkland school shooting. Both Putnam and DeSantis called for the removal of Scott Israel while asserting their support of the Second Amendment. “I would have removed that sheriff from Broward County. He failed his citizens and he should have been removed,” DeSantis said. “Sheriff Israel is under investigation and he needs to go,” Putnam said. Governor Scott is expected to release a statement in the coming week when Sheriff Israel is removed from office. Scott is currently running for US Senate in Florida, and news of Sheriff Israel’s removal is sure to boost his approval rating in what is gearing up to be one of the most important Senate races in the country. In the days following the Parkland shooting, Sheriff Scott Israel was confronted and asked about his support of and affiliation with the Democratic Party and why he chose to blame guns instead of holding his department and the FBI accountable. Unable to withstand tough questioning, Sheriff Israel became flustered and ended the interview after saying, “the only person accountable for this killing is the detestable, cowardly, murderer. He is solely responsible for this horrific act.” However, as the investigation into Parkland has shown, both Sheriff Israel and the FBI dropped the ball and are to blame for their failure to prevent the shooting despite receiving multiple warning signs.

b9ccbcb4	Though health officials have warned Americans to prepare for the spread of the novel coronavirus in the U.S., people shouldn’t wear face masks to prevent the spread of the infectious illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. surgeon general. But that’s not the only reason Americans may want to think twice about using masks, one expert told MarketWatch. Most people don’t know how to use face masks correctly, and a rush to buy masks could prevent the people who need them most — health care providers — from getting them, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a scholar at the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In fact the U.S. surgeon general recently urged the public to “STOP BUYING MASKS!” “They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!,” wrote Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Twitter US:TWTR The CDC said last month it doesn’t recommend people use face masks, making the announcement on the same day that first case of person-to-person transmission of coronavirus was reported in the U.S. The CDC recommendation on masks stands, a spokesman told MarketWatch Wednesday, even with the first reported case of a COVID-19 infection in an individual in California who had not been to China or been exposed to a person diagnosed with the virus. “The virus is not spreading in the general community,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the Center for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a Jan. 30 briefing. “We don’t routinely recommend the use of face masks by the public to prevent respiratory illness. And we certainly are not recommending that at this time for this new virus.” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said Tuesday, “Our advice remains as it has been that the average American does not need a N95 mask. These are really more for health care providers.” N95 masks are tighter-fitting than surgical masks and protect against small particles and large droplets, according to the CDC. Azar said that there are only 30 million N95 masks in the national stockpile, adding that there are “as many as 300 million masks needed in the U.S. for health care workers.” There were 86 cases of COVID-19 and two reported deaths in the U.S., as of Monday. See also: Alpha Pro Tech’s stock rockets as coronavirus outbreak leads to a big spike in face mask orders Americans don't seem to be heeding health officials’ advice: Walgreens US:WBA and Duane Reade pharmacies have seen increased demand for face masks and hand sanitizer across the country, said Alexandra Brown, a spokeswoman for Walgreens, which owns both chains. “We continually and closely monitor these types of situations to ensure that we have sufficient supply of those products,” she said. Several sites have sold out of face masks entirely. Target’s US:TGT brand of face masks, priced at $5.99 for a 10-pack, were out of stock on its site as of Thursday. A Target spokeswoman declined to comment on when the face masks would be back in stock. There were still some face masks available on Amazon US:AMZN last Thursday, though many were quickly becoming out of stock. A pack of 20 3M US:MMM face masks was available for $129 on Thursday morning, but by midday it had sold out. In April last year the same pack of masks cost $9.99, according to camelcamelcamel.com, a site that tracks historic prices of goods sold on Amazon. Amazon and 3M did not respond to requests for comment on when customers could expect to purchase masks that are currently out of stock. To protect against a mask shortage, Home Depot US:HD US:HD US:HD US:HD US:HD has “limited purchase quantity to 10 [masks] per person to best serve as many customers as possible,” said Margaret Smith, a Home Depot spokeswoman. “Our merchandising and supply chain teams are working hard to replenish these items as quickly as possible.” CVS US:CVS has also seen a surge in sales of face masks. The demand “may cause shortages at some store locations and we’ll re-supply those stores as quickly as possible,” Stephanie Cunha, a CVS spokeswoman, said last month. Adalja applauded the CDC’s recommendation on face masks. “Even during H1N1 [flu epidemic], there was no recommendation to wear face masks,” he said. They “end up creating a false sense of security and most people don’t wear them appropriately,” he said. People who are not in the medical field who wear the masks often come in contact with germs when they lift the mask up to eat or slip their fingers under the mask to blow their nose, he said. Panic-driven demand for face masks, Adalja said, is particularly worrisome because it could have “a negative supply shock” effect on hospital personnel who need these masks more than the general public. Like the surgeon general, Adalja said, “the best ways [for the general public] to protect themselves are the basic hygienic measures.” That includes washing your hands regularly and covering sneezes and coughs. But if you are “sick and need to go out you should wear a mask.” Instead of wearing face masks, the general public should “be vigilant to the symptoms and signs of this novel coronavirus, that is, a fever and cough, and if you have those symptoms, please call your health-care provider,” Messonnier said last month. “We want our actions to be evidence-based and appropriate to the current circumstance,” she said, which she said did not justify the use of face masks for people who have not been directly exposed to the virus. The CDC has said it expects to see more coronavirus cases in the U.S. “It’s not so much a question of if … but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness, Messonnier said on Feb. 25. There are still many unknowns about how this strain of coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, spreads, but when person-to-person spread has occurred in the past, “it is thought to have happened via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread,” the CDC said on its website. Like the CDC, the World Health Organization advises people to wear a mask only if they are displaying symptoms of coronavirus or “taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection.” In a separate update last month, the WHO gave instructions for how to appropriately wear and dispose of face masks. WHO also noted, “However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide the adequate level of protection and other equally relevant measures should be adopted.” WHO advises people who wish to wear a mask to place the mask “carefully to cover mouth and nose and tie securely to minimise any gaps between the face and the mask,” avoid touching the mask while you’re wearing it, and dispose of masks as soon as they become damp or humid. When removing the face mask, WHO recommends that people “do not touch the front but remove the lace from behind.” Worldwide, 89,197 people have been infected with COVID-19, and at least 3,048 have died as of Monday.

054fefab	January 11, 2017 WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.) today urged Senate Democrats to work with Republicans to repeal Obamacare and clear the way for solutions that will expand access to quality, affordable health care for all Americans. A vote on legislation that provides Congress the tools to repeal Obamacare is expected in the Senate later today. “Democrats have failed to live up to nearly every promise they made when they forced Obamacare through Congress without a single Republican vote,” Blunt said. “Despite all of their claims to the contrary, this law has forced millions of Americans off the plans and doctors they liked and could afford, drastically driven up premiums and deductibles, and slashed the number of health plan options available to families.” This year, 97 Missouri counties have only one insurer participating in the Obamacare exchanges. Last year, every Missouri county had at least two insurance options. In addition, most Missourians will see an increase in their premiums, with some facing an increase upward of 40 percent. Blunt continued, “Now is the time for Senate Democrats to start making things right. They’ll have that opportunity today when the Senate considers a resolution that gives Congress the tools to repeal Obamacare and pave the way for solutions that will expand access to quality, affordable health care. By taking this first step toward repealing Obamacare, Republicans are keeping the promises we made to the American people. I urge all of my Democrat colleagues to do the same.”	SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES No. 18A335 RICHARD BRAKEBILL, ET AL. v.

ab66dbab	Bacon, burgers and sausages are as big a cancer threat as cigarettes, global health chiefs are to rule. The World Health Organisation is to list processed meat among the most cancer-causing substances, alongside arsenic and asbestos. Fresh red meat is also due to join the ‘encyclopaedia of carcinogens’ and is likely to be ranked as only slightly less dangerous than the preserved products. Scroll down for video The World Health Organisation is to list processed meat among the most cancer-causing substances, alongside arsenic and asbestos The rulings, revealed to the Mail by a well-placed source, will send shock waves through the farming industry and the fast food sector. They could also lead to new dietary guidelines and warning labels on packs of bacon. The classifications, by the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer, come amid mounting concern that meat fuels the disease which claims more than 150,000 lives a year in the UK. Links to bowel cancer, Britain’s second biggest cancer killer, are particularly strong, with estimations that half of cases could be prevented by healthier lifestyles. The Department of Health’s scientific advisers recently concluded that red and processed meat ‘probably’ increase the odds of bowel cancer. But the WHO is expected to go further by saying processed meat causes cancer. The decision, due on Monday, follows a meeting of scientists from ten nations, including the UK, who reviewed all available evidence. Smoking: Scientists are believed to have agreed processed meat is ‘carcinogenic to humans’, the highest of five possible rankings, shared with alcohol, asbestos, arsenic and cigarettes They are believed to have agreed processed meat is ‘carcinogenic to humans’, the highest of five possible rankings, shared with alcohol, asbestos, arsenic and cigarettes. Risks and benefits must be considered together before telling people what to eat, drink, drive, breathe, or where to work Barry Carpenter, president of the North American Meat Institute Processed meat is made by smoking, curing, salting, or adding chemicals. Examples are ham, bacon, pastrami and salami, as well as hot dogs and some sausages. Burgers are also expected to be included. Red meat is expected to be one rung below, ‘probably carcinogenic to humans’. Meat in general contains high concentrations of fat and it is thought the compound that gives meat its red colour may damage the bowel lining. Processed meat has previously been blamed for one in 30 deaths and is seen as dangerous because preserving techniques can raise levels of cancer-causing chemicals. It is estimated that if intake was cut to 20g a day – a rasher of bacon a day or an English breakfast once a week – almost 20,000 early deaths would be prevented in the UK each year. Ruling: The World Health Organisation is to list processed meat among the most cancer-causing substances, alongside arsenic and asbesto Any advice to cut, or avoid, processed meat will be welcomed by cancer charities. But it could have huge repercussions for the meat industry, which will be mindful that sugar sales fell last year after the WHO issued a warning on overconsumption. The beef sector makes £2.8billion for the economy and provides 440,000 jobs in England. The North American Meat Institute NAMI said the report defied 'both common sense and dozens of studies showing no correlation between meat and cancer'. 'Red and processed meat are among 940 substances reviewed by International Agency for Research IARC on found to pose some level of theoretical 'hazard,' said Barry Carpenter, president of NAMI. 'IARC says you can enjoy your yoga class, but don’t breathe air Class I carcinogen, sit near a sun-filled window Class I, drink wine or coffee Class I and Class 2A,, eat grilled food Class 2A, or apply aloe vera Class 2B. 'Risks and benefits must be considered together before telling people what to eat, drink, drive, breathe, or where to work.' The industry says red meat is rich in protein, a good source of vitamins, iron and zinc, and a key part of a balanced diet. Professor Richard Knox, a former Institute of Cancer Research expert, said ‘most cancer deaths will not be due to bowel cancer and even fewer linked to meat consumption’. Government guidelines on red meat, given in 2011, recommend adults eat no more than 70g a day.	Trump aims new blasts at McCain, claims credit for funeral	false

842ac903	"Rep. Leon Young figures the Wisconsin Legislature already works just part-time. So maybe it should get paid that way. Earlier this week, Young, D-Milwaukee, floated the idea of a constitutional amendment calling for lawmakers to meet just the first three months of the year and cut their pay by 75 percent — to $12,000 a year from the current $49,943. ""After reviewing the number of days that we were in session during the course of the 2011-12 biennium, I realized that we met a total of only 34 days out of a possible 122 session days,"" Young said. ""It is fair to say that we actually function as a 'de facto' part-time legislature now."" When you look only at the number of session days in 2012, Young said, the number drops to seven. ""Who works seven days and gets paid for a whole year?"" he asked. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Wisconsin is among 10 states where the salaries are highest, there are large staffs and ""legislators are paid enough to make a living without requiring outside income."" A similar proposal to cut the pay and budget of the Milwaukee County Board has been introduced and is gaining support among some Republicans, who control both houses of the Legislature. That measure, being floated by state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, and Rep. Joe Sanfelippo, R-West Allis, would allow voters to decide whether to cut supervisors' pay to $15,000 a year from the current $51,000, eliminate health and pension benefits and make deep cuts in the board's $6.5 million annual budget. It will be interesting to see whether lawmakers view a part-time Legislature with the same enthusiasm as a part-time Milwaukee County Board. Young said he's gotten a ""couple of calls"" from fellow lawmakers in recent days, ""some in support; some not too happy, actually."" Rough times for Democracy Campaign The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, one of the state's strongest voices for government transparency, has hit a rough patch. Over the holidays, the Madison-based group was informed it would soon lose funding from the Joyce Foundation, which had supported the nonprofit for 16 years. Executive Director Mike McCabe said he is working to generate new sources of revenue to replace the $232,000 in lost Joyce funding. The Democracy Campaign's annual budget is $430,000 a year. McCabe said his highest priority is maintaining the group's searchable database that tracks donations to state candidates and associated research — which costs roughly $130,000 a year. ""We want to at least maintain our tracking program and searchable database and maintain the capacity to do research and analysis to connect the dots between all that (campaign) money and the votes at the Capitol,"" McCabe said. Some speculate that McCabe's often pointed critique of officials has generated more enemies than friends for the Democracy Campaign. ""I make no apologies for advocating for a system that values people over money,"" he said. ""I am bound and determined to keep this going."" If he fails, McCabe said, ""There will probably be some Capitol insiders that would be very happy."""		false

cd9cd5e8	MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin oversaw a test Wednesday of a new hypersonic glide vehicle, declaring that the weapon is impossible to intercept and will ensure Russia’s security for decades to come. Speaking to Russia’s top military brass after watching the live feed of the launch of the Avangard vehicle from the Defense Ministry’s control room, Putin said the successful test was a “great success” and an “excellent New Year’s gift to the nation.” The test comes amid bitter tensions in Russia-U.S. relations, which have sunk to their lowest level since the Cold War times over the conflict in Ukraine, the war in Syria and the allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Putin's hopes for repairing ties with Washington under President Donald Trump have fizzled amid investigations into allegations of Trump's campaign ties with Russia, and tensions have escalated as the U.S. administration slapped Russia with new waves of sanctions. The Avangard was among the array of new nuclear weapons that Putin presented in March, saying that Russia had to develop them in response to the development of the U.S. missile defense system that could erode Russia’s nuclear deterrent. From the left, Sergei Ivanov, Russian special representative on questions of ecology and transport, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Chief of General Staff of Russia Valery Gerasimov, oversee the test launch of the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle from the Defense Ministry's control room in Moscow, Russia, Wednesday, Dec. 26, 2018. Mikhail Klimentyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP In Wednesday's test, the weapon was launched from the Dombarovskiy missile base in the southern Ural Mountains. The Kremlin said it successfully hit a designated practice target on the Kura shooting range on Kamchatka, 6,000 kilometers 3,700 miles away. × Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief - a daily roundup of military and defense news stories from around the globe. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief. The Avangard is invulnerable to intercept by any existing and prospective missile defense means of the potential adversary, Putin said after the test, adding that the new weapon will enter service next year with the military's Strategic Missile Forces. When first presenting the Avangard in March, the Russian leader said the new system has an intercontinental range and can fly in the atmosphere at 20 times the speed of sound, bypassing the enemy's missile defense. He emphasized that no other country currently has hypersonic weapons. Putin has said that Avangard is designed using new composite materials to withstand temperatures of up to 2,000 degrees Celsius 3,632 degrees Fahrenheit that come from a flight through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.

We must be sure we don’t have a situation where vulnerable people are dragged into the black economy and become victims of slavery Charlie Elphicke A rise in numbers trying to cross the Channel from northern France has seen border security stretched to breaking point. Many of those intercepted are thought to have been set free to join illegal immigrants already here. The alarming Home Office statistic released to the Daily Express under Freedom of Information laws may even be the tip of the iceberg. There was anger last night at the laxness of Charlie Elphicke, the Tory MP for Dover, said: “It is very concerning that some 12,000 asylum seekers failed to turn up for interview. “We need to know if the Government has lost track of them. We must be sure we don’t have a situation where vulnerable people are dragged into the black economy and become victims of slavery. “This is why it is so important these people are found.” The UK’s booming black economy is estimated to be worth £150billion, supporting at least 1.1 million people who could be here illegally. The scale of those who have disappeared from under the noses of immigration officials emerged after the Daily Express asked to know the whereabouts of five Iranians who sailed here in a dinghy.

Ukip defence spokesman, MEP Mike Hookem, said: “The Home Office thinks it’s likely that people who land here illegally will be allowed to go free and return for an appointment another time.

a655530c	"DATE: November 1, 2015 TO: USF & NRA Members and Friends FROM: Marion P. Hammer USF Executive Director NRA Past President Many folks remember that during the fight to pass Florida's Concealed Carry law, the Florida Sheriffs Association opposed concealed carry. They literally said they didn't like ""hidden guns."" At the time, open carry was legal in Florida and had been for decades. They said if people were going to be allowed to carry guns, they needed to carry them openly so law enforcement officers could see them and know who had guns -- they claimed it was a matter of officer safety. Now, they have reversed positions. They claim concealed carry is fine and they don't mind concealed guns. BUT, open carry is dangerous. They claim they won't know the good guys from the bad guys, and one sheriff (now retired) said law enforcement would have to ""draw down"" and anybody carrying openly. You've probably heard or read most of the rhetoric. They always lead off saying they are strong Second Amendment supporters then proceed to explain why they OPPOSE Second Amendment rights.

In recent Palm Beach Post Blog articles and a Tampa Bay Times Blog article, the Chairman of the Florida Sheriffs Association's Legislative Committee (FSA) is quoted with some erroneous claims regarding the proposed open carry bill in Florida (SB-300 by Sen. Don Gaetz and HB-163 by Rep. Matt Gaetz). Below are some of those claims and our responses. FSA CLAIM: ""The bill as currently drafted is extremely broad, lacking limits on when, how or where firearms could be carried."" FACT: The same provisions and restrictions that apply to concealed carry also apply to open carry (s.790.06). Only a person with a license to carry concealed will be able to carry openly. Additionally, the improper exhibition of firearms law (s.790.10) applies whether carrying concealed or openly. Further, because of these and other erroneous claims, a clarification amendment, to stop open carry opponents from continuing to make such false claims, was added to the bill in Senate Criminal Justice Committee the morning of 10/20/15 – We know the spokesman made that claim even AFTER the clarification amendment was added because the spokesman made reference to an amendment ""that didn't pass"" in the same committee meeting. Since the FSA spokesman obviously doesn't want to believe the NRA's data, the following data was provided by Florida Carry, Inc. – and their data confirms ours. FSA CLAIM: ""The bill's proponents claim that 45 other states already allow open-carry. But that's not really accurate."" FACT: To the contrary, it is accurate. Forty-five (45) states allow open carry of firearms. Varying restrictions on open carry in some states does not alter the fact that 45 states allow open carry. 15 of 45 open carry states require a license to carry concealed or openly. 30 of 45 open carry states do not require any license to carry openly 0 of 15 of the concealed carry license states require additional training to carry openly 0 of 45 states offer a separate ""open carry"" license 2 of 45 states require an open carry holster. On 1/1/16 Texas will require a holster. 0 of 45 states require a retention holster. 5 of 15 are ""may-issue"" states where law enforcement issues licenses 15 of 15 states require the license holder to produce the license on lawful demand by a law enforcement officer. FSA CLAIM: ""... most open-carry states have strict rules about ... producing the permit on demand."" FACT: This is a red herring. FLORIDA law already requires license holders to produce a license on demand by a law enforcement officer. And for the record, all 15 states that require a license, require producing the license on lawful demand by a law enforcement officer. FSA CLAIM: ""...[I]t's ‘intellectually dishonest' to say open carry laws are working in the 45 other states because there are so many variations in the laws and the demographics. FACT: The open carry laws are working in 45 states. Opponents have presented no evidence to the contrary – no evidence that it isn't working in any state and no evidence of problems in any state. These are just baseless allegations. Simply because different states have variations in their laws does not in any way alter the fact that open carry is allowed and that it’s working. FSA CLAIM: ""In Pennsylvania, for example, cities can opt out of its open carry law and some, including Philadelphia, do just that, Gualtieri said. Florida cities don't have the option to opt out of a state law."" FACT: Pennsylvania DOES NOT allow cities to opt out of its open carry law. Pennsylvania does not require a license for a person to carry openly. Philadelphia cannot ""opt out"" of the state open carry law. Pennsylvania state law allows the city of Philadelphia (and only Philadelphia) to require a license to carry openly in Philadelphia. FSA CLAIM: As for demographics, ""You can't compare Sioux Falls, S.D. to downtown Miami or downtown Tampa or downtown Orlando,"" Gualtieri said. FACT: This argument is illogical and perhaps intentionally misleading. Seventy percent (70%) of the American public live in open carry states from all regions of the country. Many of the 45 open carry states have large and diverse cities just like Florida and where you live geographically, whether it's Trilby, FL or Fanning Springs, FL, you have the same constitutional rights as citizens who live in Miami, Tampa, or Orlando. FSA CLAIM: ""...the state's trespass law gives businesses the right to ask anyone openly carrying a weapon to leave their property,"" but they ... ""will be reluctant to tell a person wearing a .45 to leave."" FACT: Posting signs prohibiting open carry inside a business establishment is a simple solution. Proper notification will stop citizens from even entering the establishment. Property owners already must post trespass signs to notify the public to stay off private property. Businesses have the right to refuse service and evict anyone they wish unless it's done on the basis of race, gender, or religion. Further, it is common to see signs that say, ""No shirt, no shoes - no service."" Why are they reluctant to post signs saying, ""No open carrying of firearms?"" FSA CLAIM: ""..if you are McDonald's you won't be able to exclude somebody from putting their gun on the table and sitting there and eating."" FACT: Again, any business may evict a customer for behavior they deem to be offensive, dangerous or inappropriate. Further it is a criminal offense under s.790.10 to exhibit a firearm in a rude or careless manner."	Primary school pupil numbers soaring	partially false
5daad203	"TALLAHASSEE — As the Florida Legislature finished its historic special session and sent a revamped redistricting map back to the state Supreme Court on Tuesday, another kind of history was being made. Dozens of state House members were voluntarily house hunting, running for a different office, or planning to sit out the next legislative session to avoid a matchup with another lawmaker. Republican James Grant filed papers Tuesday to run in a Pinellas-Hillsborough district that will force him to leave his current Carrollwood home. Rep. Perry Thurston, the incoming Democratic leader, planned to move in with his mom. Republican Eddy Gonzalez planned to rent in the Hialeah neighborhood where he grew up. And Rep. Scott Plakon of Longwood was ready to move in with his adult son a town over. ""It's historic,'' said Rep. Will Weatherford, the Wesley Chapel Republican and incoming House speaker who led the House's redistricting effort. ""It's the first time in the nation this many members have been drawn into the same districts where it wasn't a court order."" The result, he said: ""a lot of blood, sweat and tears,'' and a gradual realization that ""having control of our own destiny and our own maps was more important than anybody's individual political agenda."" The House completed the two-week legislative redistricting session Tuesday and voted 61-47 to pass the Senate's revamped map without change. The Florida Supreme Court had rejected the first Senate map for failing to follow the requirements of the new Fair Districts standards. The new proposal, which appears to create more visually compact districts than the first, also creates one less Republican majority seat, giving the GOP a 23-15 statistical advantage, with two swing districts. Democrats maligned the Senate's second map, saying it was fraught with many of the same problems as the first — from protecting incumbents, inexplicably dividing cities and counties and failing to protect minority voting strength. ""We'll see you in court,'' Florida Democratic Party spokeswoman Brannon Jordan said in a terse statement. Miami-Dade Republicans joined with Democrats in opposing the map, voicing concern that the proposal doesn't create enough Hispanic districts despite huge gains in the population over the last decade. But Weatherford said he considered the Senate map constitutional and warned that rejecting the map would set a ""very dangerous precedent."" Unlike the Senate map, the House's proposed plan was approved by the court on the first review. Weatherford believes that was because legislators were willing to ""put the process and the chamber above themselves."" He recalls telling members after Fair Districts passed in November 2010: ""There will be political carnage from this."" For the next 18 months, every opportunity he had, he said, he would ""just hammer that home."" ""It conditioned the members and allowed them to come to terms with, early on, the fact that it was going to be a hard process,"" Weatherford said Tuesday. To ease the transition, Weatherford made a promise to any Republican House member who moved into a new district that he would protect them during the election season. ""It made the decision a little bit easier for some members,'' said Rep. Carlos Lopez Cantera, the House Republican leader. Still, Grant said the process was ""very tough."" Grant not only grew up in the district he now represents, but he lives 500 yards from his parents' home. He's moving to a redrawn district to the west that includes a majority of his current constituents. The move also means Grant will avoid a primary with Rep. Shawn Harrison, R-Lutz. ""No one ever expected to me leave Carrollwood,'' Grant said. But he said his father, the former state Sen. John Grant, had seen redistricting tangles before and ""was adamant that when I ran, I rent, rather than buy."" Thurston's move to his mother's home in Lauderhill will avoid a matchup with Rep. Elaine Schwartz, D-Hollywood. ""It's just two years,'' he said. ""Anybody can do anything for two years."" Rep. Scott Plakon, R-Longwood, will move into a neighboring district with his adult son to avoid being matched up with Rep. Chris Dorworth, R-Lake Mary, who is slated to become House speaker after Weatherford. Only two current legislators — Reps. Jose Felix Diaz and Ana Rivas Logan, both Miami Republicans — don't see moving as an option. They plan to fight it out all summer for the lone seat. ""I own my house,'' Diaz said Tuesday. ""If the economy were different, maybe I could move, but it's not an option."" Times news artist Darla Cameron contributed to this report."

c4f8a375	I have just been to Buckingham Palace, where Her Majesty The Queen has asked me to form a new government, and I accepted. In David Cameron, I follow in the footsteps of a great, modern Prime Minister. Under David’s leadership, the government stabilised the economy, reduced the budget deficit, and helped more people into work than ever before. But David’s true legacy is not about the economy but about social justice. From the introduction of same-sex marriage, to taking people on low wages out of income tax altogether; David Cameron has led a one-nation government, and it is in that spirit that I also plan to lead. Because not everybody knows this, but the full title of my party is the Conservative and Unionist Party, and that word ‘unionist’ is very important to me. It means we believe in the Union: the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But it means something else that is just as important; it means we believe in a union not just between the nations of the United Kingdom but between all of our citizens, every one of us, whoever we are and wherever we’re from. That means fighting against the burning injustice that, if you’re born poor, you will die on average 9 years earlier than others. If you’re black, you’re treated more harshly by the criminal justice system than if you’re white. If you’re a white, working-class boy, you’re less likely than anybody else in Britain to go to university. If you’re at a state school, you’re less likely to reach the top professions than if you’re educated privately. If you’re a woman, you will earn less than a man. If you suffer from mental health problems, there’s not enough help to hand. If you’re young, you’ll find it harder than ever before to own your own home. But the mission to make Britain a country that works for everyone means more than fighting these injustices. If you’re from an ordinary working class family, life is much harder than many people in Westminster realise. You have a job but you don’t always have job security. You have your own home, but you worry about paying a mortgage. You can just about manage but you worry about the cost of living and getting your kids into a good school. If you’re one of those families, if you’re just managing, I want to address you directly. I know you’re working around the clock, I know you’re doing your best, and I know that sometimes life can be a struggle. The government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few, but by yours. We will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives. When we take the big calls, we’ll think not of the powerful, but you. When we pass new laws, we’ll listen not to the mighty but to you. When it comes to taxes, we’ll prioritise not the wealthy, but you. When it comes to opportunity, we won’t entrench the advantages of the fortunate few. We will do everything we can to help anybody, whatever your background, to go as far as your talents will take you. We are living through an important moment in our country’s history. Following the referendum, we face a time of great national change. And I know because we’re Great Britain, that we will rise to the challenge. As we leave the European Union, we will forge a bold new positive role for ourselves in the world, and we will make Britain a country that works not for a privileged few, but for every one of us. That will be the mission of the government I lead, and together we will build a better Britain.	"BRAZIL'S health authority has confirmed a volunteer has died after participating in the clinical trials of the coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. The country's health authority, Anvisa confirmed one person died in trials. However, it is understood the man took a placebo rather than the vaccine and the health authority confirmed trials will continue. The drug is currently undergoing phase three clinical trials. Brazil has plans in place to purchase the drug and produce it at its biomedical research centre if it clears the final phase of trials. Despite the death of the volunteer, Oxford University has stated there are no concerns surrounding the safety of the trials. The vaccine is seen as one of the leading drugs, with the UK Government signing a deal for 100 million doses. Trials of the drug were also put on hold in the US since September 6 after a volunteer fell ill. Both India and South Africa have resumed clinical trials of the potential vaccine. AstraZeneca has also signed an agreement with Europe's Inclusive Vaccine Alliance. Under this, 400 million doses could be ready to supply European countries who participate in the alliance. The UK has also secured 30 million doses of a separate drug made by BioNtech/Pfizer. Another deal worth 60 million doses, has also been agreed with Valneva - in total there are six vaccines under consideration by the Goverent. Despite this, it is uncertain when a vaccine will be in circulation or how successful it will be. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, warned it is unlikely a drug will be available until next spring. Speaking to the  Commons and Lords National Security Strategy Committee, he stated the virus will not be completely eradicated either. He said: ""It is unlikely we will end up with a truly sterilising vaccine.” Previously, officials had claimed the drug produced by AstraZeneca could be available by the turn of the year. Head of the UK's Vaccine Taskforce, Kate Bingham, claimed she was optimistic over the chances of a vaccine being developed by the UK's candidates. She said: ""I am optimistic that we will see something – four of our six vaccines are now in phase three studies, and in each of them we’ve seen very positive data in the phase one and two clinical studies, which shows that people who have received the vaccine do elicit a strong immune response, and that, and if you take the neutralising antibodies that are triggered those antibodies are able to kill live Covid virus. ""So that is very positive and it’s as good as it can be at the moment. ""And we now need to see whether or not those immune responses that we see translate into protection."" This comes as 26,688 people tested positive for the virus in the UK across all settings - the total now stands at 789,229. There were also 191 deaths reported today."	true
7273a6ce	Letter to the Editor of The Washington Post by Mr. Dmitry Polyanskiy, First Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the UN, with regard to the article entitled “A dispatch from the fight against Russian disinformation – and a place where truth is winning” Dear Mr. Baron, I have to address you with regard to the article entitled “A dispatch from the fight against Russian disinformation – and a place where truth is winning” by Mr. Philip Bump, published in “The Washington Post” on 25 July 2018, which mentions me personally in the context of a very sensible topic for us – investigation of 2014 Malaysia Airlines MH17 crash in Ukraine. I would like to stress that I am writing this letter in my personal capacity and I am not directly involved in relevant investigative efforts on our side. But even the information that is available in open sources which could be traced by any researcher allows me to make the conclusions that I make. I would not conceal that I was very much disappointed by this publication which clearly does not meet the standards of an unbiased journalist report. Its main message is to illustrate alleged “Russian efforts to undercut findings” of “independent investigators” and “propaganda efforts of Russian government” in general. Needless to say that the article proceeds from the assumption that Russia was behind the downing of MH17 and all our efforts are aimed just at covering up the culprits. I completely disagree with such a narrative and want to clarify several key points in this regard. Since the very beginning Russia was and continues to be genuinely interested in discovering the truth about this tragic event. We supported all the efforts to conduct full and transparent investigation, we exercised our influence on Donbass rebels who, despite very difficult combat situation caused by the Ukrainian authorities’ obsession to punish their own citizens by military force for their desire to preserve their language and culture, provided unhindered and full access to the crash site. All those who wanted to visit it had the opportunity to do so. Every material evidence was also gathered and transported to the Netherlands for the needs of investigation. We from our side provided a lot of information and material to the investigation team, in particular primary radar data. Upon its request Russia disclosed classified information on Buk missiles 9M38 and 9M38M1. Our producer of this ammunition “Almaz-Antey” also modeled the incident and widely shared technical data and the conclusions of this simulation. The Dutch side is also aware of a lot of witness accounts of people living in this area. We expressed and continue to express our readiness to join the group of investigators. Nevertheless, the Dutch investigators since the very beginning showed particular distrust to our findings and contribution. Russian experts were excluded from their work. Much of the data that we provided was ignored and disregarded in the reports. The trend was very clear – to ignore everything that exposed Ukrainian responsibility for the downing of MH17 and to encourage every claim, be it undocumented or even absurd, that Russia or “Russian-backed rebels” were behind it. It is enough to indicate that the investigators do not press the US to provide satellite data from the day and the site of the crush Americans publicly confirmed that they possess such data, but it is “classified” and accept the refusal of Ukraine to provide primary radar data under laughable pretext. Refusal of Ukrainian authorities to close the airspace over the Eastern part of the country at the day of the crash despite ongoing military operation of Ukrainian forces there which is hard to explain by any logic is also disregarded. In the absence of any trustworthy proofs that “Russians did it” the Dutch investigators started to rely more and more on social media and on the findings of investigator groups like Bellingcat which is in the center of the article. To us the whole idea to use social media accounts as a proof in any investigation is extremely bizarre and doubtful. In our days it is not a problem any more to fake any video or photo with easily available software. We also have a lot of reasons not to trust particularly Bellingcat which was repeatedly caught red-handed by Internet users by voicing anti-Russian or anti-Syrian allegations based on fakes. And these fakes are largely exposed in the Web. Internet users have a lot of questions about Bellingcat financing, important American and Western funds that traditionally support anti-Russian campaigns are said to be the main sponsors of these “investigators”, which casts obvious doubt on their impartiality. Besides, there are a lot of other Internet social-media investigators on the Web who claim things opposite to the “findings” of Bellingcat that clearly indicate that Ukraine is behind the downing of MH17. Why are they ignored while Bellingcat accounts are praised and unquestioned? I personally tried to engage with Bellingcat through my Twitter account @dpol_un. But the moment I doubted their impartiality and illustrated upon their request that they produce fakes I faced a vicious verbal attack from them, including their founder Elliot Higgins who, as was claimed in the article “earned international attention for his exhaustive – and accurate – analysis...”. First of all, they said that I do not exist and called me “Kremlin bot” – a usual tactics for those who disrespect the opinion of the others on the Web. I have to say that this “journalist hero” of yours disappointed me most of all sending personal insults through Twitter. I enclose some of the snapshots for your reference. After the bellingcats, their trolls and bots continued to insult me, I had to blacklist some of them, including Higgins. Of course, no apologies followed up to today which is very illustrative of quality of their “work”. How can “responsible investigators” behave like this? There are hundreds of Internet users who already exposed their lies and all the bellingcats do is attack and bully these users. They just do not have other arguments besides insults and pathetic lies. I believe that the fact that you praise their efforts and close the eyes on all the numerous substantiated claims that they produce fakes is not becoming to the reputation of your distinguished paper. Nor it gives any credit to the Dutch investigators. But let’s put aside the bellingcats, let their conscience judge them, they obviously do not deserve so much attention. What worries me most of all is that after four years of the MH17 tragic accident we are still very far from establishing the truth. Unfortunately, the recent push of the Joint Investigation Team to hold Russia responsible on the basis of bellingcats’ findings, inconclusive and missing data from Ukraine and US and with total disregard of our data and documents is another step in this totally wrong direction. And the attempts to exploit the feelings of the relatives of the victims, mobilize them in support of these unsubstantiated claims are absolutely immoral. My country remains ready to join international investigative efforts to find the truth about MH17 crash. We are also consistently supporting the efforts to find those responsible of this crime and bring them to justice. Russia must be part of the investigation team and not its object – nobody has cancelled the presumption of innocence principle. What we do not accept are ultimatums and fakes. Given the fact that my name was quoted in the abovementioned article in a very dubious context I respectfully ask you to publish my letter in your newspaper. I will also make it open and publish it on the website of our Permanent Mission. Sincerely yours, Dmitry Polyanskiy First Deputy Permanent Representative	Ives vs. Rauner: It's on.	false
8fba8857	In a scenario straight out of “The Twilight Zone,” a group of NASA scientists working on an experiment in Antarctica have detected evidence of a parallel universe — where the rules of physics are the opposite of our own, according to a report. The concept of a parallel universe has been around since the early 1960s, mostly in the minds of fans of sci-fi TV shows and comics, but now a cosmic ray detection experiment has found particles that could be from a parallel realm that also was born in the Big Bang, the Daily Star reported. The experts used a giant balloon to carry NASA’s Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna, or ANITA, high above Antarctica, where the frigid, dry air provided the perfect environment with little to no radio noise to distort its findings. A constant “wind” of high-energy particles constantly arrives on Earth from outer space. Low-energy, subatomic neutrinos with a mass close to zero can pass completely through Earth, but higher-energy objects are stopped by the solid matter of our planet, according to the report. ANITA Antarctic Hang TestUniversity of Hawai'i at Manoa; That means the high-energy particles can only be detected coming “down” from space, but the team’s ANITA detected heavier particles, so-called tau neutrinos, which come “up” out of the Earth. The finding implies that these particles are actually traveling backward in time, suggesting evidence of a parallel universe, according to the Daily Star. Principal ANITA investigator Peter Gorham, an experimental particle physicist at the University of Hawaii, suggested that the only way the tau neutrino could behave that way is if it changed into a different type of particle before passing through the Earth and then back again. Gorham, lead author on a Cornell University paper describing the odd phenomenon, noted that he and his fellow researchers had seen several of these “impossible events,” which some were skeptical about. “Not everyone was comfortable with the hypothesis,” he told New Scientist. The simplest explanation for the phenomenon is that at the moment of the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, two universes were formed — ours and one that from our perspective is running in reverse with time going backward. Of course, if there are any inhabitants of a possible parallel universe, they’d consider us the backward ones. “We’re left with the most exciting or most boring possibilities,” said Ibrahim Safa, who also worked on the experiment.

20968b72	Energy Secretary Rick Perry says he does not believe CO2 emissions from human activity are the primary driver of climate change. That view is at odds with the conclusions of the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt also told CNBC in March he does not believe global warming is primarily caused by CO2. Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CNBC on Monday he does not believe carbon dioxide emissions from human activity are the main driver of climate change, joining the EPA administrator in casting doubt on the conclusion of some of the government’s WB_wombat_top scientists. Asked whether CO2 emissions are primarily responsible for climate change, Perry told CNBC’s “Squawk Box”: “No, most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.” “The fact is this shouldn’t be a debate about, ‘Is the climate changing, is man having an effect on it?’ Yeah, we are. The question should be just how much, and what are the policy changes that we need to make to effect that?” he said. In March, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt told “Squawk Box” he does not believe carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to global warming. Those statements contradict the public stance of the Environmental Protection Agency, at least until recently. Sec. Perry: Bringing back nuclear energy The EPA’s webpage on the causes of climate change used to state, “Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change.” The EPA recently took down the web page containing that statement. Perry and Pruitt’s views are also at odds with the conclusion of NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Despite those conclusions, Perry said, “This idea that science is just absolutely settled and if you don’t believe it’s settled then somehow you’re another neanderthal, that is so inappropriate from my perspective.” Being a skeptic about climate change issues is “quite all right,” he said, suggesting that skepticism is a sign of a “wise, intellectually engaged person.” President Donald Trump announced this month he would pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, an international effort to mitigate the effects of global warming. Since then, most of the president’s surrogates have declined to say whether he believes in climate change. The Trump administration has proposed slashing the Department of Energy’s funding. The Energy Department is shutting down the Office of International Climate and Technology, which works with other countries to develop clean energy technology, The New York Times reported last week. Under Trump, the United States has also backed away from a pledge to double research and development spending on energy technology to $6.4 billion by 2021.

On June 8, voters will have the opportunity to judge her on her record. We all know that Sturgeon’s only priority is a second independence referendum. Every single SNP MP elected has that same priority – they will go to ­Westminster to campaign for ­independence, not to stand up for Scotland. (Image: 2017 Getty Images) And while Sturgeon and her MPs take their eye off the ball, the public services the SNP are in charge of here in Scotland are neglected. Here’s the truth behind the SNP spin. NHS Scotland’s health boards could face a £1billion cuts ­bombshell under the SNP Government and local services across Scotland are under threat. As health secretary, Sturgeon cut nurse training places – calling it a “sensible way forward”. Scotland now has more than 2500 vacancies for nurses and midwives. (Image: David Cheskin/PA Wire) Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon 8 Cancel Play now The number of consultant posts left unfilled for more than six months has increased by a ­staggering 474 per cent under the SNP and there are now almost 400 consultant vacancies in Scotland. But Labour’s plan to invest in public services in England will result in a massive boost for Scotland’s budget. EDUCATION Under the SNP, teacher numbers have declined by 4000, there are 1000 fewer support staff and ­Scotland’s performance in ­international assessments of maths, science and reading is declining. Meanwhile, the gap in educational attainment separating children from richer and poorer ­backgrounds remains as stubborn as ever. In 2007, the SNP ran on a key manifesto promise to abolish student debt, which they have broken. Instead, student debt has soared. But Labour’s education policies in England will result in a major spending boost for Scotland. (Image: PA/Getty) POLICE Since the SNP’s shambolic ­centralisation of Police Scotland, policing has lurched from one crisis to another. Audit Scotland have highlighted a black hole at the heart of Police Scotland’s budget. The number of full-time police officers has fallen over the past year, while the SNP’s failure to fully fund their promise of 1000 extra officers has resulted in frontline officers having to fill back-office functions rather than being out on the beat. Under a Labour ­government, Scotland will receive £70million which we can use to ensure officers can focus on policing and protecting our communities. TRANSPORT (Image: Getty) Major road-building projects have been delayed, bus services are ­deteriorating and satisfaction with ScotRail is at a 14-year low. Instead of listening to Labour and creating a publicly owned rail service, the SNP handed the ScotRail franchise to the Dutch state ­operator Abellio. This has led to passengers suffering delays, cancellations, ­overcrowding and fare increases. Labour will always protect pensioners’ free bus pass from the age of 60. The truth is that nobody can trust a word of the SNP manifesto that Sturgeon will unveil today. Voters who want to send her a message to drop plans for a divisive second independence referendum and focus on running our schools and hospitals need to vote Labour on June 8.

99fc8e17	by Sen. Doug Whitsett More than a dozen bills relating to firearms were introduced during the recently concluded 77th Legislative Assembly. Most of those bills would have, in some way, impinged upon our second amendment right to own and bear firearms. A few of the more aggressive bills included: • House Bill 3200 that would have created the crime of unlawful possession or transfer of an assault weapon or large capacity magazine, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, or both. • House Bill 3413 that would have created the crime of endangering a minor, by allowing the minor access to a fire arm, punishable by up to one year in prison, a fine of up to $6,250, or both. • SB 347 that would have allowed each school district to establish their own rules regarding the right to carry a licensed concealed weapon on school property. Violation of the law would have constituted criminal trespass, resulting in penalties of up to one year in prison, a fine of up to $6,250, or both. This bill would also have preempted the current law that only allows the legislative body to create laws regulating firearms. • SB 699 that would have restricted the right to carry a concealed weapon in the capitol building by most licensed people without the written permission of the legislative administration. • SB 700 that would have required completion of a background check, before any firearm could be transferred between private parties. Failure to complete the background check could have resulted in penalties up to 5 years in prison, fines up to $125,000, or both. • SB 758 that would have required the owner of a firearm to carry specific liability insurance on each firearm in their possession. It also made it a crime to transfer a firearm to another person unless that individual carried liability insurance on the weapon. Failure to maintain liability insurance on each firearm would have resulted in fines of up to $10,000 per firearm. • SB 796 that would have required completion of a concealed handgun course, including a live fire test, before a concealed handgun license could be issued. It is unclear why our legislature should focus its attention on increasing the requirements to obtain a concealed carry permit. It seems that no one can remember the last time that an Oregon handgun licensee committed a crime with a firearm. Each of these bills, except HB 3413, had an emergency clause attached. The only reason for the emergency clause would have been to prevent the bill from being referred to the people to decide. None of these bills were enacted into Oregon law. The primary reason that the bills did not pass was because the Senate Leadership knew that the combined 15 no votes of 14 Senate Republicans, and of Senator Betsy Johnson, would have defeated each of the bills on the Senate floor. For that reason, they were never allowed to come to the Senate floor for a vote. From my perspective, that vote count is much too close for comfort. Your Legislative Assembly was within one vote of enacting each of those bills into Oregon law. It was within one vote of grossly impinging on our second amendment rights. Unfortunately, too many people are simply unaware of the facts regarding the possession of guns, and the commission of gun related crimes. In fact, most families have been convinced by media reports that gun related crimes are on the increase in America. That simply is not true! Over the past twenty years, the number of homicides committed with a firearm in the United States has decreased by nearly 40 percent. The number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm has also plummeted, declining by nearly 70 percent. Unintended deaths by firearms have dropped by nearly 60 percent since 1993, and have decreased by more than 80 percent since 1929. This dramatic decline in the number of crimes committed with firearms has occurred during the same time period when our national population has increased from 250 million to 315 million people. During the same twenty years, more than 100 million guns have been sold to private citizens in the United States. Forty three percent of U.S homes now report that they possess one or more firearms. I would imagine that the gun owning percentage is actually much higher than reported, because many people who own firearms do not prefer to let anyone know that they have those weapons. All indicators point to the fact that our society becomes safer as more responsible families own guns. Nonetheless, gun violence is the third most often reported event by our news media. That rate of reporting is only surpassed by news reports on traffic and the weather. The media almost never reports the daily events where violence is prevented by an armed citizen. It is this constant media bias that is primarily responsible for people believing that gun violence is on the increase. In my opinion, our most important right, as citizens of the United States, is our constitutionally guaranteed Second Amendment right to own and bear firearms. Throughout recorded history, each and every would-be dictator and despot has first convinced the people to disarm, allegedly in order to make their society a safer and more peaceful place to live. Once they have given up their firearms they have been systematically stripped of all other human rights. We must not allow glib-speaking politicians, and a complicit news media, to convince us that we are safer without firearms. We are not safer. We are defenseless.

7d021245	"The phone number to report Iowa caucus results was posted on a fringe internet message board on Monday night along with encouragement to “clog the lines,” an indication that jammed phone lines that left some caucus managers on hold for hours may have in part been due to prank calls. An Iowa Democratic Party official said the influx of calls to the reporting hotline included “supporters of President Trump who called to express their displeasure with the Democratic Party.” The party official’s comments were first reported late Wednesday by Bloomberg News. Users on a politics-focused section of the fringe 4chan message board repeatedly posted the phone number for the Iowa Democratic Party, which was found by a simple Google search, both as screenshots and in plain text, alongside instructions. ""They have to call in the results now. Very long hold times being reported. Phone line being clogged,"" one user posted at about 11 p.m. ET on Monday, three hours after the caucuses began. ""Uh oh how unfortunate it would be for a bunch of mischief makers to start clogging the lines,"" responded another anonymous user, sarcastically. Some users chimed in, posting alleged wait times on hold, imploring others to “clog the lines [and] make the call lads.” Rob Sand, state auditor of Iowa, said he took results calls on Monday night as a volunteer and received an influx of calls that appeared to have been generated by a post on the internet. “A lot of calls came in at a certain point where it was clear somebody had published the hotline number somewhere,” Sand said. He cautioned that he could not speak for other people who were taking calls and said he did not get any calls that said they were from Trump supporters. He added that the system prevented people from reporting fake results. He also said he was able to identify fake calls quickly. “If I picked up the phone and it was clear after the first handful of words that someone was not calling to report the results, I just hung up,” Sand said. Mandy McClure, communications director for the Iowa Democratic Party, confirmed that the hotline received “an unusually high volume of inbound phone calls to its caucus hotline, including supporters of President Trump.” “The unexplained, and at times hostile, calls contributed to the delay in the Iowa Democratic Party’s collection of results, but in no way affected the integrity of information gathered or the accuracy of data sets reported,” McClure said in a statement. The telephone reporting problems added to other issues, notably a smartphone app that did not work for some people and that also had a coding problem that prevented results from being reported properly, pushing more caucus volunteers to the phone lines. Iowa Democratic Party officials said that party staff members and volunteers flagged and subsequently blocked repeat callers who appeared to be reaching out in an attempt to interfere with their reporting duties. These included callers who would hang up immediately after being connected and callers who expressed support for Trump and displeasure with the Democratic Party. It’s unclear how many prank calls the party received or how much they contributed to wait times. Some calls came from Iowans looking to confirm details of their evening’s caucus, party officials said. The party has not responded to requests for information on how many individuals were manning the phone lines on Monday night. The Trump campaign denied any affiliation with people clogging phone lines on Monday night. “We don’t know anything about this, but perhaps Democrats should consider using an app that works,"" communications director Tim Murtaugh said. ""It's laughable that they would try to blame Trump for their own incompetence."" Several officials at caucuses attended by NBC News reporters struggled with lengthy hold times that made it impossible for them to report results. 4chan, which hosts an anonymous and often extremist politics board called /pol/ whose users have largely supported Trump since 2015, is known for extensive online political trolling and targeted harassment campaigns. On debate nights, 4chan users often direct one another to swarm and manipulate specific online polls on other websites with repeat votes, a practice known as “brigading” in online communities. The polls would then be used by politicians and partisan websites to claim shocking upsets. Users on 4chan are anonymous, and usernames are randomly generated with each new thread. Some users on 4chan pushed back against users claiming to spam phone lines on Monday night. One user said he didn’t want other trolls “making us the scapegoat for the DNC.” “I can’t wait for the news headlines saying nefarious trolls ruined the caucus,” another added. Two precinct chairs said they were unaware of any interference with the hotline and doubted it made much of an impact. “I wouldn’t blame the Republicans,” said Tom Courtney, co-chair of the Des Moines County Democratic Party and a precinct chair. “I’d love to blame the Republicans and the Trumpers, but I don’t know.” Mike Carberry, chair for a precinct in Iowa City, also said he doubted prank calls were the primary reason for long wait times. “I’m sure that they got some calls, but those could be sorted through relatively quickly,” he said. Another hotline staffer who asked to remain anonymous said they were aware of the prank calls but that they were not the main reason that results were delayed. “It was definitely a problem,” the staffer said. “But it was definitely not the reason that results were a mess.”"	Clog the lines': Internet trolls deliberately disrupted the Iowa caucuses hotline for reporting results	other
bf9f2cd6	Tony Abbott: Daring To Doubt 2017 Annual GWPF Lecture The Honourable Tony Abbott MP Former Prime Minister of Australia ‘Daring To Doubt’ London, 9 October 2017 Thank you for giving me the same platform that you’ve previously given to fellow Australians John Howard and George Pell. I will strive to be worthy of their example and their friendship; to offer a common sense way through the climate conflict; and, also, to place this particular issue in the broader struggle for practical wisdom now taking place across the Western world. It would be wrong to underestimate the strengths of the contemporary West. By objective standards, people have never had better lives. Yet our phenomenal wealth and our scientific and technological achievements rest on values and principles that have rarely been more widely challenged. To a greater or lesser extent, in most Western countries, we can’t keep our borders secure; we can’t keep our industries intact; and we can’t preserve a moral order once taken for granted. Eventually, something will crystalize out of this age of disruption but in the meantime we could be entering a period of national and even civilizational decline. In Australia, we’ve had ten years of disappointing government. It’s not just the churn of prime ministers that now rivals Italy’s, the internal divisions and the policy confusion that followed a quarter century of strong government under Bob Hawke and John Howard. It’s the institutional malaise. We have the world’s most powerful upper house: a Senate where good government can almost never secure a majority. Our businesses campaign for same sex marriage but not for economic reform. Our biggest company, BHP, the world’s premier miner, lives off the coal industry that it now wants to disown. And our oldest university, Sydney, now boasts that its mission is “unlearning”. Of course, to be an Australian is still to have won the lottery of life, and there’s yet no better place to live and work. But there’s a nagging sense that we’re letting ourselves down and failing to reach anything like our full potential. We are not alone in this. The Trump ascendancy, however it works out, was a popular revolt against politics-as-usual. Brexit was a rejection of the British as well as of the European establishments. Yes, the centrist, Macron, won in France but only by sidelining the parties that had ruled from the start of the Fifth Republic. And while the German chancellor was re-elected, seemingly it’s at the head of an unstable coalition after losing a quarter of her vote. Everywhere, there’s a breakdown of public trust between voters and their leaders for misdiagnosing problems, for making excuses about who’s to blame, and for denying the damage that’s been done. Since the Global Financial Crisis, at least in the West, growth has been slow, wages stagnant, opportunities limited, and economic and cultural disruption unprecedented. Within countries and between them, old pecking orders are changing. Civilizational self-doubt is everywhere; we believe in everyone but ourselves; and everything is taken seriously except that which used to be. Just a few years ago, history was supposed to have ended in the triumph of the Western liberal order. Yet far from becoming universal, Western values are less and less accepted even in the West itself. We still more or less accept that every human being is born with innate dignity; with rights, certainly, but we’re less sure about the corresponding duties. We still accept the golden rule of human conduct: to treat others as we would have them treat us – or to use the Gospel formula to “love your neighbour as you love yourself” – but we’re running on empty. In Britain and Australia, scarcely 50 per cent describe themselves as Christian, down from 90 per cent a generation back. For decades, we’ve been losing our religious faith but we’re fast losing our religious knowledge too. We’re less a post-Christian society than a non-Christian, or even an anti-Christian one. It hasn’t left us less susceptible to dogma, though, because we still need things to believe in and causes to fight for; it’s just that believers can now be found for almost anything and everything. Climate change is by no means the sole or even the most significant symptom of the changing interests and values of the West. Still, only societies with high levels of cultural amnesia – that have forgotten the scriptures about man created “in the image and likeness of God” and charged with “subduing the earth and all its creatures” – could have made such a religion out of it. There’s no certain way to regain cultural self-confidence. The heart of any recovery, though, has to be an honest facing of facts and an insistence upon intellectual rigour. More than ever, the challenge of leadership is to say what you mean and do what you say. The lesson I’ve taken from being in government, and then out of it, is simply to speak my mind. The risk, when people know where you stand, is losing their support. The certainty, when people don’t know where you stand, is losing their respect. Of course, we’re all nostalgic for the days when governments and oppositions could agree on the big issues; but pleading for bi-partisanship won’t create it. As my government showed on border protection policy, the only way to create a new consensus is to argue the case, to make a decision, and then to let the subsequent facts speak for themselves. The modern world, after all, is not the product of a successful search for consensus. It’s what’s emerged from centuries of critical enquiry and hard clash. Without the constant curiosity and endless questioning that has driven our scientists and engineers, and the constant striving for improvement that’s long guided our planners and policy makers, there’d be no cures for disease, no labour-saving appliances, no sanitation, no urban improvement, no votes for women, no respect for minorities; in other words, no modern world. That may not actually bother some green activists whose ideal is an Amish existence, only without reference to God. But it should bother anyone and everyone who wants longer, safer, more comfortable and more prosperous lives. Beware the pronouncement, “the science is settled”. It’s the spirit of the Inquisition, the thought-police down the ages. Almost as bad is the claim that “99 per cent of scientists believe” as if scientific truth is determined by votes rather than facts. There are laws of physics; there are objective facts; there are moral and ethical truths. But there is almost nothing important where no further enquiry is needed. What the “science is settled” brigade want is to close down investigation by equating questioning with superstition. It’s an aspect of the wider weakening of the Western mind which poses such dangers to the world’s future. Physics suggests, all other things being equal, that an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide would indeed warm the planet. Even so, the atmosphere is an almost infinitely complex mechanism that’s far from fully understood. Palaeontology indicates that over millions of years there have been warmer periods and cooler periods that don’t correlate with carbon dioxide concentrations. The Jurassic warm period and the ice ages occurred without any human contribution at all. The medieval warm period when crops were grown in Greenland and the mini-ice age when the Thames froze over occurred well before industrial activities added to atmospheric carbon dioxide. Prudence and respect for the planet would suggest taking care not lightly to increase carbon dioxide emissions; but the evidence suggests that other factors such as sun spot cycles and oscillations in the Earth’s orbit are at least as important for climate change as this trace gas – which, far from being pollution, is actually essential for life to exist. Certainly, no big change has accompanied the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration over the past century from roughly 300 to roughly 400 parts per million or from 0.03 to 0.04 per cent. Contrary to the breathless assertions that climate change is behind every weather event, in Australia, the floods are not bigger, the bushfires are not worse, the droughts are not deeper or longer, and the cyclones are not more severe than they were in the 1800s. Sometimes, they do more damage but that’s because there’s more to destroy, not because their intensity has increased. More than 100 years of photography at Manly Beach in my electorate does not suggest that sea levels have risen despite frequent reports from climate alarmists that this is imminent. It may be that a tipping point will be reached soon and that the world might start to warm rapidly but so far reality has stubbornly refused to conform to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s computer modelling. Even the high-priests of climate change now seem to concede that there was a pause in warming between the 1990s and 2014. So far, though, there’s no concession that their models might require revision even though unadjusted data suggests that the 1930s were actually the warmest decade in the United States and that temperatures in Australia have only increased by 0.3 degrees over the past century, not the 1 degree usually claimed. The growing evidence that records have been adjusted, that the impact of urban heat islands has been downplayed, and that data sets have been slanted in order to fit the theory of dangerous anthropogenic global warming does not make it false; but it should produce much caution about basing drastic action upon it. Then there’s the evidence that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide (which is a plant food after all) are actually greening the planet and helping to lift agricultural yields. In most countries, far more people die in cold snaps than in heat waves, so a gradual lift in global temperatures, especially if it’s accompanied by more prosperity and more capacity to adapt to change, might even be beneficial. In what might be described as Ridley’s paradox, after the distinguished British commentator: at least so far, it’s climate change policy that’s doing harm; climate change itself is probably doing good; or at least, more good than harm. Australia, for instance, has the world’s largest readily available supplies of coal, gas and uranium, yet thanks to a decade of policy based more on green ideology than common sense, we can’t be sure of keeping the lights on this summer; and, in the policy-induced shift from having the world’s lowest power prices to amongst the highest, our manufacturing industry has lost its one, big comparative economic advantage. About 20 years ago, in Australia, limiting carbon dioxide emissions first became a goal of public policy. It was the Howard government, back in 1997, that originally introduced the Renewable Energy Target, a stealth carbon tax, requiring energy suppliers to source a percentage of their power from new renewable generation. But in those far off days, it was just 2 per cent. During the energy discussions around the Howard cabinet table, I recall thinking “why not encourage more solar hot water systems to reduce power use” and “why not incentivise the installation of solar panels to help power people’s homes”? Way back in the 1980s, in my final provost’s collection at The Queen’s College, Lord Blake had observed: “Mr Abbott needs to temper his robust common sense with a certain philosophic doubt”. If only more of us had realised sooner how easy it was with renewable power to have too much of a good thing! Unsurprisingly, a conservative cabinet did indeed respond to farmers’ worries about the drought then gripping eastern Australia; and the public’s then eagerness to support environmental gestures with other people’s money. We thought we could reduce emissions, or at least limit their increase, without much disruption to everyday life, hence these gestures to the zeitgeist. Where the subsidy was modest and the impact on the power system minimal, our thinking ran, why not accommodate the feel-good urge to be “responsible global citizens”? In its last few months, the Howard government even agreed in-principle to support an emissions trading scheme. But Howard was shrewd enough to know how the most important consequences of any policy were often the unintended ones. His government’s refusal to ratify the Kyoto climate change treaty, even though we’d secured a good deal for Australia, showed his caution about the impact of emissions reduction on power prices and the wider economy. For the incoming Labor Prime Minister after 2007, though, climate change was nothing less than the “greatest moral challenge of our time”. The Rudd-Gillard government believed in an emissions trading scheme, no ifs, no buts, and in a ten-fold increase in the mandatory use of renewables. For a while, the Liberal-National opposition was inclined to go along with it. My own leaning for the first year or so was not to oppose it; but my doubts about the theory of climate change were growing and my sense that an ETS would turn out to be a “great big new tax on everything” was hardening. To a party audience in country Victoria in October 2009, I observed that the so-called settled science of climate change was “absolute crap”; and after winning the opposition leadership had a secret party room ballot to oppose an ETS because it was not our job to enter into weak compromises with a bad government. As it happened, the 2010 election was more about power prices than about saving the planet. Under great political pressure, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard, declared “there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead”. But early in 2011, as part of her minority government’s deal with the Greens, she committed to a carbon tax that would put wholesale power prices up by 40 per cent. The 2013 election was a referendum on Labor’s carbon tax – as well as Labor’s complete loss of control over our maritime borders – with a thumping win to the Liberal-National Coalition. In July 2014, the Abbott government abolished the carbon tax, saving the average household about $500 a year. In early 2015, we reduced the Renewable Energy Target from 28 to 23 per cent. It wasn’t enough, but it was the best that we could get through the Senate. My cabinet always had some ministers focussed on jobs and cost of living; and others more concerned with emissions reduction, even though our contribution to global emissions was barely one per cent. Inevitably, our Paris agreement to a 26 to 28 per cent emissions reduction was a compromise based on the advice that we could achieve it largely through efficiencies, without additional environmental imposts, using the highly successful emissions reduction fund; because, as I said at the time, “the last thing we want to do is strengthen the environment (but) damage our economy”. At last year’s election, the government chose not to campaign on power prices even though Labor was promising a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target (requiring a $50 billion over-build of wind farms) and a 45 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 (requiring a new carbon tax). After a net gain of 25 seats at the previous two elections, when we had campaigned on power prices, we had a net loss of 14 when we didn’t. And subsequent events have made the politics of power once more the central battleground between and within the two main parties. Although manufacturing, agriculture and transport are also large carbon dioxide emitters, the politics of emissions reduction has always focussed on power generation because shifting to renewables has always been more saleable to voters than closing down industry, giving up cars and not eating beef. As a badge of environmental virtue, the South Australian state Labor government had been boasting that, on average, almost 50 per cent of its power was wind-generated – although at any moment it could vary from almost zero to almost 100 per cent. It had even ostentatiously blown up its one coal-fired power station. In September last year, though, the wind blew so hard that the turbines had to shut down – and the inter-connector with Victoria and its reliable coal-fired power failed too. For 24 hours, there was a state wide blackout. For nearly two million people, the lights were off, cash registers didn’t work, traffic lights went down, lifts stopped, and patients were sent home from hospitals. Throughout last summer, there were further blackouts and brownouts across eastern Australia requiring hundreds of millions in repairs to the plant of energy-intensive industries. Despite this, in a display of virtue signalling, to flaunt its environmental credentials (and to boost prices for its other coal-fired plants), last March the French-government part-owned multinational, Engie, closed down the giant Hazelwood coal-fired station that had supplied a quarter of Victoria’s power. The Australian Energy Market Operator is now sufficiently alarmed to have just issued an official warning of further blackouts this summer in Victoria and South Australia and severe medium term power shortfalls. But in yet more virtue-signalling, energy giant AGL is still threatening to close the massive Liddell coal-fired power station in NSW and replace it with a subsidised solar farm and a much smaller gas-fired power station relying on gas supplies that don’t currently exist. Were it not rational behaviour based on irrational government policy, this deliberate elimination of an essential service could only be described as a form of economic self-harm. Hydro aside, renewable energy should properly be referred to as intermittent and unreliable power. When the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine, the power doesn’t flow. Wind and solar power are like sailing ships; cheaper than powered boats, to be sure, but we’ve stopped using sail for transport because it couldn’t be trusted to turn up on time. Because the weather is unpredictable, you never really know when renewable power is going to work. Its marginal cost is low but so is its reliability, so in the absence of industrial scale batteries, it always needs matching capacity from dependable coal, gas, hydro, or nuclear energy. This should always have been obvious. Also now apparent is the system instability and the perverse economics that subsidised renewables on a large scale have injected into our power supply. Not only is demand variable but there’s a vast and unpredictable difference between potential and dispatch-able capacity at any one time. Having to turn coal fired power stations up or down as the wind changes makes them much less profitable even though coal remains by far the cheapest source of reliable power. A market that’s driven by subsidies rather than by economics always fails. Subsidy begets subsidy until the system collapses into absurdity. In Australia’s case, having subsidised renewables, allegedly to save the planet; we’re now faced with subsidising coal, just to keep the lights on. We have got ourselves into this mess because successive federal governments have tried to reduce emissions rather than to ensure reliable and affordable power; because, rather than give farmers a fairer return, state governments have given in to green lobbyists and banned or heavily restricted gas exploration and extraction; and because shareholder activists have scared power companies out of new investment in fossil fuel power generation, even though you can’t run a modern economy without it. In the short term, to avoid blackouts, we have to get mothballed or under-utilised gas back into the system. In the medium term, there must be – first – no subsidies, none, for new intermittent power (and a freeze on the RET should be no problem if renewables are as economic as the boosters claim); second, given the nervousness of private investors, there must be a government-built coal-fired power station to overcome political risk; third, the gas bans must go; and fourth, the ban on nuclear power must go too in case a dry country ever needs base load power with zero emissions. The government is now suggesting that there might not be a new Clean Energy Target after all. There must not be – and we still need to deal with what’s yet to come under the existing target. In the longer term, we need less theology and more common sense about emissions reduction. It matters but not more than everything else. As Clive James has suggested in a celebrated recent essay, we need to get back to evidence based policy rather than “policy based evidence”. Even if reducing emissions really is necessary to save the planet, our effort, however Herculean, is barely-better-than-futile; because Australia’s total annual emissions are exceeded by just the annual increase in China’s. There’s a veneer of rational calculation to emissions reduction but underneath it’s about “doing the right thing”. Environmentalism has managed to combine a post-socialist instinct for big government with a post-Christian nostalgia for making sacrifices in a good cause. Primitive people once killed goats to appease the volcano gods. We’re more sophisticated now but are still sacrificing our industries and our living standards to the climate gods to little more effect. So far, climate change policy has generated new taxes, new subsidies and new restrictions in rich countries; and new demands for more aid from poor countries. But for the really big emitters, China and India, it’s a first world problem. Between them, they’re building or planning more than 800 new coal-fired power stations – often using Australian coal – with emissions, on average, 30 per cent lower than from our own ageing generators. Unsurprisingly, the recipients of climate change subsidies and climate change research grants think action is very urgent indeed. As for the general public, of course saving the planet counts – until the bills come in and then the humbug detector is switched on. Should Australia close down its steel industry; watch passively while its aluminium industry moves offshore to places less concerned about emissions; export coal, but not use it ourselves; and deliberately increase power prices for people who can’t install their own solar panels and batteries? Of course not, but these are the inevitable consequences of continuing current policies. That’s the reality no one has wanted to face for a long time: that we couldn’t reduce emissions without also hurting the economy; that’s the inconvenient truth that can now no longer be avoided. The only rational choice is to put Australian jobs and Australia’s standard of living first; to get emissions down but only as far as we can without putting prices up. After two decades’ experience of the very modest reality of climate change but the increasingly dire consequences of the policy to deal with it, anything else would be a dereliction of duty as well as a political death wish. I congratulate the Global Warming Policy Foundation for your commitment to rational inquiry; your insistence that the theory must be made to fit the facts, rather than the other way round; your concern to do good, rather than just to seem good; and for the hope I share with you: that, in the end, the best policy will turn out to be the best politics. I’m reminded of the story of a man randomly throwing pieces of paper from the window of a train. Eventually his companion asked him why he did it. It keeps the elephants down, he said. “But there are no elephants here”, his companion replied. “Precisely; it’s a very successful method”. A tendency to fear catastrophe is ingrained in the human psyche. Looking at the climate record over millions of years, one day it will probably come; whatever we do today won’t stop it, and when it comes, it will have little to do with the carbon dioxide emissions of mankind.

9f10a8a9	It was an accurate and judicious answer, so naturally it sent climate alarmists into paroxysms of condemnation. The Washington Post slammed Pruitt as a “denier” driven by “unreason.” Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii called Pruitt’s views “extreme” and “irresponsible” — proof of his unfitness to head the EPA. Gina McCarthy, who ran the agency under President Obama, bewailed the danger global warming poses “to all of us who call Earth home,” and said she couldn’t “imagine what additional information [Pruitt] might want from scientists” in order to understand that. Replied Pruitt: “No. I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So no — I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. But we don’t know that yet. We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.” ‘Do you believe,” CNBC’s Joe Kernen asked Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency’s new director, in an interview last Thursday, “that it’s been proven that CO2 is the primary control knob for climate?” Yet for all the hyperventilating, Pruitt’s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate’s “primary control knob” — was entirely sound. “We don’t know that yet,” he said. We don’t. CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent. Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all. Advertisement There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor, thereby increasing warming through a “positive feedback loop.” But that theory so far is mostly speculative; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed, nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred. It should go without saying that if scientists cannot yet make accurate predictions about future climate change, then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete. Advertisement Earth’s climate system is unfathomably complex. It is affected by innumerable interacting variables, atmospheric CO2 levels being just one. The more variables there are in any system or train of events, the lower the probability of all of them coming to pass. Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2, but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 — i.e., ½ x ½ Extending your winning streak to a third guess is even less probable: just 1 in 8. Apply that approach to climate change, and it becomes clear why the best response to the alarmists’ frantic predictions is a healthy skepticism. The list of variables that shape climate includes cloud formation, topography, altitude, proximity to the equator, plate tectonics, sunspot cycles, volcanic activity, expansion or contraction of sea ice, conversion of land to agriculture, deforestation, reforestation, direction of winds, soil quality, El Niño and La Niña ocean cycles, prevalence of aerosols (airborne soot, dust, and salt) — and, of course, atmospheric greenhouse gases, both natural and manmade. A comprehensive list would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision. Advertisement But for the sake of argument, say there are merely 15 variables involved in predicting global climate change, and assume that climatologists have mastered each one to a near-perfect accuracy of 95 percent. What are the odds that a climate model built on a system that simple would be reliable? Less than 50/50. (Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent.) Is it any surprise that climate-change predictions in the real world — where the complexities are exponentially greater and the exactitude of knowledge much less — have such a poor track record? Pruitt got it right: Measuring human impacts on climate is indeed “very challenging.” The science is far from settled. That is why calls to radically reduce carbon emissions are so irresponsible — and why dire warnings of what will happen if we don’t are little better than reckless fearmongering.

972048cd	Snowflake students at Oxford University are the latest to demand that clapping should be banned because applause noise can trigger anxiety and want 'jazz hands' to be used instead. The idea for a British sign language alternative for clapping involving the waving of hands was put forward at the student union's first meeting of the year on Tuesday. Sabbatical Officers Roisin McCallion, Vice President for Welfare and Equal Opportunity and Ebie Edwards Cole, Chair for Oxford SU Disabilities Campaign, successfully passed the motion to mandate the encouragement of silent clapping. Sabbatical Officers Roisin McCallion (left), Vice President for Welfare and Equal Opportunity and Ebie Edwards Cole (right), Chair for Oxford SU Disabilities Campaign, successfully passed the motion to mandate the encouragement of silent clapping They argued that alternatives to traditional clapping have been in place to aid accessibility in some organisations since 2015. The ban on clapping would be at student union meetings and events where traditional clapping and cheering 'presents an access issue' to those with anxiety disorders. One former student, said: 'Oxford University Student Union is always seeking to be more accommodating for students. Especially for those with accessibility issues. 'But this idea will not work and is completely ludicrous.' The use of jazz hands - where students wave their hands in the air - is the British Sign Language expression for applause and is deemed a more inclusive gesture. The motion, which carried, mandates the encouragement of sign language clapping by Sabbatical Officers at union meetings and events (file photo of students at the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford) It comes after the University of Manchester Students Union passed a motion to do the same thing in September last year. Ms McCallion said: 'The policy was proposed in order to encourage the use of British Sign Language clapping during our democratic events to make those events more accessible and inclusive for all, including people who suffer from anxiety. 'Inclusivity is one of the Students' Union's founding principles.'	A look at Congressman Conor Lamb’s voting record so far	false
53d111d0	The primary school population in England has continued to rise sharply, with 94,000 extra pupils this year, reaching the highest levels since the 1970s. The 2.1% increase in primary numbers is equivalent to six more pupils for every school. Minority ethnic pupils made up 71% of the increase, says the Department for Education's school census report. The annual figures show there are now more super-sized primary schools. It will mean more funding demands to create extra places and pressure on places for families looking for schools. There are now 87 primary schools with more than 800 pupils, up from 77 in 2014 and 58 in 2013. The number of infants in classes above the limit of 30 pupils has increased again - with 100,800 pupils in these over-sized classes, an increase of 8% compared with 2014. The number has more than doubled since 2012, when there were about 47,000 infants in classes of more than 30. In 2008, the figure was fewer than 25,000. Changing demographics The figures from the annual school census show numbers rising across the state school system - up by 2.1% in primary and 0.1% in secondary - to a total of 8.4 million pupils. This is an increase of about 200,000 children in two years. The rising population has been a particular challenge for primary schools, which have been having to expand to absorb the increasing numbers. But this rising population wave has now reached secondary schools. The analysis says that the rise in primary school numbers is particularly driven by rising number of ethnic minority pupils, accounting for more than two-thirds of the increase. In primary schools, 30.4% of pupils are from an ethnic minority, compared with 29.5% the previous year. But there are wide regional variations. In the inner London boroughs, 81% of pupils are from ethnic minorities; while in north-east England, the figure is below 11%. And at council level, in Newham 94% of pupils are from ethnic minorities, while in Durham the figure is below 5%. In inner London, the biggest ethnic group in primary school are black pupils, predominantly from an African background, with Asian pupils the second biggest group. In secondary schools, about 27% of pupils are ethnic minorities, which the report says represents an increase of about 30% in six years. Despite the rising number of pupils there has not been a growth in the number of primary schools, which have been consistently falling since the 1980s. Instead, primary schools have been getting bigger, with more pupils in schools with more than 800 pupils. Primary pupil numbers had been declining until 2009, but they have been rising sharply since. 'Good local school' Funding this demand for extra places - forecast to be another 460,000 during the next five years - has been a continuing pressure on the schools budget. In the general election campaign, the Conservatives committed themselves to protecting per-pupil spending, including for rising numbers. A DfE spokesman said: The average infant class size has remained stable at 27.4 and the number of unlawfully large infant classes has fallen - down 137 compared to 2009 - all despite a small increase in pupil numbers since last year. To help schools respond to rising pupils numbers, the government invested £5bn between 2011 and 2015 to support local authorities - creating almost half a million new places. On top of that, we have committed to invest a further £7bn on new school places over the next six years, to support the new school places needed all the way up to September 2021. The government has also opened over 250 free schools since 2010 and we are committed to creating at least 500 more during this parliament, creating over 400,000 new school places and ensuring even more parents have access to a good local school for their child. Tristram Hunt, Labour's shadow education secretary, said: The growing pressures on primary school class sizes should compel the government to rethink how it is allocating funding for schools. The case is clear. In the early years of primary school, children in classes capped at 30 are more likely to make better progress. It cannot make sense for the government to continue to prioritise money for new free schools in areas with surplus school places when we have more than 100,000 primary pupils being taught in classes of more than 30.		partially false
721fde78	"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Contact: Jennie Kennedy May 13, 2016 Rep. Celia Israel Disappointed in Court Ruling Finding School Finance System Unconstitutional, Calls for Immediate Special Session Austin - Rep. Celia Israel (D-Travis County) is asking Gov. Abbott to call a special session to fully fund public education in light of today's Texas Supreme Court decision upholding the current woefully inadequate school finance system. ""I am extremely disappointed in the ruling today from the Texas Supreme Court. It was especially surprising to see the court label our system 'Byzantine' and 'meeting minimal standards' at the same time."" Israel said. ""Texas deserves better. We cannot continue to crow about our economic growth and continue to act as if a 'Byzantine' system serves our children and our future well. I call upon Governor Abbott to immediately call a Special Session so Texas can fully invest in its education system."" Israel expressed disappointment in the Court's ruling striking down Judge John Dietz's finding lawmakers ignored the real costs of education and the impact of the significant cuts made during the 2011 Session, all the while raising standards for Texas students and requiring schools to provide more elaborate programs. The Court's ruling appears to leave the Legislature as the last word as to whether Texas is fulfilling its constitutional mandate to ""make suitable provision for the support and maintenance of an efficient system of public schools."" When adjusted for inflation, per student spending has remained relatively flat over the past 16 years. Despite that trend, Texas schools in 2017 will receive $381 less per student than they did in 2003. It would take an additional $3.5 billion next biennium just to get our schools where they were 14 years ago. At the same time, state support for public schools continues to fall behind the cost of inflation, does not account for changes in student needs or academic standards, and fails to fund equitably between districts. ""It's time for big ideas and Texas-sized leadership,"" Israel said, noting her constituents will no longer accept the ""business as usual"" approach to education funding, even with the Court's ruling. ""I am confident that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will work together to make a public school system that provides the resources needed for all students to be successful, no matter where they live or what their background.

JW administratively appealed the request on June 5, 2012, and received 222 pages more on March 6, 2013. According to the documents: March 25 – 27, 2012, CRS spent $674.14 upon being “deployed to Sanford, FL, to work marches, demonstrations, and rallies related to the shooting and death of an African-American teen by a neighborhood watch captain.” March 25 – 28, 2012, CRS spent $1,142.84 “in Sanford, FL to work marches, demonstrations, and rallies related to the shooting and death of an African-American teen by a neighborhood watch captain. *March 30 – April 1, 2012, CRS spent $892.55 in Sanford, FL “to provide support for protest deployment in Florida.” * Correction to bulleted point number three: “to provide interregional support for protest deployment in Florida.” Correction required due to unintentional copywriting error.

You did lots of stuff behind the scene to make Miami a success. We will continue to work together.” He signed the email simply Tommy. Carswell responded: “That’s why we make the big bucks.” Set up under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the DOJ’s CRS, the employees of which are required by law to “conduct their activities in confidence,” reportedly has greatly expanded its role under President Barack Obama. Though the agency claims to use “impartial mediation practices and conflict resolution procedures,” press reports along with the documents obtained by Judicial Watch suggest that the unit deployed to Sanford, FL, took an active role in working with those demanding the prosecution of Zimmerman. On April 15, 2012, during the height of the protests, the Orlando Sentinel reported, “They [the CRS] helped set up a meeting between the local NAACP and elected officials that led to the temporary resignation of police Chief Bill Lee according to Turner Clayton, Seminole County chapter president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.” The paper quoted the Rev. Valarie Houston, pastor of Allen Chapel AME Church, a focal point for protestors, as saying “They were there for us,” after a March 20 meeting with CRS agents. Separately, in response to a Florida Sunshine Law request to the City of Sanford, Judicial Watch also obtained an audio recording of a “community meeting” held at Second Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Sanford on April 19, 2012. The meeting, which led to the ouster of Sanford’s Police Chief Bill Lee, was scheduled after a group of college students calling themselves the “Dream Defenders” barricaded the entrance to the police department demanding Lee be fired. According to the Orlando Sentinel, DOJ employees with the CRS had arranged a 40-mile police escort for the students from Daytona Beach to Sanford. “These documents detail the extraordinary intervention by the Justice Department in the pressure campaign leading to the prosecution of George Zimmerman,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “My guess is that most Americans would rightly object to taxpayers paying government employees to help organize racially-charged demonstrations.”	Court's joint enterprise ruling could free Ameen Jogee from jail	partially false

I'm constantly being asked this question: where do they get tanks and heavy artillery? Listen, in many hot spots around the world there are various kinds of conflicts and military campaigns, including with the use of tanks, artillery, and so on. Where does this come from?

92e17268	Western media recently launched a new round of attacks on China's religious freedom. The country's major religious associations on Tuesday proposed an initiative demanding that all religious venues raise China's national flag to strengthen awareness of respect for the flag and preserve the flag's dignity. This move, however, was interpreted by some Western media outlets as an attempt to expand the country's ideological control over religious life. Over two months ago when the China Islamic Association urged mosques in China to fly national flags to promote patriotism among Muslims, the West also accused China of tightening its grip on religion and intervening in religious freedom. A national flag is a symbol of the country that should be respected by all citizens. The display of national flags is not only recognition of national sovereignty, but also a manifestation of love for the country. Hanging a flag at religious sites is meant to enhance the concept of nation and civic consciousness among religious people. Promoting patriotism isn't at odds with protecting freedom of religion, Islam, for instance, emphasizes patriotism as a part of faith. For multi-ethnic and multi-religious countries like China, strengthening people's national and civic consciousness is of particular importance. Colonialists divided national borders according to nationality and religion, which led to serious conflicts to Asian countries, as is the case with India and Pakistan. China must draw lessons from this and ratchet up efforts to build religious people's national and civic consciousness. Religions are exclusive. The key to make them live in harmony is to sustain their national identity. If the shared sense of national identity collapsed, the country would be divided or even lurch toward war. Thanks to China's effective religious governance, religions have developed rapidly in China over the years. The Chinese government adopts the principle of separating religion from politics and respects freedom of religion. Legal religious activities are not only allowed in any region of China, but also well protected. However in an attempt to divide China's national unity, many Western forces have repeatedly made an issue of the country's religious freedom, making groundless claims that religious groups are suppressed in China. When the American flag is raised, all Americans, regardless of race or religion, stand up to show their respect. China has every reason to strengthen national identity and civic consciousness among religious people. Flying the national flag at religious sites is a good way to do so. Without a stable country as the foundation of religious belief, religion will only cause division.

347530a3	"On Tuesday, radio show host John Fredricks stated that multiple voters in Georgia had called into his show to tell him that they were unable to cast their votes in the Georgia runoff election because they were told the voting machines were malfunctioning. The callers claimed the poll workers told them to put their ballots in a box and they would be scanned later in the day. Keep in mind the malfunctions were reportedly in deep red counties. The comments from Fredricks came during an interview with Steve Bannon on War Room Pandemic. ""Dominion machines in... 3 of the largest Republican precincts...are down...They are told they can't scan their ballots because the machines don't work...The pole workers are saying 'When it's fixed we'll scan it for you'...There's all kinds of red flags,"" said Fredricks. More voters on Twitter also sounded the alarm. “Just voted in Newton County Georgia,"" said one Twitter user. ""Heavy republican district.. When I went to place my printed ballot into the dominion machine, the poll worked said the scanner was broken and someone was coming to fix it, I placed it in the machine slot but not in the scanner."" The voter later followed up, tweeting, “UPDATE. I called @GaRepublicans hotline and the guy said they are already hearing about these types of problems!”

Under normal circumstances I would say that is secure. In GA...I would have found a seat until it was repaired and fed the ballot myself."" The situation in Georgia continues to get more bizarre. Last Wednesday, Georgia’s Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Elections as well as members of the Senate Judiciary Committee gathered to hold a hearing on Georgia's election laws. During the hearing, inventor Jovan Pulitzer stated that he could easily audit Georgia's election results with special techniques that would identify fraudulent ballots. Pulitzer explained how he has “no regard for the smoke and mirrors of how the machines work"" and would be solely focusing on the paper ballots. “I don’t care about the machine,"" he explained. ""I don’t even care about the code that was written in the machine. What I care about is that physical artifact [ballot] and that physical artifact has material differences district to district that should not be there.” Pulitzer shockingly claimed he could analyze 500,000 in just two hours.

3c8eac5c	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCTV) - Wednesday, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to express the United States’ intent to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement. The Paris Climate Agreement, signed in 2016, is an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The agreement deals with greenhouse gas emission mitigation, adaptation and finance in an effort to limit global warming. Following this executive order, Florida Senator Rick Scott release the following statement: We all want to take care of our environment and protect it for generations to come, but we have to stop joining deals that are bad for America. President Biden is throwing the U.S. back into the Paris Agreement just to appease his liberal friends. This deal does nothing to hold real polluters, like Communist China and India, accountable and it unfairly puts American taxpayers on the hook. It was bad for America when Obama signed it and it’s still bad now. Pres. Biden additionally canceled the Keystone XL pipeline as well as ordered federal agencies to start the process of reinstating environmental regulations that were reversed under Pres. Trump.

86955ba5	"In my experience, good public policy is best shaped by the dispassionate analysis of what in practice has worked, or not. Policy based on common assumptions and popular sentiments can become a recipe for mistaken prescriptions and misguided interventions. Nowhere is this divorce between rhetoric and reality more evident than in the formulation of global drug policies, where too often emotions and ideology rather than evidence have prevailed. Take the case of the medical use of cannabis. By looking carefully at the evidence from the United States, we now know that legalizing the use of cannabis for medical purposes has not, as opponents argued, led to an increase in its use by teenagers. By contrast, there has been a near tripling of American deaths from heroin overdoses between 2010 and 2013, even though the law and its severe punishments remain unchanged. This year, between April 19 and 21, the United Nations General Assembly will hold a special session on drugs and the world will have a chance to change course. As we approach that event, we need to ask ourselves if we are on the right policy path. More specifically, how do we deal with what the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has called the ""unintended consequences"" of the policies of the last 50 years, which have helped, among other things, to create a vast, international criminal market in drugs that fuels violence, corruption and instability? Just think of the 16,000 murders in Mexico in 2013, many of which are directly linked to drug trafficking. A War on the People Globally, the ""war on drugs"" has not succeeded. Some estimate that enforcing global prohibition costs at least $100 billion (€90.7 billion) a year, but as many as 300 million people now use drugs worldwide, contributing to a global illicit market with a turnover of $330 billion a year, one of the largest commodity markets in the world. Prohibition has had little impact on the supply of or demand for drugs. When law enforcement succeeds in one area, drug production simply moves to another region or country, drug trafficking moves to another route and drug users switch to a different drug. Nor has prohibition significantly reduced use. Studies have consistently failed to establish the existence of a link between the harshness of a country's drug laws and its levels of drug use. The widespread criminalization and punishment of people who use drugs, the over­crowded prisons, mean that the war on drugs is, to a significant degree, a war on drug users ­­ a war on people. Africa is sadly an example of these problems. The West Africa Commission on Drugs, which my foundation convened, reported last year that the region has now become not only a major transit point between producers in Latin America and consumers in Europe, but an area where consumption is increasing. Drug money, and the criminality associated with it, is fostering corruption and violence. The stability of countries and the region as a whole is under threat. I believe that drugs have destroyed many lives, but wrong government policies have destroyed many more. We all want to protect our families from the potential harm of drugs. But if our children do develop a drug problem, surely we will want them cared for as patients in need of treatment and not branded as criminals. Stop Stigmatizing and Start Helping The tendency in many parts of the world to stigmatize and incarcerate drug users has prevented many from seeking medical treatment. In what other areas of public health do we criminalize patients in need of help? Punitive measures have sent many people to prison, where their drug use has worsened. A criminal record for a young person for a minor drug offense can be a far greater threat to their wellbeing than occasional drug use. The original intent of drug policy, according to the UN Convention on Narcotic Drugs, was to protect the ""health and welfare of mankind."" We need to refocus international and national policy on this key objective. This requires us to take four critical steps. First, we must decriminalize personal drug use. The use of drugs is harmful and reducing those harms is a task for the public health system, not the courts. This must be coupled with the strengthening of treatment services, especially in middle and low­ income countries. Second, we need to accept that a drug­-free world is an illusion. We must focus instead on ensuring that drugs cause the least possible harm. Harm reduction measures, such as needle exchange programs, can make a real difference. Germany adopted such measures early on and the level of HIV infections among injecting drug users is close to 5 percent, compared to over 40 percent in some countries which resist this pragmatic approach. Third, we have to look at regulation and public education rather than the total suppression of drugs, which we know will not work. The steps taken successfully to reduce tobacco consumption (a very powerful and damaging addiction) show what can be achieved. It is regulation and education, not the threat of prison, which has cut the number of smokers in many countries. Higher taxes, restrictions on sale and effective anti­-smoking campaigns have delivered the right results. The legal sale of cannabis is a reality that started with California legalizing the sale of cannabis for medical use in 1996. Since then, 22 U.S. states and some European countries have followed suit. Others have gone further still. A voter initiative which gained a majority at the ballot box has caused Colorado to legalize the sale of cannabis for recreational use. Last year, Colorado collected around $135 million in taxes and license fees related to legal cannabis sales. Others have taken less commercial routes. Users of Spain's cannabis social clubs can grow and buy cannabis through small noncommercial organizations. And Canada looks likely to become the first G7 country to regulate the sale of cannabis next year. Legal Regulation Protects Health Initial trends show us that where cannabis has been legalized, there has been no explosion in drug use or drug­ related crime. The size of the black market has been reduced and thousands of young people have been spared criminal records. But a regulated market is not a free market. We need to carefully think through what needs regulating, and what does not. While most cannabis use is occasional, moderate and not associated with significant problems, it is nonetheless precisely because of its potential risks that it needs to be regulated. And therefore, the fourth and final step is to recognize that drugs must be regulated precisely because they are risky. It is time to acknowledge that drugs are infinitely more dangerous if they are left solely in the hands of criminals who have no concerns about health and safety. Legal regulation protects health. Consumers need to be aware of what they are taking and have clear information on health risks and how to minimize them. Governments need to be able to regulate vendors and outlets according to how much harm a drug can cause. The most risky drugs should never be available ""over the counter"" but only via medical prescription for people registered as dependent users, as is already happening in Switzerland. Scientific evidence and our concern for health and human rights must shape drug policy. This means making sure that fewer people die from drug overdoses and that small-­time offenders do not end up in jail where their drug problems get worse. It is time for a smarter, health­-based approach to drug policy. It is time for countries, such as Germany, which have adopted better policies at home, to strongly advocate for policy change abroad. The United Nations General Assembly special session on the world drug problem would be a good place to start."

9a87dc93	My daughter probably wouldn't have survived in a system where bureaucrats stifle innovation and ration care. Today is the first anniversary of the greatest single assault on our freedom in my lifetime: the signing of ObamaCare. As we consider what this law may do to our country, I can't help but reflect on a medical miracle made possible by the American health-care system. It's one that holds special meaning for me. Some years ago, a little girl was born with a serious heart defect: Her aorta and pulmonary artery were reversed. Without immediate intervention, she would not have survived. The infant was rushed to another hospital where a surgeon performed a procedure at 1 a.m. that saved her life. Eight months later, when her heart was the size of a small plum, an incredibly dedicated and skilled team of medical professionals surgically reconstructed it. Twenty-seven years later, the young woman is now a nurse in a neonatal intensive care unit where she is studying to become a nurse practitioner. She wasn't saved by a bureaucrat, and no government mandate forced her parents to purchase the coverage that saved her. Instead, her care was provided under a run-of-the-mill plan available to every employee of an Oshkosh, Wis., plastics plant. If you haven't guessed, this story touches my heart because the girl is my daughter, Carey. And my wife and I are incredibly thankful that we had the freedom to seek out the most advanced surgical technique. The procedure that saved her, and has given her a chance at a full life, was available because America has a free-market system that has advanced medicine at a phenomenal pace.	‘Nigeria still records huge losses from unsafe abortions’	false
8.51E+81	For years, the mainstream media has ignored the problem of voter fraud and belittled those of us who are trying to do something about it. And when secretaries of state like me identify cases of fraud, we are told that the number of incidents of voter fraud is too insignificant to matter. Now, however, facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on November 8, 2016: New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshire’s four electoral college votes in the presidential election. New Hampshire is one of fifteen states that allow same-day voter registration. The benefit of same-day registration is that it allows a person who has procrastinated or has forgotten to register to nonetheless cast a ballot on election day. The downside of same-day registration is that it does not allow the state time to assess the eligibility of the voter. A volunteer poll worker simply accepts a modicum of identification and takes the voter at his word that he’s a U.S. citizen resident of the state who is eligible to vote. New Hampshire is also a battleground state. Unlike neighboring Massachusetts and Vermont, which reliably vote for the Democrat in presidential elections, New Hampshire can swing either way. It has long been reported, anecdotally, that out-of-staters take advantage of New Hampshire’s same-day registration and head to the Granite State to cast fraudulent votes. Now there’s proof. According to statistics released by the Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, on the date of the general election in November 2016, there were 6,540 same-day registrants who registered to vote in New Hampshire using an out-of-state driver’s license to prove their identity. In and of itself, that doesn’t prove that any fraud occurred – theoretically, each of those individuals could have been someone who recently moved to the State and had not yet had time to get a New Hampshire driver’s license. According to New Hampshire law, a new resident has 60 days to obtain a New Hampshire driver’s license. So if those 6,540 voters were bona fide New Hampshire residents, they would get their driver’s license no later than January 7, 2017. However, the numbers tell a very different story. It turns out that, as of August 30, 2017 – nearly ten months after the election – only 1,014 of the 6,540 same-day registrants who registered with an out-of-state license had obtained a New Hampshire driver’s license. The other 5,526 individuals never obtained a New Hampshire driver’s license. And, of those 5,526, only 213 registered a vehicle in New Hampshire. So 5,313 of those voters neither obtained a New Hampshire driver’s license nor registered a vehicle in New Hampshire. They have not followed the legal requirements for residents regarding driver’s licenses, and it appears that they are not actually residing in New Hampshire. It seems that they never were bona fide residents of the State. 5,513 is a big number – more than enough to swing two very important elections. The closest major election was the contest between incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte and challenger Maggie Hassan (D). Hassan won the election by a razor-thin margin of 1,017 votes. Those 5,313 fraudulent votes were more than enough to swing the election. If 59.2 percent or more of them went for Hassan, then the election was stolen through voter fraud. That’s likely, since the surrounding states are Democrat strongholds. It’s also possible that New Hampshire’s four electoral college votes were swung to Hillary Clinton through illegal voting by nonresidents. Clinton won New Hampshire by only 2,732 votes. If 74.8 percent of the 5,513 fraudulent votes were cast for Clinton, then the presidential election in New Hampshire was tipped as well. If the presidential contest had been closer and had come down to a margin of three or four electoral college votes, then this voter fraud might have had extraordinary consequences. Regardless, in the Senate contest, it is highly likely that voting by nonresidents changed the result. And that is already having consequences for the nation. If the 52-48 Republican-Democrat balance in the Senate were 53-47, it could change the balance in any number of votes – not the least of which would be the effort to repeal Obamacare. But the mainstream media will tell us, “Move along, there’s nothing to see here.” Kris W. Kobach is the elected Secretary of State of Kansas.

00d55f13	Contrary to complaints from many Nigerians, the Presidency has said that the prices of food items across the nation are dropping. Speaking on behalf of the presidency, Mr Garba Shehu says the significant drop in prices of food items stems from President Muhammadu Buhari’s reforms in the agricultural sector. Mr Shehu who on Friday was a guest on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily said though prices may differ depending on the state and area, however, on the general, there is a drop in prices of food items. READ ALSO: Forex Ban: Buhari’s Directive To CBN Borne Out Of Patriotism – Garba Shehu While reacting to the President’s directive Thursday that the Central Bank of Nigeria should with immediate effect stop the release of money for food and fertiliser importation, the presidential spokesman said his principal’s intentions are in the best interest of the country. He said, “Nigerians must give consideration for the fact that the President’s directive to the CBN is driven by nothing other than a patriotic motive”. According to Mr Shehu, this directive falls in line with the President’s quest to boost agriculture in the country, a position to which some persons disagree, arguing that the CBN’s policies should not be imposed by a political authority. Addressing those who hold the view that Buhari’s directive is overreaching, Mr Shehu said, “I am not sure there is anywhere in the world that the Central Bank is So independent that it will operate as foreign ownership”.

c57f8234	People with lung cancer are dying after being diagnosed late in A&E because their GP missed signs of the disease despite often repeated visits, experts have revealed. As many as 56% of people in some parts of England who get lung cancer are only diagnosed when they visit A&E, according to a report by the UK Lung Cancer Coalition. They are five times more likely to die within a year than those whose condition has been identified either by their GP or through the NHS cancer screening programme. Family doctors often fail to diagnose cases of lung cancer until it is too late to treat effectively or miss them altogether, leading patients to seek help at A&E, the report says. More than a third of lung cancer patients see their GP three or more times before being referred for tests. That is a key factor in the UK’s poor record, in international terms, at diagnosing the disease early. Lung cancer is the third commonest form of cancer in the UK and the biggest cancer killer, claiming 35,000 lives a year. “People diagnosed in A&E are dying as a result of delays in identifying their illness. Late diagnosis makes lung cancer harder to treat and is a major reason why we have such poor survival in the UK,” said Prof Mick Peake, chair of the coalition’s clinical advisory group. It is “a travesty” that admission to hospital as a medical emergency is the single commonest way the disease is diagnosed, added Peake, who is also the clinical director of the Centre for Cancer Outcomes at University College Hospital London. GPs’ failure to spot symptoms of lung cancer is only one reason for Britain’s low rate of early diagnosis and high rate of lung cancer mortality, Peake stressed. However, he added: “There is good evidence that there are missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis in primary care and we strongly urge GPs to have a low threshold for doing a chest X-ray or CT scan in patients where there is any suspicion of lung cancer.” Patients’ reluctance to have symptoms, such as a persistent cough, checked out can delay diagnosis too, especially those from poorer households and older people. NHS data cited by Peake shows a postcode lottery in which Tower Hamlets in east London has the highest proportion of patients whose disease is diagnosed in A&E – 56.2% – closely followed by Manchester 56.1% and Leeds south and east 54%. More than 50% of patients are also diagnosed in A&E in Salford, Hull, South Tyneside and Sunderland. In contrast, only 14.7% of sufferers in Guildford and Waverley in Surrey are diagnosed that way, with low rates also in Wokingham in Berkshire 15.7% and Harrogate 16%. Dr Moira Fraser-Pearce, director of policy, campaigns and influence at Macmillan Cancer Support, said that staff shortages in NHS cancer services and heavy workloads were exacerbating the complex reasons for the high level of diagnosis in A&E. Macmillan has helped NHS England develop a new way of screening smokers and other high-risk patients for lung cancer by offering tests in trucks, often situated in supermarket car parks. The NHS did not comment directly on the findings but a spokesperson said that: “The NHS is catching more cancers earlier when they are easier to treat, resulting in record lung cancer survival rates.” Targeted lung health checks in locations such as supermarket car parks will detect “thousands more cases of cancer that might not have been detected otherwise, saving even more lives”, they added. NHS England has pledged to diagnose three in four cases of cancer at an early stage by 2028. Currently 57% of lung cancers are diagnosed late, greatly reducing chance of survival.	A team of scientists from Canada have identified at least 13 strains of cannabis sativa they believe can aid in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The President of the United States of America has spent the past few weeks touting a dangerous drug called hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic treatment for COVID-19. Unfortunately, the president’s expertise is in reality TV, not medicine. Several studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine, a drug designed to treat malaria, has dangerous side-effects when used to treat coronavirus, including death. The quest for a COVID-19 drug that will both make Donald Trump and his friends in the pharmaceutical industry rich and not kill the people who take it has, so far, netted no results. But exciting government-sponsored research out of Canada seems to indicate a different approach is in order. Per the team’s research paper: “ We have developed over 800 new Cannabis sativa lines and extracts and hypothesized that high-CBD C. sativa extracts may be used to modulate ACE2 expression in COVID-19 target tissues. Screening C. sativa extracts using artificial human 3D models of oral, airway, and intestinal tissues, we identified 13 high CBD C. sativa extracts that modulate ACE2 gene expression and ACE2 protein levels. Our initial data suggest that some C. sativa extract down-regulate serine protease TMPRSS2, another critical protein required for SARS-CoV2 entry into host cells. What this means is the team has carefully developed several cannabis strains that have been experimentally shown to make it significantly more difficult for the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus to find a home inside of the tissue cells it latches onto in order to infect us with the COVID-19 disease. It does not mean you should run out to your local dispensary and exhaust their sativa and CBD supply. The 13 strains cultivated by the researchers are almost certainly very different from whatever wacky-named strains you’re going to purchase over the counter. But, if you must take an untested treatment, I recommend taking Canada‘s lead and legally imbibing cannabis instead of listening to the Trump administration. A recent study led by Harvard Medical School professor Mandeep Mehra which looked at data from more than 96,000 COVID-19 patients, 15,000 of which had been treated with hydroxychloroquine, clearly showed that patients using the drug were at far greater risk for death than those who did not. Per a report from the Washington Post: “ For those given hydroxychloroquine, there was a 34 percent increase in risk of mortality and a 137 percent increased risk of a serious heart arrhythmias. For those receiving hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic — the cocktail endorsed by Trump — there was a 45 percent increased risk of death and a 411 percent increased risk of serious heart arrhythmias. Those given chloroquine had a 37 percent increased risk of death and a 256 percent increased risk of serious heart arrhythmias. For those taking chloroquine and an antibiotic, there was a 37 percent increased risk of death and a 301 percent increased risk of serious heart arrhythmias. Donald Trump recently told reporters and the US public that he’d been taking hydroxycholoroquine as a preventative measure to ward off COVID-19. Excepting the fact he has a small financial stake in Plaquenil – the drug name for hydroxycholoroquine — if he really wants to prevent COVID-19 he should imbibe cannabis. There’s no peer-reviewed evidence showing it’ll work, but at least it won’t kill him. Not only has no one ever died from imbibing cannabis, it has clear medical benefits for the prevention and treatment of diseases ranging from viral infections to cancer. That, and he might be less of an asshole if he smoked a joint every now and again. For more information on the cannabis study, check out the full pre-print research paper here. And if you want to know more about why nobody should use hydroxycholorquine to prevent or treat COVID-19, please read this important study.	false
7d5ccffa	Global average temperatures over land have plummeted by more than 1C since the middle of this year – their biggest and steepest fall on record. The news comes amid mounting evidence that the recent run of world record high temperatures is about to end. The fall, revealed by Nasa satellite measurements of the lower atmosphere, has been caused by the end of El Nino – the warming of surface waters in a vast area of the Pacific west of Central America. Global average temperatures over land have plummeted by more than 1C since the middle of this year – their biggest and steepest fall on record Some scientists, including Dr Gavin Schmidt, head of Nasa’s climate division, have claimed that the recent highs were mainly the result of long-term global warming. Others have argued that the records were caused by El Nino, a complex natural phenomenon that takes place every few years, and has nothing to do with greenhouse gas emissions by humans. The new fall in temperatures suggests they were right. Big El Ninos always have an immense impact on world weather, triggering higher than normal temperatures over huge swathes of the world. The 2015-16 El Nino was probably the strongest since accurate measurements began, with the water up to 3C warmer than usual. It has now been replaced by a La Nina event – when the water in the same Pacific region turns colder than normal. Last week, Mr Trump’s science adviser Bob Walker said he was likely to axe Nasa’s $1.9 billion (about £1.4 billion) climate research budget This also has worldwide impacts, driving temperatures down rather than up. The satellite measurements over land respond quickly to El Nino and La Nina. Temperatures over the sea are also falling, but not as fast, because the sea retains heat for longer. This means it is possible that by some yardsticks, 2016 will be declared as hot as 2015 or even slightly hotter – because El Nino did not vanish until the middle of the year. But it is almost certain that next year, large falls will also be measured over the oceans, and by weather station thermometers on the surface of the planet – exactly as happened after the end of the last very strong El Nino in 1998. If so, some experts will be forced to eat their words. Last year, Dr Schmidt said 2015 would have been a record hot year even without El Nino. ‘The reason why this is such a warm record year is because of the long-term underlying trend, the cumulative effect of the long-term warming trend of our Earth,’ he said. This was ‘mainly caused’ by the emission of greenhouse gases by humans. Dr Schmidt also denied that there was any ‘pause’ or ‘hiatus’ in global warming between the 1998 and 2015 El Ninos. But on its website home page yesterday, Nasa featured a new study which said there was a hiatus in global warming before the recent El Nino, and discussed why this was so. Last night Dr Schmidt had not returned a request for comment. However, both his own position, and his Nasa division, may be in jeopardy. US President-elect Donald Trump is an avowed climate change sceptic, who once claimed it was a hoax invented by China. Last week, Mr Trump’s science adviser Bob Walker said he was likely to axe Nasa’s $1.9 billion (about £1.4 billion) climate research budget. The Pacific warming can trigger floods, such as those in Peru, pictured above Other experts have also disputed Dr Schmidt’s claims. Professor Judith Curry, of the Georgia Institute of Technology, and president of the Climate Forecast Applications Network, said yesterday: ‘I disagree with Gavin. The record warm years of 2015 and 2016 were primarily caused by the super El Nino.’ The slowdown in warming was, she added, real, and all the evidence suggested that since 1998, the rate of global warming has been much slower than predicted by computer models – about 1C per century. David Whitehouse, a scientist who works with Lord Lawson’s sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation, said the massive fall in temperatures following the end of El Nino meant the warming hiatus or slowdown may be coming back. ‘According to the satellites, the late 2016 temperatures are returning to the levels they were at after the 1998 El Nino.

2855fe5a	"TIJUANA, Mexico — It’s the image from the unfolding crisis in Tijuana seen around the world: a migrant mom and her young children running away from a smoking tear gas canister with barbed wire and a forbidding metal wall in the background. Both children are clad only in T-shirts, and one appears to be wearing a pull-up diaper. One child is barefoot, another wears flip-flops. The woman clutching their arms and dragging them out of harm's way is wearing black leggings and a T-shirt emblazoned with the smiling cartoon faces of the Anna and Elsa from the Disney movie ""Frozen."" That jarring portrait was captured on camera Sunday by veteran Reuters photographer Kim Kyung-Hoon moments after a group of Central American migrants approached the border crossing into San Diego and were forced backwards by tear gas canisters hurled by U.S. border agents. ""When the tear gas started, some people were screaming and everybody started running away,” Kim told NBC News on Monday. ""I saw the woman and two children running away. One girl was barefoot from the beginning. The other was wearing beach sandals and lost them in the chaos."" NBC News also tracked down the woman, Maria Mesa, a 39-year-old mother of five from Honduras, inside a tent at the Benito Juarez Shelter in Tijuana. ""I grabbed my children and ran,"" Mesa said of her 5-year-old twin daughters Saira and Sheilly. Mesa said her 3-year-old son James, who does not appear in the picture, was also with them and fainted after getting a lung-full of gas. ""One of them could have died,"" she said. Kim said Mesa ""was travelling with five children."" ""Their father lives in Louisiana and they are trying to reach him,"" he said. Kim's photograph, which appeared on the NBC News website and on the front pages of numerous newspapers, provoked worldwide outrage and appeared to make a lie of President Donald Trump’s claim that the caravans were an invading force of ""criminals"" and ""gang members."" But Trump defended tear-gassing the migrants, calling them ""some very tough people."" Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries. Do it by plane, do it by bus, do it anyway you want, but they are NOT coming into the U.S.A. We will close the Border permanently if need be. Congress, fund the WALL! — Donald J.

In the 16 years he’s worked for Reuters, he has covered everything from plane crashes to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated Japan. The latest assignment began for Kim on Nov. 14 when he arrived in Mexico City and began following the migrant caravans escaping the terror in the home countries and heading north for the American border. On Sunday, the group Kim had been shadowing was at the El Chaparral border crossing and the U.S. was in sight. Reuters photographer Kim Kyung-Hoon works in Minamisoma, Japan, on April 11, 2011. Minamisoma is a city 11 miles away from the Fukushima nuclear power station that was hit by an earthquake and tsunami. Kim Kyung-Hoon / Reuters file ""They were stopped at one spot by the Mexican police,"" the photographer said. ""Then they climbed down the river bank. The wire fence was on the other side of the river about 20 meters away."" Kim said he watched as the mother and the twins started fording the shallow river at the border. Asked if that was why the girls were wearing next to nothing, the photographer said he believes that was all the clothing they had. For a few seconds, Kim said, he was distracted by two men who had already made it across and were using their bare hands and a bucket to dig a hole under a fence so they could crawl under. Then, suddenly, the air was filled with choking smoke. ""One canister fell by the family and they started running away,"" he said, referring to the mother and twins. Migrants ride on the back of a truck while making their way to Tijuana from Mexicali, Mexico, on Nov. 20. Kim Kyung-Hoon / Reuters Kim said he could hear the little girls coughing and crying and he immediately aimed his camera in their direction and starting shooting the unfolding chaos. He said he stayed with them as they fled back to the migrant encampment. Asked if he was rattled by what he witnessed and the heartbreaking sounds of children crying, Kim said ""my job is to document what is happening."" ""I try not to let my emotions get involved in my work,"" he said. CORRECTION (Nov. 27, 2018, 7:50 a.m.): An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the children in the photograph. One child was wearing sandals; they were not both barefoot. Gabe Gutierrez reported from Tijuana, and Corky Siemaszko from New York City."	A discussion of ‘smokers’ black lungs’ started in the comments today. It’s the widespread belief that smokers’ lungs turn black. Rose pointed out that it all started with James I about four centuries ago. She also dug up some refutations: “Dr. Duane Carr – Professor of Surgery at the University of Tennessee College of Medicine, said this: “Smoking does not discolor the lung.” (link) Dr. Victor Buhler, Pathologist at St. Joseph Hospital in Kansas City: “I have examined thousands of lungs both grossly and microscopically. I cannot tell you from examining a lung whether or not its former host had smoked.” (link) Dr. Sheldon Sommers, Pathologist and Director of Laboratories at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York: “…it is not possible grossly or microscopically, or in any other way known to me, to distinguish between the lung of a smoker or a nonsmoker. Blackening of lungs is from carbon particles, and smoking tobacco does not introduce carbon particles into the lung.” (link) And Brigitte even found a Youtube video: There is even this (in German) in which a forensic medic states that these “tar” lungs do not exist. Rich White’s Smoke Screens reports the same: This was confirmed by Dr Jan Zeldenrust, a Dutch pathologist for the Government of Holland from 1951 – 1984. In a television interview in the 1980’s he stated that, translated from Dutch, “I could never see on a pair of lungs if they belonged to a smoker or non-smoker. I can see clearly the difference between sick and healthy lungs. The only black lungs I’ve seen are from peat-workers and coal miners, never from smokers”. smokers-lungs1Nevertheless, the black lungs are all over cigarette packets these days. And black lung disease (or pneumoconiosis) is a real disease. Coal miners get it. So where does the smokers’ black lung idea come from? Part of the answer can be found in a photo-essay on Medicinenet: This photo essay will focus on smoker’s lung. The term “smoker’s lung” refers to the structural and functional abnormalities (diseases) in the lung caused by cigarette smoking. First, the normal structure and function of the lung will be described and illustrated. Then, the structural and functional abnormalities caused by smoking will be described and illustrated. A bit further on the effect of emphysema on lungs is described. emphysemaAs a result, emphysema also disrupts the normal blood supply. Figure 4 contrasts the nasty appearance of a smoker’s emphysematous lung with a normal lung. So it’s emphysema that causes the nasty appearance of a smoker’s emphysematous lung. It continues: As you can imagine, cigarette smoke contains many impurities that are inhaled in great numbers directly into the lung. For this reason, the alveolar spaces of the smoker contain numerous scavenger cells (macrophages) that are filled with engulfed (phagocytized) particles of impurities and debris, as illustrated in Figure 5. Under the microscope, with this high magnification, you can actually see the black and brown engulfed particles in the alveolar scavenger cells. Indeed, smoker’s lung may have so much of this particulate material that the lung looks gray-black to the naked eye. So, most of the time, you don’t need a microscope to tell if someone is or was a heavy smoker. A naked eye examination of a smoker’s lung usually will reveal an enlarged gray-black lung with enlarged air spaces (the emphysema, as you saw in Figure 4 and will see again in Figure 8). I’m not sure why people are asked to ‘imagine’ what’s in tobacco smoke. But since the emphysematous lung has simply been renamed the ‘smoker’s lung’, maybe it’s necessary to explain why it’s turned grey-black. And it’s that imaginary stuff in tobacco smoke that is conjured up to explain it. The lie hinges on first asserting that smoking causes emphysema (it may do, or it may not), and secondly asserting that emphysema turns lungs grey-black (it probably does), and then finally dropping the connecting middle term of ’emphysema’,  and asserting that smoking turns lungs grey-black. Or it’s just calling emphysematous lungs ‘smokers’ lungs’. A parallel false ascription might be found elsewhere. People who visit Delhi may get food poisoning from ingesting bacteria. The food poisoning may cause vomiting and so on. But if the ‘bacteria’ link is missed out, and the malady is just called ‘Delhi belly’ (as it often is), it may mislead people into believing that it’s visiting Delhi (or Indian restaurants) which is the root of the trouble – although in fact most visitors to Delhi (and Indian restaurants) don’t suffer such ill-effects, and there are lots of other places in the world other than Delhi where you can contract ‘Delhi belly’. It’s a thoroughly dishonest and disreputable mis-attribution of a disease. It pins the disease on a particular social group: smokers. And it makes it their disease, and nobody else’s – even though not everyone who gets emphysema is a smoker, and not all smokers get emphysema. But at least we may now see why pathologists aren’t finding grey-black smokers’ lungs: they didn’t have emphysema. But this doesn’t seem to be the only way the black lung lie is propagated. There are also the pigs’ lungs used in demonstrations. I even found an ad for one: The accompanying text helpfully explains: The inflatable swine lungs have been stained realistically and then specially preserved by the BioFlex odorless, nontoxic process that retains the texture and elasticity of fresh lungs. The lungs dramatically and unforgettably demonstrate the effects of prolonged smoking. A palpable simulated internal tumor and a physical simulated external tumor encourage students to feel the texture of the lungs, and to remember that smoking is a known cause of lung cancer. So firstly they’re pig lungs. And secondly they’ve been preserved and stained realistically. And simulated internal and external tumours have been added. And all to demonstrate the effects of prolonged smoking!  It beggars belief. No doubt the students aren’t told any of this, and are led to believe that they’re looking at real human ‘smokers’ lungs’. There are even discussions of the effectiveness of such imagery. Marketing researchers at the University of Arkansas, Villanova University and Marquette University surveyed more than 500 U.S. and Canadian smokers and found that the highly graphic images of the negative consequences of smoking have the greatest impact on smokers’ intentions to quit. The most graphic images, such as those showing severe mouth diseases, including disfigured, blackened and cancerous tissue, evoked fear about the consequences of smoking and thus influenced consumer intentions to quit. “These results suggest that there appears to be little downside on intentions to quit from using extremely graphic pictorial depictions of the negative health outcomes due to smoking,” said Scot Burton, co-author of the study and marketing professor in the Sam M. Walton College of Business. In fact, there may be a downside from using such graphic images, if they have been fraudulently obtained (a consideration which doesn’t appear to have crossed the minds of the marketing researchers). And we’ve just established two methods by which they are fraudulently obtained. And the downside is that, when it is shown that they’re fraudulent, the people who publish them will be accused of fraud, of twisting logic and manufacturing evidence. And when that happens, people will cease to believe not just the fraudulent evidence they have produced, but everything else that they assert too. They will lose all their credibility. Nobody will believe a word they say. That’s quite a big downside, I think. And it’s a downside that doesn’t even seem to have occurred to them. It doesn’t seem to have occurred to the mass media that help propagate these lies that people will cease to believe a word they say either. Nor does it seem to have occurred to the medical profession which allows these lies to be propagated unchallenged that people will cease to believe them too. There’s an awful lot of downside waiting to go down.	true

The news comes days after Julia Roberts slammed Celine Dion for criticizing the POTUS and stating that she “hates America.“ “I can’t even look at an American flag anymore. I hate this country,” Canadian Celine Dion said, while complaining about the Trump presidency. “You’re wrong, Celine,” Julia Roberts fired back. “The America we know and love was destroyed by Obama and his disastrous presidency. If you disagree you can always go back to your own country. In fact, perhaps you really should.” Celine Dion was one of dozens of liberal celebrities who “threatened” to leave the United States and return to their homelands if America elected Donald Trump as president. So far, a grand total of zero of these liberal celebrities have followed through with their threat to leave. The sheer hypocrisy makes it hard to believe they really feel as strongly as they claim about Trump. It’s all hot air and virtue signaling from the celebrity contingent on the left."	111 line increasing pressure on NHS, say leading doctors	false

ccfaeb64	Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month. Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline. Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas. In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017. A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program. “The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims. Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3. The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters. But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce. The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further. Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing.

3552384d	In Miami Beach, the city engineer, Bruce A. Mowry, has come up with a plan for combating the flooding. He rips up problematic streets, raises them with extra dirt and repaves them, installing new drains and giant pumps that can push water back into the bay. The approach has already been shown to work in several neighborhoods. A controversy has erupted about whether Miami Beach is polluting Biscayne Bay with the water, but the city is pushing ahead. Miami Beach plans to spend at least $400 million on its plan by 2018, raising the money through fees imposed on homes and businesses. The huge county government for the region, Miami-Dade County, is developing its own resilience strategy, one likely to cost billions. It has committed to rebuilding some of its decaying infrastructure, like a sewage plant, in a way that safeguards against sea-level rise and storm surges. “I don’t see doom and gloom here; I see opportunity,” said Harvey Ruvin, the clerk of courts for Miami-Dade County, who has been a leading voice on the environment in Florida for a half-century, and who recently led a county task force on sea-level rise. “We’re talking about the most robust possible jobs program you can think of, and one that can’t be outsourced.” Many of the Republican mayors in the region are on the same page as Democrats in requesting national and state action on climate change, as well as pushing local steps. James C. Cason, the Republican mayor of Coral Gables, has convened informational sessions that draw hundreds of residents, and he has received no complaints for his stance. “I hope in coming years when we have to spend a lot of money, the citizens will still support it,” Mr. Cason said in an interview. Still, his city, and others in South Florida, have some hard decisions to make. Some property owners cannot afford to raise their sea walls, putting their neighborhoods at increased risk of flooding. Will they be held legally responsible when floods do occur? A strict policy could force some people from their homes. Conversely, should public money be spent to do the work, even if it largely benefits private property?	Vladimir Putin condemns Europe’s handling of migrants	true
64d89844	"COLUMBUS, Ohio - This July, Ohio will begin tracking arsonists through a new registry similar to the one used to track sex offenders. The law, passed by the Ohio General Assembly late last year without much attention, will require people convicted of arson-related offenses to register at their local sheriff's office each year for at least 10 years. Those who fail to register will be charged with a felony. Supporters tout the measure as another tool for law enforcement in investigating the difficult-to-solve crime. But critics argue the registry will be burdensome, and that arson is not a significant enough problem in Ohio to warrant an official registry, especially one that is kept from the public's eyes. ""There is a huge problem with arson in Ohio,"" said Sen. Tim Schaffer, a Lancaster Republican who sponsored the bill. With the registry, law enforcement ""can look up who all the convicted arsonists are, who have done their time and are back at home or back in the community. Chances are good that it's a repeat offender, and you already know who . . . it might be."" Last year, 8,377 ""suspicious"" fires were reported, which resulted in more than $160 million in estimated damages, according to the Ohio State Fire Marshal. There are approximately 500 convictions of arson each year, according to the Buckeye State Sheriff's Association. ""I don't know where it came from,"" Amy Borror, spokeswoman for the Ohio Public Defender's Office, said of the new law. ""I don't know why we have it."" Borror said the law will put unnecessary work on the shoulders of local sheriffs, who will be tasked with compiling the list in addition to the sex-offender registry they already put together. ""The sex-offender registry has been around for a long time, and the research that's out there says that it has no positive impact on the public safety,"" Borror said. ""And, if anything, it might have a negative impact on public safety because it creates this administrative burden."" Nick Worner, spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union, said a registry for arson seems arbitrary and will do little to solve crimes because ""rounding up the usual suspects"" is rarely an effective investigation method. ""Are we eventually going to have a registry for everything?"" Worner said. ""Will we have a shoplifters registry, where if something comes up missing at JC Penney's, they round up everybody who has ever been convicted of shoplifting and start there? ""Generally, the problem with this sort of thing is that it's supposed to start with the gathering of evidence in the investigation and then the detaining of people based on suspicion. This kind of does that backwards."" Worner also expressed concern that money needed to maintain the registry may end up coming from taxpayers' pockets. He said fees paid by offenders are supposed to finance registries, but that does not necessarily mean they will make the payments. Another big concern, Worner said, is that unlike the sex-offender registry, this one is not publicly available, meaning only law enforcement has access to the list. ""I think we would argue there is an issue with gathering this information in the first place, but it's an important question to ask: If you have to exempt the information from public-records law, should you be gathering it in the first place?"" Worner asked. Borror noted that the sex-offender registry has errors and inconsistencies, and the arsonist list will remain unchecked by the public, leaving many potential problems unaddressed. Schaffer said the list will not be public because arson-related crimes are very different from sex offenses, and he has received no demand to make the list public. ""I haven't had one member of the public ask me for access to this law-enforcement tool,"" Schaffer said. ""It's a law-enforcement tool. It's for the same reason that you can't access the state of Ohio's database for people's license plates. What's the purpose?"" He said providing the registry to the public is not off the table, but Ohioans would have to express a desire to see the list. Robert Cornwell, executive director of the Buckeye State Sheriff's Association, said he was pleased with the new law, which he said should provide new techniques for arson investigators. Cornwell said his organization approves of the registry because police should know the whereabouts of convicted arsonists. He did not estimate a much-larger workload for sheriffs in compiling the registry. Michael Duchesne, spokesman for the State Fire Marshal, also expressed support of the registry, saying it will afford law enforcement more options when investigating arson-related crimes. He said there are enough suspicious fires in Ohio to necessitate the registry. Worner, with the ACLU, said even if the list is a new tool for law enforcement, it will not prove crimes. Ohioans should worry about the precedent the arson registry may create, he said. ""You have to look down the road,"" Worner said. ""If there's a registry here and a registry here, what's next?"""

ad333c3f	Theresa May's hopes of winning a landslide Election victory suffered a major blow last night after her poll lead plummeted to 11 per cent amid the row over her tax and pension plans. A Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday put the Conservatives on 40 per cent, followed by Labour on 29 per cent and the Lib Dems and Ukip level on 11 per cent. It means Mrs May’s lead over Jeremy Corbyn has nearly halved in four days: a poll immediately after she called the Election gave the Tories a 21-point advantage. A poll for the Mail on Sunday put the Conservatives on 40 per cent, followed by Labour on 29 per cent. It comes after backlash against the threat to drop pledges not to increase tax and to guarantee a minimum 2.5 per cent annual rise in pensions Polling expert Professor John Curtice said the Survation figures would give Mrs May a Commons majority of 46, an improvement on her current working majority of 17, but way below some forecasts of a 140-seat majority. The Conservative slump follows the threat to drop existing pledges not to increase tax and to guarantee a minimum 2.5 per cent annual rise in pensions. The backlash was further fuelled by Mrs May’s surprise announcement that she will not abandon the Party’s controversial promise to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid. The Mail on Sunday poll is the only one to have been conducted after all three stories broke, and shows voters are less likely to vote Tory as a result. The Prime Minister spurned three opportunities yesterday to contradict claims that she will drop David Cameron’s 2015 Election pledge not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT until 2020. Put on the spot repeatedly at an election hustings in Dudley, West Midlands, she avoided giving a direct answer, merely stressing the Tories were a party of ‘low taxation’. Mr Corbyn immediately promised to protect pensions. Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked a tax scare, saying it was ‘self-evidently clear that the commitments in the 2015 manifesto strain the Government’s ability to manage the economy flexibly’ She said: ‘People are going to have a very clear election choice between a Conservative Party which always has been and will continue to be a party that believes in lower taxes. Or Labour, whose natural instinct is to always raise taxes.’ The Tory turmoil came after Mrs May refused to say she would stick to the so-called pensions ‘triple lock’ when questioned in her Maidenhead constituency on Friday. And Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked a tax scare, saying it was ‘self-evidently clear that the commitments in the 2015 manifesto strain the Government’s ability to manage the economy flexibly.’ Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell immediately called Mr Hammond’s statement a ‘Tory tax bombshell’, hijacking the Tories’ former slogan against Labour. 42 per cent said a Tory landslide would be ‘good’ for Britain with 36 per cent against. Former Belgian PM Guy Verhofstadt accused her of ‘an attempted power grab Tory MPs refused to comment publicly for fear of upsetting the party’s chances of success on June 8. However, privately, they were deeply critical. ‘It is an very untidy start to our campaign,’ said one. ‘Someone needs to get hold of our message – and fast. This is not the way to win votes.’ Former Tory Chancellor Norman Lamont said: ‘I think Phillip Hammond is just trying to get some flexibility back into the system, although whether he was wise to say it is a different matter. ‘It is pretty ironic for Labour, of all people, to be using the “tax bombshell” line’. Senior Tory sources insisted ‘no final decision’ had been made on the Party’s manifesto stance on pensions and tax. Labour and the Lib Dems seized on the confusion. Mr Corbyn immediately promised to protect pensions, and former Lib Dem Cabinet Minister Vince Cable said: ‘Mr Hammond admitted taxes would have to rise, no doubt due to Mrs May’s hard Brexit that could leave a £100 billion black hole in the public finances. 'You can’t have a strong economy and a hard Brexit.’ Asked in the poll if Mrs May’s refusal to rule out ending the pensions guarantee would affect their vote, 28 per cent said they were less likely to vote Tory, against 17 per cent who were more likely. Mr Hammond’s refusal to rule out raising tax prompted a similar negative response. And 34 per cent said refusing to cut overseas aid would make them less likely to vote Conservative. Only 13 per cent said they were more likely. former Lib Dem Cabinet Minister Vince Cable said: 'You can’t have a strong economy and a hard Brexit.’ Mrs May was yesterday branded a ‘political opportunist’ by the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator over the snap Election The tax row comes just weeks after Hammond was forced to scrap plans to increase national insurance for the self-employed amid uproar over the effect on ‘white van man’ and the fact that it breached the 2015 manifesto vow on tax rises. Despite the sharply reduced lead, voters appear relaxed by the prospect of a Tory landslide. A total of 42 per cent said it would be ‘good’ for Britain with 36 per cent against. There was more Tory confusion last night as Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen claimed a ‘senior Government figure’ had told him the Party manifesto would include a commitment to scrap the controversial High Speed 2 train link to Birmingham. Downing Street sources denied the claim. And Mrs May was yesterday branded a ‘political opportunist’ by the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator over the snap Election. Former Belgian PM Guy Verhofstadt accused her of ‘an attempted power grab... before the reality of Brexit bites’. Last night an Opinium poll, taken before the tax, pensions and overseas aid row, put the Tory lead at 19 points.	Profile: Seal Team Six	false

""We have received a number of calls regarding how to enter security information for a baby that has not yet been born,"" Shafer wrote. ""Crazy as it may sound, you MUST include the baby in the overall count of guests in the tour. It’s an easy process."" The newsletter then proceeds to spell out how ""the baby’s security information should be entered"" into the White House system, including such details as: ""GENDER: if the parents know put that gender down if not, you can enter either M or F as we’ll ask you to update it at the time of birth."" All of the information should be updated ""once, the baby is born,"" the newsletter instructs. ""It is ironic that President Obama's staff recognizes the existence of unborn babies for purposes of providing security within the White House -- yet, there is no indication that President Obama has any problem with the fact that throughout the District of Columbia, abortion is now legal for any reason up to the moment of birth,” said Douglas Johnson, National Right to Life legislative director. “Notably, the newsletter provides no guidance on what the staff should do if an unborn baby is first registered for security purposes, but then aborted. On May 17, the House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee plans to hold a hearing on the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 3803), which would generally prohibit abortion in the sixth month and later in the District. If the President wants to provide for the security of the unborn child immediately outside of the White House gates, as well as inside, he should endorse this bill.""

The background includes some Dark Dimension-esque effects that make it looks as if time and reality are folding in on itself. All in all, it's totally on-brand for the character. See it for yourself below. Despite being hit with some massive pre-production changes, reports suggest the film is still on track to meet its release date. It's been said the movie will be the first ""scary"" movie within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, something Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige previously compared to Raiders of the Lost Ark. “I mean, there are horrifying sequences in Raiders that I as a little kid would [cover my eyes] when their faces melted. Or Temple of Doom, of course, or Gremlins, or Poltergeist,” Feige said. “These are the movies that invented the PG-13 rating, by the way. They were PG and then they were like, ‘We need another [rating].’ But that’s fun.

da2b6121	Anti-intellectual, anti-science, anti-education: In a disturbing development the Ohio House has passed legislation that would allow students to give wrong answers and not be penalized if those wrong answers are based on the student’s “sincerely held religious belief.” Cleveland.com reports: The Ohio House sent to the Senate on Wednesday a measure that would prohibit public schools from penalizing students for some work that contains religious beliefs. Critics have called the bill unnecessary or valuing religion over secularism… WKRC reports: The Ohio House on Wednesday passed the “Student Religious Liberties Act.” Under the law, students can’t be penalized if their work is scientifically wrong as long as the reasoning is because of their religious beliefs. Reporting on the new bill, Cleveland.com notes: If public school students turn in work saying the earth is only 10,000 years old, they cannot be penalized under Ohio House Bill 164 if its their religious beliefs. House Bill 164, known as the Ohio Student Religious Liberties Act of 2019, entails the following: Requires public schools to give students the same access to facilities if they want to meet for religious expression as they’d give secular groups. Removes a provision that allows school districts to limit religious expression to lunch periods or other non-instructional times. Allows students to engage in religious expression before, during and after school hours to the same extent as a student in secular activities or expression. Prohibits schools from restricting a student from engaging in religious expression in completion of homework, artwork and other assignments. In short, the proposed Ohio law would allow students to substitute religious dogma for science, and would not allow teachers to penalize students for giving wrong answers as long as those answers are based on the student’s religious beliefs. House Bill 164 passed by a vote of 61-3. Every Republican in the House supported the bill. It now moves to the Republican-controlled Senate. Bottom line: The Ohio House has passed legislation that would allow students to give wrong answers and not be penalized if those wrong answers are based on the student’s “sincerely held religious belief.”	Obama has Proposed 442 Tax Hikes Since Taking Office	false
7be6b208	"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday that former Vice President Joe Biden is ""considering"" forgiving $50,000 in federal student loan debt for every borrower with an annual salary of under $125,000 — a move that would place an incredibly heavy burden on taxpayers. More than 40 million Americans currently have outstanding federal loans, amounting to a whopping total of $1.54 trillion in debt. What did he say? ""We have come to the conclusion that President Biden can undo this debt, can forgive $50,000 of debt the first day he becomes president,"" Schumer announced to supporters outside of his New York office. ""You don't need Congress; all you need is the flick of a pen. ""I have told him how important it is. He is considering it,"" Schumer added after a reporter asked if he had spoken to Biden about the proposal. ""We believe he does [have the executive authority], and he's researching that. I believe that when he does his research, he will find that he does."" During the 2020 Democratic primary, Biden expressed support for a Democratic legislative proposal that would immediately cancel up to $10,000 in debt for each borrower. But since then, progressives in the party have been urging the former vice president to bypass Congress and cancel the debt by executive fiat. Whether it is constitutional for a president to take such an action remains in question. What else? Later during the event, a reporter pressed Schumer on the equity of debt cancelation. ""What about the families that have made sacrifices to pay off the student loans for their students? What about the students who have paid off their student loans?"" the reporter asked. ""Look,"" Schumer responded, ""lots of students paid off student loans, but it's such a burden it's good for everybody to make sure this debt is vanquished."" After the event had concluded, one of individuals standing next to Schumer, mocked the reporter's question, brushing it off as just the ""Fox News perspective"" on the issue. ""These people have great futures, but they are burdened by debt ... we want to remove it,"" Schumer had plainly stated during the event. Yet, despite Schumer's portrayal of debt cancelation as an obvious, kind solution, in reality, it is far from either. As TheBlaze previously reported, contrary to what progressive politicians claim, ""'canceling debt' is not something that actually exists. Lawmakers could remove a borrower's liability for re-paying the debt, but the debt will be shifted onto someone"" and ""in the case of federal student loans, the burden would be further shifted onto taxpayers."""

052f60f4	Earth Could Be Facing Another Ice Age, Scientists Warn Scientists studying Antarctica sea ice warn a rise in accumulation could spark the next ice age. Scientists studying Antarctica sea ice warn a rise in accumulation could spark an ice age. Computer simulations show that an explosion of sea ice would block the ocean from exchanging carbon dioxide with the atmosphere Computer simulations show that an explosion in ice circling the frozen desert would act as a lid on the ocean and block it from exchanging carbon dioxide with the atmosphere. This is capable of causing a reverse greenhouse effect, which would ultimately cool the earth and send our planet into an ice age for the first time in over two million years. The last major ice age is believed to have ended about 2.5 million years ago during the Pleistocene era. Since then, glaciers have periodically covered the earth, but then retreated and experts have now set out to understand the process behind an ice age — how it works and what triggers it. The latest study was conducted by a team at the University of Chicago who set out to discover and understand the processes that makeup global climate. Assistant professor Malte Jansen at the University of Chicago (UChicago) said, ‘One key question in the field is still what caused the Earth to periodically cycle in and out of ice ages.’ ‘We are pretty confident that the carbon balance between the atmosphere and ocean must have changed, but we don’t quite know how or why.’ This event is capable of causing a reverse greenhouse effect, which would ultimately cool the earth and send our planet into an ice age for the first time in over two million years Jansen and former UChicago postdoctoral researcher Alice Marzocchi developed computer simulations of Antarctica sea ice and found it not only changes ocean circulation but acts as a lid and blocks it from releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere – the less carbon in the air, the cooler the planet becomes. ‘What this suggests is that it’s a feedback loop,’ said Marzocchi, now a research scientist at the UK’s National Oceanography Center. ‘As the temperature drops, less carbon is released into the atmosphere, which triggers more cooling.’ The explanation fits with evidence about the past climate from sources like sediments, coral reefs, and core samples from glaciers. ‘What surprised me is how much of this increased storage can be attributed to physical changes alone, with Antarctic sea-ice cover being the key player,’ Marzocchi said.

Reacting to the question ASUU raised on Wednesday, some students responded positively stating different skills and trade they’ve learnt so far while some criticised the union for asking such question which they see as a mockery. Below are some reactions as seen on Twitter: @Blessedvic7 “Just imagine! Are you guys alright @ASUUNGR. You are using us to catch cruise while we are at home….wasting our lives and future and this nonsense is what you can come out to say…Its a Pity. No wonder you don’t want to accept the IPPIS system proposed by the FG.” @kingssdoms “Got admitted in UNI 2014 at d age of 18. Offered a 5 yr course. Was to graduate in 2019 at 23. We ar almost in 2021 yet I’ve not still graduated. If I eventually graduate next yr at 25, NYSC will delay for 1 yr before shortlisting at 26, I’ll finally start NYSC at 27 to pass out at 28” @hyodeji “Electronics repair when I should be In school neutral face” @_Legitlayo “Omoooo, I almost thought it was a parody account… Are you seriously asking this question handler?? Trade? If I been wan learn trade, would I stress myself over certificate?? Which kain insensitivity be this? Weary faceWeary faceWeary face” @Haeeshatu “Mad oooo…. Let’s open a GoFundMe for ASUU… If Erica can get more than 30million naira…. We should get more for Asuu if every one contribute” @UshieClemente “Is really shambolic that this is coming from your tweeter handle, but when the minister for state advice you guys to go into farming, you all faulted the ideas stating that farming is not you guys portion, meanwhile in the university we have offering agriculture and co.” @gaH_bOO “It’s not your business, call off the strike let’s write exams, get our certs and leave the country. That’s the skill I learnt; leaving Nigeria.” @MushinJidenna “I improve in my graphic design skills. I learnt GitHub programming. I opened a telegram movie/series channel which has gotten to over 1400 subscribers. Thanks ” @MusaAlhSule “What trade did you teach us? Abi should we use our certificates to wrap Akara and Suya?” @s_nnamchi “I started film making and editing at the same time. You should see my first video. I shot it with the android phone then did a mad sound and visual editing there.” @thisisOluwakemi “Guys, this is ASUU official Twitter account, not a parody. What’s going on in this country?” Note that an earlier version of this report stated that the academic body (ASUU) made that tweet. It has since been discovered, through a Dubawa FactCheck that ASUU has no Twitter account whatsoever. The story has since been corrected and updated and error regretted.

3963580	The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has yet again been caught exaggerating ‘global warming’ by fiddling with the raw temperature data. This time, that data concerns the recent record-breaking cold across the northeastern U.S. which NOAA is trying to erase from history. If you believe NOAA’s charts, there was nothing particularly unusual about this winter’s cold weather which caused sharks to freeze in the ocean and iguanas to drop out of trees. Here is NOAA’s January 2018 chart for Northeast U.S. – an area which includes New England along with NY, PA, NJ, DE and MD. You’d never guess from it that those regions had just experienced record-breaking cold, would you? That’s because, as Paul Homewood has discovered, NOAA has been cooking the books. Yet again – presumably for reasons more to do with ideology than meteorology – NOAA has adjusted past temperatures to look colder than they were and recent temperatures to look warmer than they were. We’re not talking fractions of a degree, here. The adjustments amount to a whopping 3.1 degrees F. This takes us well beyond the regions of error margins or innocent mistakes and deep into the realm of fiction and political propaganda. Homewood first smelt a rat when he examined the New York data sets. He was particularly puzzled at NOAA’s treatment of the especially cold winter that ravaged New York in 2013/14, which he describes here: The cold weather really began on Jan 2nd, when an Arctic front descended across much of the country, and extended well into March. The NWS wrote at the end of the winter: The winter of 2013-14 finished as one of the coldest winters in recent memory for New York State. Snowfall across Western and North Central New York was above normal for many areas, and in some locations well above normal. This winter comes on the heels of two previous mild winters, making the cold and snow this winter feel that much harsher. Temperatures this winter finished below normal every month, and the January through March timeframe finished at least 4 degrees below normal for the two primary climate stations of Western New York (Buffalo and Rochester)….. Relentless cold continued through the month of January across the region. So why, he wondered, did NOAA have this marked down as only the 30th coldest winter (since 1895) on its New York State charts, with a mean temperature of 16.9F? Homewood compared the local records for January 1943 and January 2014 – months which, according to NOAA’s charts, had very similar average temperatures. What he found was that NOAA’s charts were deeply inaccurate. The 2014 local temperatures had been adjusted upwards by NOAA and the 1943 local temperatures downwards. He concludes: On average the mean temperatures in Jan 2014 were 2.7F less than in 1943. Yet, according to NOAA, the difference was only 0.9F. Somehow, NOAA has adjusted past temperatures down, relatively, by 1.8F. Now, Homewood has given the same treatment to the most recent Big Freeze – the winter of 2017/2018. Yet again, he has found that NOAA’s arbitrary adjustments tell a lie. They claim that January 2018 was warmer in the New York region than January 1943, when the raw data from local stations tells us this just isn’t true. So at the three sites of Ithaca, Auburn and Geneva, we find that January 2018 was colder than January 1943 by 1.0, 1.7 and 1.3F respectively. Yet NOAA say that the division was 2.1F warmer last month. NOAA’s figure makes last month at least 3.1F warmer in comparison with 1943 than the actual station data warrants. He concludes: Clearly NOAA’s highly homogenised and adjusted version of the Central Lakes temperature record bears no resemblance at all the the actual station data. And if this one division is so badly in error, what confidence can there be that the rest of the US is any better? Well indeed. The key point here is that while NOAA frequently makes these adjustments to the raw data, it has never offered a convincing explanation as to why they are necessary. Nor yet, how exactly their adjusted data provides a more accurate version of the truth than the original data. One excuse NOAA’s apologists make is that weather stations are subject to changing environmental conditions. For example, when the station sited at Syracuse in 1929 was located at what was originally just a sparse aerodrome. Since then, however, as Homewood notes, it has grown into a large international airport with two runways servicing two million passengers a year. Its weather station readings therefore will certainly have been corrupted by the Urban Heat Island effect: that is, its temperature readings will have been artificially elevated by the warmth from the surrounding development and aircraft engines. So you’d think, wouldn’t you, that to compensate for this NOAA would adjust the recent temperatures downwards. Instead, for no obvious reasons, it has adjusted them upwards. This is a scandal. NOAA’s climate gatekeepers are political activists not honest scientists and the U.S. taxpayer has no business funding their propaganda. Drain the swamp!

136d378a	Unvaccinated Children Pose No Risk To Anyone, Says Harvard Immunologist	One of the strengths–and weaknesses–of a Western medical education is its predisposition to break things down and compartmentalize them. While much data is gleaned in the minutiae, very little attention is given to the interrelationship between disciplines. While a medical student may become a true specialist in their field, they too become compartmentalized, and are often ignorant of very important information that would be essential for a broader, more holistic overview. And this appears to be by design.  advertisement - learn more A case in point is the testimony of Tetyana Obukhanych, who earned her Ph.D. in Immunology at the Rockefeller University in New York and did post-graduate work at Harvard. In a presentation she delivered in British Columbia (full video here), she was discussing scientific evidence from a publication dealing with a measles outbreak in Quebec in 2011. The evidence showed that 48% of those who had contracted measles were fully vaccinated for measles, and this does not even include those who were vaccinated only once for the measles, as they get lumped in with the unvaccinated people. She took a moment to tell a story about how she became aware of this phenomenon: The interesting thing is that my field, the field of immunology, the basic field that sort of is responsible for all these theories of immunity, we don’t really deal with the real world. We do research in labs. We are sort of an ivory tower profession and we don’t even read these publications because this is too far away from our field. We only read what’s specific to our research and usually it’s immunizations and how antibodies are generated and all the details of the immune responses. And I went through my whole PhD training and I believed that vaccines give you immunity and that if you got vaccines there is absolutely no way, virtually no way, that you would get a disease, and I’m pretty sure that most of my colleagues in my narrow field believed the same way, and we had conversations about that. And even someone at some point mentioned to me and said that they had a vaccine and they got measles and I sort of brushed it aside and thought that the person is confused. It was either she didn’t have the vaccine or it wasn’t measles, one of the two. But what happen is that a few years ago I had to apply for American citizenship and part of the procedure is to submit your vaccination records, right, and this was the first time that I looked at my own vaccination records carefully, and I discovered that I had two measles vaccines in my childhood. Well, I didn’t know about it because I was too young to remember, but what I remember really well is that when I was 11 I had measles, and so that was a little bit harder to discount. And I told recently someone else and they said, ‘Oh, you are confused about that, you didn’t have measles!’ like ‘How do you know?’ ‘Did you check <whether> you really had the virus there or not?’ So it’s just, you know, the doctors diagnosis, right? But I lived in Ukraine, and there, you know, there was tons of measles around and doctors knew when they saw measles. But anyway, so the reason I kind of had to look for these papers is to actually to confirm to myself whether I’m confused about my measles or is this a general phenomenon and it’s happening, and it’s documented in the literature. And indeed it is documented in the literature. But immunologists don’t know about it. Let that sink in for a moment. You get your PhD in Immunology, and you leave school to go out into the world to work on things like, oh, immunization, and you haven’t learned that you can still get certain diseases even if you’ve been fully vaccinated against them? Despite this being scientifically documented and an uncontested fact? Again, ignorance by design.	false
eb73a5be	News reports have confirmed that actor Kirk Douglas died of natural causes late this afternoon, Los Angeles coroners office reported. This was just 4 days before he would have turned 101 years old. Family released a statement saying he “went comfortably and was in no pain” and “lived a long and prosperous life that people only dream of.” Kirk Douglas was an American actor, producer, director, and author. He was one of the last living people of the film industry’s Golden Age. After an impoverished childhood with immigrant parents and six sisters, he had his film debut in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s and 1960s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war movies. During his career he appeared in more than 90 movies. Douglas was well known for his explosive acting style. As an actor and philanthropist, Douglas had received three Academy Award nominations, an Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As an author, he had written ten novels and memoirs. He was No. 17 on the American Film Institute’s list of the greatest male screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema, and the highest-ranked living person on the list. After barely surviving a helicopter crash in 1991 and then suffering a stroke in 1996, he had focused on renewing his spiritual and religious life. He lived with his second wife (of 63 years), Anne Buydens, a producer. He was to turn 101 on December 9, 2016.	Scott Walker, Mary Burke draw sharp contrast on expanding vouchers	false
80462bce	High earners in professional jobs, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, are much more likely to be regular alcohol drinkers than those on average incomes, according to the latest official figures. The data from two reports shows that people earning more than £40,000 a year like their wine, beer or whisky, and can afford it. Four out of five 79% in England said they had drunk alcohol in the previous week – a question used to measure drinking habits in surveys – compared with 58% of all adults. Drinking rises steadily with socioeconomic status: people whose work is classified as routine and manual, including labourers, receptionists and care workers, were the least likely to have had alcohol in the week before they were asked. The reports come from NHS Digital England only and the Office for National Statistics. The ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey shows that in Great Britain in 2017, an estimated 29.2 million adults said they had drunk alcohol in the week before they were asked. England had the highest proportion of adults who said they drank alcohol in the previous week 57.8%, followed by Scotland 53.5% and then Wales 50.0%; of the English regions, among consumers of alcohol, binge drinking was more common in the north-west and least common in the south-east. How much people drink varies with age. A fifth of people said they did not drink at all. They were most likely to be between 25 and 64. Those most likely to drink were over 65. When the young drink, they are the most likely to binge on Friday and Saturday nights and then not drink for the rest of the week. Data from previous years in the Health Survey for England showed the most harmful drinking was among middle-aged people, who were more likely to drink every day. “Middle-class drinkers are unlikely to pay attention to government health warnings as they may be less likely to get excessively drunk, and can withstand increases in prices,” said Steve Clarke, an alcohol addiction therapy services manager with the Priory Group. “The over-45s particularly are drinking more regularly but not thinking they’re in danger. But they are drinking four, five, six days a week and it all adds up. In 2016-17 [in England] there were 337,000 estimated hospital admissions attributable to alcohol – that’s a jump of 17%, nearly a fifth, on 2006-07,” he said. The data was published on Tuesday, the day Scotland introduces minimum unit pricing after a long fight with the alcohol industry, which challenged its legality in the courts. The ONS findings support other evidence that price is a big factor in people’s drinking habits. Campaigners and experts hope minimum unit pricing will lead people, especially the most vulnerable, to forgo the strongest drinks because they will become more expensive. They are lobbying for England to follow Scotland’s example. “The Westminster government should now follow Scotland’s lead and introduce MUP in England,” said Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 50 organisations. “Cheap alcohol is wrecking lives and livelihoods in England as well as Scotland. There are more than 23,000 deaths a year in England linked to alcohol, and many of these come from the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society.” He added: “Minimum unit pricing will save lives, cut crime and benefit the public finances. At the same time, pub prices will be left untouched, and moderate drinkers will barely notice the difference under MUP. “Any delay in implementing MUP in England will only cost lives and lead to unnecessary alcohol-related harm. We urge the Westminster government to act now.” Minimum unit pricing sets the lowest price at which a unit of alcohol can be sold, which in Scotland is now 50p. A pint of beer containing two units will now have to cost at least £1, and a bottle of wine containing nine units will have to cost at least £4.50. But the biggest impact will be on the very strong ciders and other strong alcoholic drinks that have been very cheap and are often bought by alcoholics.

48eec6b0	The number of white suspected terrorists being arrested in the UK has overtaken those of Asian appearance for the first time in more than a decade. Statistics released by the Home Office show an overall fall in terror arrests of 22 per cent in the year, with 351 made in the 12 months to the end of June. “The fall is partly due to a relatively large number of arrests being made following terrorist attacks in London and Manchester last year,” a report said. White suspects accounted for 38 per cent of terror-related arrests, followed by those of Asian appearance on 37 per cent and black suspects on 9 per cent. “This was the first time, since the year ending June 2005, that the proportion of white people arrested has exceeded the proportion of Asian people arrested,” the report said. “It was the second highest number of arrests of white people in a year since the data collection began in 2001.” The demographics of terrorists in prison, where Islamists make up the majority, is also changing, as the number of far-right extremists jailed rises.

Read our privacy notice The Home Office said: “The number of Islamist, extremist prisoners saw a slight decrease for the first time. ✕ Isis fighters in Afghanistan are communicating with UK terror cells, defence secretary Gavin Williamson says “The proportion of prisoners holding far-right ideologies has increased steadily over the past three years, with the number up from 10 to 28 in the latest year.” Terror arrests have risen significantly since Isis declared its so-called “state” across Syria and Iraq, causing at least 900 people to leave the UK for its territories and others, who remained in the country, arrested for raising money for the group, spreading its propaganda and planning to commit attacks. Then in 2016, National Action became the first far-right group to ever be declared a terrorist organisation in the UK, with waves of police raids targeting the neo-Nazis. Experts have warned of the threat of “reciprocal radicalisation”, where Islamists and the far-right feed off each other to drive support to their own ideologies. Since the Westminster attack in March 2017, security services have foiled 13 Islamist plots and four from the extreme right-wing, seeing numerous would-be killers jailed. Of the five attacks launched in London and Manchester last year, leaving a total of 36 victims dead, Isis claimed responsibility for four and one was carried out by a far-right extremist targeting Muslims. Islamists make up 82 per cent of terrorist prisoners, followed by 13 per cent far-right and the rest made up of other ideologies including links to Northern Ireland. Police leaders said the past year saw highest number of terrorists tried and successfully convicted, since data collection began in 2009. Life sentences were handed out in 10 cases, including for the men who mounted the Finsbury Park and Parsons Green terror attacks.

The number of active investigations being carried out by specialist police and the security services has reached it’s highest ever level, currently standing at more than 650 probes focusing on the “most dangerous individuals”. “Demands upon CT Policing have increased by about a third since the start of 2017,” said deputy assistant commissioner Haydon. “The step-change in terrorist activity is matched only by an increased effort from police and security services, and our officers are working incredibly hard to protect the public and to bring people to justice, which is evidenced by the impressive conviction rate achieved in the last year. “But I would also like to use this opportunity to remind the public that they, too, play a part in these successes. “Many of these arrests, convictions and investigations hinge upon vital information provided by members of the public.” The figures came as the government consults on new terror laws contained in the Counter Terrorism and Border Security Bill. If enacted, it could spark a dramatic increase in terror arrests, which are currently being made under two Terrorism Acts, by introducing new crimes. They include viewing terrorist propaganda online just once, entering “designated areas” abroad, and making “reckless” statements that could drive support for a banned group. People are urged to report suspicious activity online at www.gov.uk/ACT or via the confidential hotline on 0800 789 321.	The global land and ocean temperature departure from average for May 2018 was the fourth highest for the month of May in the NOAA global temperature dataset record, which dates back to 1880. The March-May and year-to-date global temperatures were also the fourth warmest such periods on record.This monthly summary, developed by scientists at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, is part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides to government, business, academia and the public to support informed decision-making. May 2018 Temperature The May temperature across global land and ocean surfaces was 1.44°F above the 20th century average of 58.6°F and the fourth highest for May in the 1880-2018 record. The years 2014-2018 rank among the five warmest Mays on record, with 2016 the warmest May at 1.58°F above average. May 2018 also marks the 42nd consecutive May and the 401st consecutive month with temperatures, at least nominally, above the 20th century average. Record warmth was observed across parts of North America., Europe and Asia as well as the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Record cold May temperatures were limited to northeastern Canada and the northern Atlantic Ocean, off the southern coast of Greenland. The May globally averaged land surface temperature was 2.05°F above the 20th century average of 52.0°F. This value was the smallest May temperature departure from average since 2011 and tied with 2013 as the seventh highest May land temperature in the 139-year record. The most notable warm land temperature departures from average during May 2018 were present across much of the contiguous U.S. and Europe, where temperatures were 5.4°F above average or higher. In contrast, the most notable cool land temperature departures from average were present across northeastern Canada and central Russia where temperatures were 5.4°F below average or lower. Europe had its warmest May since continental records began in 1910 at 4.97°F above average, surpassing the previous record set in 2003 by 1.66°F. May 2018 marked the first time in May that the continental temperature departure from average was 3.6°F (2.0°C) or higher. Several European countries had a record or near-record warm May temperature. Asia had its smallest May temperature departure from average since 2009. The May globally averaged sea surface temperature was 1.19°F above the 20th century monthly average of 61.3°F – also the fourth highest global ocean temperature for May in the record. The years 2014-2018 rank among the five warmest Mays on record, with 2016 the warmest May at 1.39°F above average. May 2018 Sea Ice. The May average Arctic sea ice extent was the second smallest in the 40-year record at 420,000 square miles (8.1 percent) below the 1981-2010 average, according to an analysis by the National Snow and Ice Data Center(link is external) using data from NOAA and NASA. Only the May Arctic sea ice extent in 2016 was smaller. The near-record low Arctic sea ice extent was mostly due to much-below-average sea ice in the Bering and Chukchi Seas. Antarctic sea ice extent during May was 330,000 square miles (8.6 percent) below the 1981-2010 average, the third smallest May extent on record. Antarctic sea ice expanded at a rate faster than average during May, with below-average ice coverage continuing for parts of the Weddell Sea. Seasonal (March-May 2018). The March-May average temperature across global land and ocean surfaces was 1.48°F above the 20th century average of 56.7°F and the fourth highest for March-May in the 1880-2018 record. This value was 0.45°F cooler than the record high set in 2016 and was the smallest March-May temperature departure from average since 2014. Record warm temperatures during the three-month period were present across parts of southern Europe, the Middle East, northeastern Africa, China, Mongolia, South America and the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. No land or ocean areas had record cold temperatures during March-May 2018. The globally averaged land surface temperature for March-May was 2.34°F above the 20th century average of 46.4°F. This value was the the fifth highest for March-May in the 139-year record. Five continents had a March-May 2018 temperature that ranked among the nine warmest such period since continental records began in 1910. Of note, Europe and South America had their third warmest March-May on record. The March-May globally averaged sea surface temperature was 1.15°F above the 20th century average of 61.0°F – also the fourth highest for March-May in the record. Year-to-Date (January-May 2018). The year-to-date temperature across global land and ocean surfaces was 1.39°F above the 20th century average of 55.5°F – tying with 2010 as the fourth highest for January-May in the 139-year record. The 2018 year-to-date value was 0.59°F lower than the record high set in 2016. The year-to-date globally averaged land surface temperature was 2.18°F above the 20th century average of 42.8°F. This value tied with 2002 as the fifth highest for January-May in the record. The year-to-date globally averaged sea surface temperature was 1.08°F above the 20th century average of 60.8°F. This was also the fifth highest for January-May in the 1880-2018 record.	true
238ef94f	Following the recent resignation of Director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub Jr., the Trump Administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: White House Chef Lisa Mead. Mead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasn’t utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House. “It’s kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef,” said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. “But Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal he’s eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President’s ice cream from the carton.” Mr. Trump’s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President’s eating habits to the press. “It’s borderline creepy,” the staffer said. “The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he’s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It’s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.” Mr. Trump’s McDonalds habits are even weirder. “He orders the same thing every time,” said the staffer. “He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M’s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up.” No wonder Chef Lisa Mead quit. The Halfway Post wishes her good luck on her future endeavors. (Photo courtesy of Shelby Bell.)

28ee11a1	"By The Journal Sentinel's Guy Boulton wrote this Jan. 1 in describing Obamacare's health insurance exchanges: ""The exchanges could help consumers and small businesses compare competing health plans"" and ""they also could increase price competition by requiring health insurers to offer more standardized plans and by providing consumers with better information about what they are buying."" Private-sector free-market insurance exchanges already exist without government intervention or taxpayer subsidies. If you Google ""health insurance quote,"" you will find a number of options. There are dozens of companies and hundreds of plan choices with a wide range of monthly costs depending on plan design. I used one of these to purchase insurance for my family, and millions of other people have used them as well. They work without government involvement. The real reason government-run exchanges are being created is to expand Medicaid and government-subsidized insurance. How will income or family size be verified on a website? This concept is ripe for fraud and abuse. And the subsidies are so generous that families of four making as much as $89,000 will be eligible for taxpayer subsidies. Our nation cannot afford this expensive program. Our country is overspending at a rapid and unsustainable rate of $1.3 trillion more than tax revenue annually. The federal debt is $15 trillion (and growing) and now is more than the annual Gross Domestic Product. When we are broke and overspending, it doesn't make sense to subsidize 75% of the people of Mississippi or more than half of those with private insurance in Wisconsin. Those pressing for a state or federal health insurance exchange in Wisconsin have misled people by telling them it will produce cost savings for both consumers and taxpayers. A government exchange will increase costs substantially both for consumers and taxpayers. Those saying otherwise may have their own interests at heart but certainly not those of Wisconsin and its citizens. A million-dollar study commissioned by the administration of former Gov. Jim Doyle told us that after Obamacare, nearly 90% of people with insurance will have their costs go up by more than 30%. Because of Obamacare, about 100,000 Wisconsinites will lose the private insurance they have now and will be forced to purchase new insurance. Finally, the U.S. Supreme Court may overturn Obamacare, and the elections in November may result in repeal or reform of the law. Government exchanges don't have to be active until January 2014. There is plenty of time for the state to act after the Supreme Court and the voters have weighed in. Many other states are waiting for the outcome of the Supreme Court and elections. True free-market exchanges do exist, and the competition they generate yields positive results. A government-run Obamacare exchange is deceptive, ill-conceived and an expensive government expansion that our nation cannot afford at this time or in the near future. Remember, the vast majority of citizens have the best health care in the world. Truly poor people already have Medicaid (free taxpayer-paid health care), and older folks have Medicare. The provisions of Obamacare will only increase both insurance and taxpayer costs. Wisconsin should not participate in this costly federal program until the last possible moment. State Sen. Frank Lasee (R-De Pere) represents the 1st Senate District."	Redrawn Senate map passes House, scramble for seats begin	false
74adcdf1	David Cameron today insisted that a 'few extra bombs and missiles' will not transform the situation in Syria, but pushed for Britain to join airstrikes against ISIS. The Prime Minister said it makes no sense that the RAF must respect an international border no longer recognised by jihadi fanatics plotting attacks on the UK. France, which last night launched a series of 'massive' air strikes on ISIS in Syria, has said it would be 'appreciated' if Britain joined the fight. But Mr Cameron warned he has yet to persuade enough MPs to ensure a vote on military action was not defeated by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who today said it could bring 'more mayhem and more loss'. RAF Tornados are carrying out bombing raids against ISIS in Iraq but David Cameron has yet to build support in Parliament for military action in neighbouring Syria Speaking at a press conference at the G20 summit in Turkey, David Cameron today insisted that a 'few extra bombs and missiles' will not transform the situation in Syria In the wake of the deadly gun and bomb attacks in Paris, 10 French jets dropped 20 bombs on the ISIS capital of Raqqa, destroying a key command centre, training camp and munitions dump and throwing the city into panic. The bombardment came just two days after President Francois Hollande said the co-ordinated attacks in Paris that killed up to 129 people was an 'act of war' and vowed to strike ISIS in Syria 'without mercy'. The jets launched from sites in Jordan and the Persian Gulf, in coordination with U.S. forces. France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said his country was justified in taking action in Syria. 'It was normal to take the initiative and action and France had the legitimacy to do so. We did it already in the past, we have conducted new airstrikes in Raqqa today, Fabius said. 'One cannot be attacked harshly, and you know the drama that is happening in Paris, without being present and active.' However, Britain is not taking part in the action in Syria because MPs have so far refused to authorise the extension of airstrikes in neighbouring Iraq. Mr Cameron was humiliated in 2013 when Tory rebels joined with Labour to vote down a plan to launch missile strikes against the Assad regime. There is a very strong case for saying Isil doesn't stop at the Iraq/Syria border and therefore neither should we Prime Minister David Cameron It forced the PM into an embarrassing retreat and damaged relations with US President Barack Obama who had to go it alone in sending jets into Syrian airspace. However, public outrage at the Paris attacks and the wider refugee crisis fuelled by the rise of ISIS has put the issue back on the table. Speaking at a press conference at the G20 summit in Turkey, Mr Cameron said: 'There is a very strong case for saying Isil doesn't stop at the Iraq/Syria border and therefore neither should we, but I recognise that I need to do more to build this argument, build this case, to take Parliament with me. 'I think people want to know that there is a whole plan for the future of Syria, the future of the region, because it is perfectly right to say that a few extra bombs and missiles won't transform the situation. 'As the secretary-general of the United Nations put it a few years ago: 'A missile can kill a terrorist, but it is good government and good governance that can kill terrorism'. That is what we need.' David Cameron, who today met Russian President Vladimir Putin to push for a political solution to the crisis in Syria, warned it makes no sense not to extend the strikes across a border which ISIS itself does not recognise Mr Cameron has repeatedly made clear he believes it makes no sense not to extend the strikes across a border which ISIS itself does not recognise. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I support the action in Syria. We are part of the enablers for that. It is happening anyway. The question is should we go further in joining that action. 'I've always said I think it is sensible that we should. ISIL does not recognise a border between Iraq and Syria and neither should we. 'But I need to build the argument. I need to take it to Parliament. I need to convince more people.' He insisted that British 'military hard power' was already having an effect in Iraq, where ISIS has 'lost about 25 to 30 per cent of the territory that they held'. UK military forces including drones had also been used to help find, target and kill leading ISIS fighters posing a direct threat to Britain, including former Cardiff schoolboy Reyaad Khan, killed by a British drone in Syria in August. British intelligence planes were also involved in the mission to trace ISIS murderer Jihadi John, who was killed by an American drone strike on Thursday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn warned that increased military action was not the solution to the crisis, and ruled out giving his MPs a free vote on military intervention LABOUR WILL NOT GET A FREE VOTE ON BOMBING ISIS IN SYRIA Jeremy Corbyn faces a challenge from his own MPs over military action in Syria after he ruled out allowing a free vote on bombing the ISIS stronghold. The Labour leader told Sky News: I’m hoping we will be able to come to that position in agreement, actually with a number of other Conservatives, so that is indeed the position I’m putting forward. I don’t think a free vote is something that we’re offering. It puts him on collision course with dozens of Labour MPs who privately think Britain should step up its involvement. Chris Leslie, former shadow chancellor, said: 'We shouldn't pre-empt any proposal about how to tackle the ISIS threat or rule anything out at this stage, surely?' Advertisement But Mr Cameron insisted he would not force a vote in the Commons on action in Syria unless he was sure he could win. 'We won't hold that vote unless we can see that Parliament would endorse that action because to fail on this would be damaging - it's not a question of damaging the government, its a question of not damaging our country and its reputation in the world. 'So I will build the case but in the end Parliament must decide. 'I have made the promise to Parliament as previous prime ministers have done that we won't commit to military action in a premeditate way without having a vote. 'Of course I think the British military would bring greater effect to what's happening in Syria. 'What we should be doing as well as building the argument doesn't stop at the Iraq-Syria border is we should be pushing for this political settlement which in the end is going to be the way that gives us a government in Syria that can represent all of the Syrian people and be our ally in wiping out the scourge of Islamist terror that is leading to the loss of life in our own countries and the Middle East.' However the Tory government the faces opposition from both Labour and dozens of Conservative MPs. Labour leader Mr Corbyn warned that increased military action was not the solution to the crisis. He told ITV's Lorraine: 'Does the bombing change it? Probably not. The idea has to be, surely, a political settlement in Syria, very difficult to achieve. 'There are some signs that the talks over the weekend have made some progress - Iran, Russia, USA, European Union, around a table together with all the regional governments, particularly Turkey is key. 'But also, who's funding ISIS, who is arming ISIS, who's providing safe havens for ISIS to get there. 'You have to ask questions about the arms that everyone has sold in the region, the role of Saudi Arabia in this, I think there are some very big questions and we have to be careful. One war doesn't necessarily bring about peace, it often can bring yet more conflict and more mayhem and more loss.' France's ambassador to the UK Sylvie Bermann has said it would be 'appreciated' if the RAF carried out raids in Syria alongside the French. She told Murnaghan: 'It is difficult to comment because it is not only a Government decision but they have decided to consult with the Parliament. If they do participate like us, of course we will appreciate it because we have always fought side by side but it is their decision.' She added: 'We have to fight side by side if we want to defeat terrorism. ' Former prime minister Tony Blair called for Britain to join airstrikes in Syria last week, before the Paris attacks: 'It's no great secret; I think it is essential for Britain to play its part in the fight against this hideous extremism that is brutalising the lives of so many people.' One of the ten French fighter jets prepares to take off from an airbase in the United Arab Emirates French fighter jets launch a wave of 'massive' air strikes on ISIS in Syria as the country started its 'pitiless' retribution for the Paris attacks SEVEN ATTACKS FOILED IN THE LAST YEAR AS 1,900 SPIES HIRED Britain is to recruit an extra 1,900 spies to counter the threat posed by ISIS terror cells in Syria. David Cameron today revealed seven deadly plots to cause havoc in the UK have been disrupted in the last 12 months. But he warned that the scale and severity of the attacks in Paris which left 129 people dead were far greater than anything seen by intelligence agencies to date. The security and intelligence services will receive a major increase in funding in response to the ISIS threat, which has been blamed for the bombing of a Russian airliner in Egypt and the Paris attack in recent weeks. Mr Cameron announced a 15 per cent increase in the 12,700-strong staff of the security and intelligence agencies MI5, MI6 and GCHQ with the recruitment of an additional 1,900 personnel. Meanwhile spending on aviation security will increase to at least double the current £9million a year. The Prime Minister said the UK was engaged in a 'generational struggle' against extremist terror. The additional spending will help 'combat those who would destroy us and our values' and allow Britons to 'continue with our way of life we hold so dear'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I have been aware of these cells operating in Syria that are radicalising people in our own country, potentially sending people back to carry out attacks. 'Our security services have stopped seven attacks in the last six months, albeit on a smaller scale.' Downing Street later clarified that the figure was for the last year. Plans for how to respond to a Paris-style marauding gun attack have been reviewed in the wake of the Paris atrocity, which marked a change in the nature of ISIS plots. 'It could've happened here,' Mr Cameron said. 'We stand in total solidarity with France after the appalling attacks in Paris. Advertisement Tory MP Crispin Blunt, the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, said an RAF bombing campaign in Syria would be an 'ineffective move' because 'it wouldn't be part of a coherent international plan to achieve our mission which is the defeat of Isis'. Mr Blunt told Sky News: 'Whether or not eight British aeroplanes should fly slightly wider air operations is not going to change anything militarily, the French are already flying there, the Americans are already flying the vast number of the missions there alongside now the Russians as well. 'Making that picture slightly more complex is not actually going to change the outcome and what we've got to do here is to focus on the outcome. What's the mission? The mission is to defeat Isis, we're not going to defeat the ideology immediately, that's going to take a much longer time but it's much easier to make sure that we can't have attacks projected on us such as the ones we've had in Paris if Isis does not control territory and there is nowhere for people to go, of whatever type, to go and fight for them. 'That territory has got to be taken off them, we've got to have an agreement about how to do that.' Labour under Mr Corbyn has vowed to oppose any extension of British involvement, calling for a 'peaceful' solution to the conflict. However the hardline stance risks putting him increasingly at odds with voters appalled at the Paris attacks. Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn told Sky News that it was not possible 'to defeat Isil in Syria just by dropping bombs'. Shadow international development secretary Diane Abbott said Labour will only consent to extending military action into Syria if there is a UN mandate to do so. Speaking in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, the shadow international development secretary Diane Abbott, outlined the circumstances which will be required for her party to back a bid to extend the UK's military role from Iraq and into Syria. She told Murnaghan on Sky News: 'As far as Labour's policy in relation to Syria, we actually discussed this at party conference and we have a policy. 'We can only agree to bomb in Syria first of all if there is a UN resolution and also, and this is my particular concern, if there is a plan to deal with the refugees that will result from further military action.' When asked if the Paris attacks had changed any of that, Ms Abbott said: 'Yes, it is a game changer in that it makes the need to resolve the civil war in Syria even more urgent than it was and that's part of Labour party's policy, that we put the need for a diplomatic solution to the Syrian civil war right at the top of the agenda.'

d1741354	News| [email protected] “If you won’t lead, then step aside. I will.” January 29, 2020 – On Monday, federal prosecutors charged former state Sen. Martin Sandoval with accepting a bribe in exchange for opposing legislation that would harm the red-light camera industry. They also charged him with one count of filing a false income tax return. Silent Sean Casten, once again, failed to stand up to his party bosses in Illinois. Just as he refused to stand up to Mike Madigan and his cronies when it was learned that they allegedy covered up a rape and fostered a culture of abuse in Springfield, Casten has said nothing about Marty Sandoval’s bribery changes. When Sandoval staged a mock assassination of the President at a fundraiser in the 6th district, Casten said nothing. Yet, he demanded the impeachment of the Republican President before the Mueller report was even released. And he couldn’t have been quicker to hype the impeachment of Conservative Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on completely bogus allegations. Then, Casten turns around and tells a group of voters, “Because we are still a nation where the majority of people voted for Hillary Clinton, we are still a nation where the majority are good people.” Hillary Clinton’s career is easily one of the most well-documented cases of political corruption in American History. “Now, I understand Sean Casten may feel a little sheepish commenting on another Democrat’s tax fraud, since it was recently revealed that Casten himself was committing tax fraud,” said Jeanne Ives. “Ignoring corruption and refusing to use your platform to expose wrong-doing might keep you in favor with party bosses, but it also makes you complicit in your party’s culture of abuse. Worse still, going after the wrong-doings of your political opponents with the energy of 1,000 solar-powered windmills, while ignoring the serious problems in your own party, makes you a bitter partisan.” As a state representative, Ives spoke out against Speaker Madigan’s culture of cronyism and abuse. But she also stood up to Republican when they passed unbalanced budgets, tax hikes and crony bailouts. “As a legislator, you are trusted to stand up for the people you represent against increasingly powerful politicians and party leaders,” said Ives. “This is your party now, Sean Casten. You have the power stand up to the corruption right in front of you, and you refuse to do it. If you won’t lead, then step aside. I will.” ### For more information or to book Jeanne Ives, contact Kathleen Murphy at 630-329-4680 or [email protected]	IT'S OFFICIAL: Brexit Britain WILL thrive out of EU as our economy SURGES ahead	false
b4b6057f	"SHARE Madison - Gov. Scott Walker's proposal to increase funding for voucher and public charter schools as well as his plan to create a new stream of funding to allow special-needs children to attend private schools drew immediate criticism Sunday from the state's largest teacher union, public school advocates and a major disability rights group. According to funding proposals unveiled by the governor's office Sunday, Walker is making money available that could be used as incentive payments for teachers and schools based on how well schools perform on state report cards. Walker will propose a modest increase - roughly 1% - in funding for Wisconsin public schools in his budget to the Legislature on Wednesday, two years after his steep cuts and all but elimination of collective bargaining for teachers sparked the unsuccessful movement to recall Walker from office. Tom Beebe, project director for Opportunity to Learn Wisconsin, a liberal-leaning group and former executive director of the Wisconsin Alliance for Excellent Schools, has been critical of Walker's cuts to education. He said the amount of general aid increase proposed for this next biennial budget - $129.2 million over two years - only amounts to about $161 for each of Wisconsin's 800,000 public-school students. ""If the revenue cap does not go up, then there is no new money going to schools no matter how much aid increases,"" Beebe said. ""The increase in school funding simply goes to property-tax payers, not into the classroom."" Mary Bell, president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the state's largest teacher union, said the modest increase was really just keeping overall revenue for schools flat. ""The stagnant revenue on top of the largest cuts to education funding in Wisconsin history in the last budget is another clear indication that this governor has no intention of supporting neighborhood schools,"" Bell said in a statement. ""(Walker's) real focus is privatizing public education with another infusion of resources to the unaccountable taxpayer-funded private school voucher program while leaving our neighborhood public schools on life support,"" she added. The Republican-controlled Legislature will review Walker's budget over the next four months and make changes before voting on it sometime in June. The two-year spending plan takes effect in July. State Rep. Sondy Pope, ranking Democrat on the Assembly's Education Committee, said Walker's proposal isn't enough. At the rate of state aid funding for public schools, it would take 12 years to replace the money lost in the last budget, she said. Walker contends schools have been able to save money because the collective bargaining law also required teachers to contribute more toward their pension and health care benefits. The nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance reported in November that those cuts in benefits and limiting union-negotiated raises to the rate of inflation offset about two-thirds of the reductions in school revenue in the 2011-'12 academic year. Pope said the increase in aid Walker is proposing won't be enough to help schools struggling to make ends meet. ""These people are trying to starve Wisconsin public schools,"" she said. Republican Sen. Luther Olsen, chairman of the Senate's Education Committee, said he was glad to see Walker putting more money into public education. ""It's a lot better than having to cut like we did in the last budget,"" he said. ""It's not as much as I wanted, but we're glad it's not negative or zero."" Walker's funding for schools includes $73 million more for voucher schools, $23 million for charter schools, and $21 million in grants for special-needs students to receive a voucher to attend private schools. A proposal for those special-needs vouchers passed the Assembly last session, despite broad opposition from the state Department of Public Instruction, disabilities rights groups, and the state school boards association. It did not pass the Senate. Lisa Pugh, public policy coordinator for Disability Rights Wisconsin, expressed concern that special-needs vouchers were now being proposed as part of the budget, because it would be a significant policy change in the way students with special needs are served. And that should be debated in education legislative committees, she said. Also, the $21 million for special-needs children could have been applied to help public schools across the state, not just for the minority of children who could use that taxpayer subsidy to attend a private school, she said. Walker's plans for expanding the more well-known voucher system encompassing Milwaukee's long-standing program and Racine's new program are highly anticipated, but he did not immediately provide those details. Funding for the UW System would go up $181 million under the budget, two years after it was cut by $315 million. Technical college aid would increase $5 million. UW spokesman David Giroux said the increased funding, coupled with the university being exempted from so-called lapses that could have resulted in $66 million in cuts, was ""very positive."" ""We want to create a stronger workforce for Wisconsin, and new taxpayer investments are essential to that effort,"" Giroux said. ""It looks like we will have enough funding to preserve today's levels of college access and quality, along with new investments in UW programs focused on job creation. That's a smart investment."" Walker is making $64 million available in incentive payments for K-12 schools, tied to their grades on statewide report cards. Of that, $24 million would go to schools with an A or B grade, $30 million would go to schools that show a certain level of improvement on the report cards and $10 million would be available to the lowest-performing districts for a one-time grant if they provide an acceptable improvement plan. Brian Pleva, lobbyist for the American Federation for Children Wisconsin, a conservative group, praised Walker's increase for voucher- and charter-school funding because it would give low-income and middle-class parents more educational choices. He also said that special-needs scholarships would help a minority of families for which local public schools aren't meeting their children's needs. Walker said in a statement Sunday that the budget proposals will reward successes and provide incentives to schools to drive achievement and accountability. In this next biennial budget, total K-12 funding would go up $276 million, according to the AP. But Walker will not lift the lid on revenue limits, saying he was concerned about moves that might cause property taxes to increase. The proposed increase in aid to schools comes after Walker cut general school aid by $834 million two years ago, a more than 8% drop from the previous funding period. To restrict school boards from raising property taxes to replace the drop in school aid, the governor proposed reducing districts' revenue limit authority - the combined amount they're able to raise in local property taxes and state general school aid - by 5.5%. As a result, the average school per-pupil revenue limit dropped about $555 in 2011-'12, from $10,100 in 2010-'11.

17717174	Elisa Granato, the first volunteer who availed herself in Oxford for a jab in the first Europe human trial of a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus pandemic has died. She died two days after the vaccine was administered, authorities have said and added that an investigation into the cause of the death has been initiated. A statement by the researchers said Elisa had complications few hours after taking the vaccine and died while on admission. Elisa Granato, who is a scientist, was one of the two who received the jab.

25aa97f1	"Many Democrats are crowing that the 82nd Legislature will go down as one in which, despite the ""emergency"" push for sanctuary cities legislation, nothing emerged from the Capitol that waill substantially alter the way immigration laws are enforced. Yet Republicans did manage to eke out one small victory during the special session, successfully attaching language to Senate Bill 1, the must-pass fiscal matters bill, that would require people applying for driver's licenses or other state-issued identification cards to prove they're in the country legally. Such a policy, as opposed to a law on the books, had been in effect since 2008, when the Texas Department of Public Safety began requiring applicants for driver’s licenses and ID cards to produce government-issued documents that affirmed their legal status. Before 2008, according to DPS spokeswoman Tela Mange, such proof was not required to obtain a license or ID. Immigrants' rights groups were irate over the policy change, which they alleged could have the effect of denying legal residents access to those forms of ID, with DPS clerks acting as de facto immigration agents. In 2009, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund sued DPS, arguing that the agency overstepped its authority by implementing the policy even though the Legislature rejected similar legislation in the 2007 session. Last month, however, House Appropriations Chairman Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, took matters into his own hands. Pitts cribbed language requiring applicants for driver's licenses and ID cards to prove their legal residency from Senate Bill 9, an omnibus homeland security bill filed by state Sen. Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands, and added it as an amendment to SB 1. The amendment also allows the DPS to determine expiration dates for those IDs based on when an immigration document was issued. For a non-citizen or non-permanent legal resident, DPS can issue a document that “expires on the earlier of a date specified by DPS or the expiration date of the applicant's authorized stay in the United States.” If the immigration document does not have an expiration date, DPS can issue an ID or license that expires every year. During the just-concluded regular and special sessions, Williams argued that Texas was only one of three states that didn’t have a policy regarding legal status for ID applicants and said one was necessary to ensure that foreign criminals were not receiving IDs. He noted that, as part of an appropriation of $64 million over the next biennium for temporary visitors stations, DPS staff will be trained to identify and approve the dozens of immigration documents currently used to apply for driver's licenses and IDs. People attempting to renew their exisiting licenses or IDs but don't have immediate access to passports or birth certificates could also be impacted by the new law, Mange said. The Pitts amendment requires that they provide DPS with proof of residency or citizenship as well. Mange said the agency ""may have"" something in its files indicating that an applicant has previously produced such proof, but if it was before 2008, she said, ""you may want to bring something just in case."" Mange said that Texans should receive a notice from DPS when it's time to renew that will inform them whether they're eligible to renew online, which can only happen if they didn't renew online the previous time. ""We require everyone to come in once every 12 years so we can see your smiling face,"" she said. The Legislature’s actions could signal an end to the 2009 court case. Still, MALDEF attorney Luis Figueroa questions the timing of the Pitts amenemnt, which coincides with the passage of a new Voter ID law requiring citizens to show a valid state-issued ID before casting a ballot. Democrats and advocacy groups, including MALDEF, rallied against the Voter ID measure during the session, claiming it would decrease turnout at a time when Texas already ranks near the bottom of all states in ballot-box participation. During the Voter ID debate, Democrats charged the law would make it difficult, in particular, for senior citizens who haven't had a picture ID in years to vote. “If [voters] are trying at the last minute to get a driver’s license and trying to get the documents they need and they are rejected, it’s going to make the process slower,” Figueroa said. Aides to both Pitts and state Rep. Charlie Geren, R-Fort Worth, who worked with the Senate to attach the amendment to SB 1, said they were unaware of those concerns. They noted a majority of Senate Democrats voted for SB 9 during the regular session, when it contained the driver's license/ID provision. But Geren expressed some displeasure this week that the driver’s license language made it on to the fiscal matters bill while “sanctuary cities” language — which would prohibit local entities from adopting policies that prevent the enforcement of state and federal immigration laws — did not. Failure to pass a sanctuary cities bill, which Gov. Rick Perry declared an emergency item during the regular session and added to the special-session call, resulted a round of finger-pointing by the House and Senate. The House, which approved a bill in the regular session, blamed the Senate for not following suit. The Senate, which passed a bill in the special session, blamed the House for failing even to move it out of committee in the special. Perry then blamed state Sen. Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock who chaired the SB 1 conference committee, for refusing to add sanctuary cities to the committee's report. “They were several interviews [in which] some of the senators said that SB9 did not belong in SB1,” an animated Geren said. “Well, they sure as hell wanted this part of SB9 in SB1.”"	Kremlin: German Clinic's Diagnosis of Navalny's Condition Doesn't Show He Was Definitely Poisoned	partially false
88a75bcc	A 30-year old man from Kentucky underwent some radical plastic surgery in order to physically resemble Jesus Christ. According to the Lexington Daily Tribune, Mark Emery has already been following Jesus’ footsteps in many different ways for several years, becoming a carpenter himself, as well as studying ancient Jewish law and religious texts. He went so far as to spend more than $215,000 on two years worth of plastic surgery to change his physical appearance to resemble Jesus. After undergoing a total of 21 surgical interventions, he claims to be “almost satisfied” with the results. “Some people buy fancy cars or fancy mansions… I use my money to show my love for Jesus by getting surgery to look more like him,” says Mr. Emery. “I try to live by his example and to be as much like him as I can. For me, acting like Jesus wasn’t enough, I really wanted to be like him and look like him.” The young man used various images and icons in order to determine the actual appearance of Christ before beginning his various surgeries. Many critics have already arisen in the social media, both denouncing or mocking Mr. Emery’s attempt to resemble Jesus Christ. Hundreds of people, including various religious leaders, have made some religiously oriented critics, denouncing as “blasphemy” or “heresy” his desire to physically imitate the appearance of Christ. “Christians love Jesus and try to act like him, not look like him. Shame on you. That’s ridiculous and anti-Christian” wrote Pastor John Hagee on his Twitter account. Many critics have also described Mr. Emery’s surgery as “ridiculous” since the physical appearance of Jesus Christ remains unclear and is still subject to a lot of debate. A special on PBS special put together a large study to determine what Jesus must have looked like, and this is the result they obtained. The Bible itself gives no physical description of Jesus in the sense of describing his skin tone, hair style, or facial traits. Many theories have been elaborated by scholars over the years, some of them incredibly far-fetched, claiming that Jesus could have been West African, Egyptian or half-Roman among others, but none of these claims were backed on any proof. It is generally accepted among historians, that Jesus was not of European descent, as he is usually depicted on icons and crucifixes. He would instead have resembled a modern-day Arab, Turk or other middle eastern man, having a slightly darker skin color. Despite all these critics, Mr. Emery says that he is really happy with the results of his surgery, claiming that he now feels closer to Jesus than he had ever felt in his life.	Months after being denied media credentials for the Texas House, the conservative organization Texas Scorecard — a product of Empower Texans, a Tea Party-aligned political advocacy group with one of the state’s best-funded political action committees — has filed a First Amendment lawsuit arguing that its rejection from the lower chamber constitutes “unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.” Before the legislative session kicked off in January, two employees of Texas Scorecard, Brandon Waltens and Destin Sensky, applied for media credentials in both chambers of the Legislature. In the Senate, their credentials were granted; in the House, they were denied. The two chambers follow similar rules about who is allowed special journalistic access to the floor, and both prohibit lobbyists. But the chambers’ political atmospheres are different. House Administration Chair Charlie Geren, a Fort Worth Republican who has sparred with Empower Texans and its PAC in the past, told the group in a January rejection letter that it was ineligible for media credentials because “the organization you are employed by, Texas Scorecard, has a close association with a general-purpose political committee (GPAC) and that the organization’s website prominently displays advocacy on policy matters before the legislature.” As evidence of the group’s affiliation with the PAC, Geren cited the organizations' shared address — but by the time Geren’s letter was issued, the lawsuit claims, they no longer shared that address. Empower Texans PAC has backed primary opponents to Geren and has given Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who leads the Texas Senate, more than $850,000 in the last five years. In the lawsuit, filed this week in federal court in Austin, the organization alleges that its history with Geren — who, the complaint says, “has routinely and openly expressed hostility” to the group “on account of their publications” — led him to engage in “bad faith viewpoint discrimination.” It asks a federal judge to force Geren to issue media credentials to the two employees. Reached on the floor of the Texas House on Wednesday morning, Geren said he had no comment on the lawsuit. Empower Texans, which operates under several names, is a unique blend of political action committee, advocacy group and news outlet. During the session, it produces a biweekly newspaper and a weekday morning newsletter, as well as a weekly podcast and video broadcast. But the organization also directly advocates for specific votes on specific measures — releasing regular “vote notices” that call on elected officials to back its priorities — and ranks lawmakers on an A-F scale as either “pro-” or “anti-taxpayer.” Although they do not have media credentials in the Texas House, Waltens and Sensky — like anyone else — can sit in the public second-floor gallery. Only journalists, lawmakers, staff and special guests are permitted on the chambers’ floors, where they enjoy easier access to elected officials. The lawsuit alleges that “by denying plaintiffs access to the hall of the House equal to that afforded to other media representatives, [Geren] is violating Plaintiffs’ rights to free speech and freedom of the press.” The complaint claims that “no employee of Empower Texans is required to register as a lobbyist and the organization does not employ or contract with any person who is required to register as a lobbyist.” The organization has presented itself as a journalism outlet before. In 2017, Geren pulled a press pass that had been issued for another employee of the group, Cary Cheshire  Waltens and Sensky are common fixtures at the press table in the Texas Senate, where their coverage sometimes reflects the conservative bent of their organization. They have also reported on goings-on in the Texas House.	false

8de5ccdd	248 Counties Have More Registered Voters Than Live Adults 24 States Show Corrupted Voter Rolls (INDIANAPOLIS, IN.) – September 25, 2017: The Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) today announced that it placed 248 counties on notice for holding more registered voters than adult residents in their respective jurisdictions. Officials in 24 states now risk lawsuits if they do not disclose satisfactory data demonstrating effective voter roll maintenance efforts before and after the 2016 Election. “During the 2016 Election, 24 states had bloated voter rolls,” PILF President and General Counsel J. Christian Adams said. “Voter fraud begins with corrupted voter rolls. Our nation’s voter rolls have records that cannot be distinguished between living or dead; citizen or alien; resident or relocated. We hear about possible cyber-attacks, but we aren’t doing enough to fix voter rolls that are certainly corrupt. The voter rolls are so bad in some states that election officials would have a hard time telling the difference between sabotage and negligence.” Letters mailed to the counties and locales in question note that it appears they are violating the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) because they are not properly maintaining the voter rolls. The NVRA (also known as Motor Voter) requires state and local election officials to properly maintain voter rolls and ensure that only eligible voters are registered. Holding more registrants than living adults indicates that election officials have failed to properly maintain voter rolls. The Public Interest Legal Foundation has a distinguished record of bringing litigation against counties and locales with bloated voter rolls—yielding settlements and consent decrees that, if followed properly, will put jurisdictions on a path to more realistic voter registration rates. PILF has been involved in bringing nine separate lawsuits in the last two years to enforce list maintenance provisions of the NVRA, including in Texas, Mississippi, Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and Pennsylvania. PILF recently completed the first trial in the history of the NVRA to enforce list maintenance obligations. The case was brought on behalf of the American Civil Rights Union against Broward County, Florida. States with counties that received a notice letter are (# of counties): Kentucky (41), Michigan (32), Iowa (31), Illinois (22), Mississippi (19), Colorado (17), Texas (12), Alabama (12), South Dakota (12), Nebraska (9), Georgia (6), New York (6), West Virginia (6), New Mexico (5), North Carolina (5), California (2), Louisiana (2), Montana (2), Virginia (2), Arizona (1), Florida (1), Missouri (1), Oklahoma (1), and Washington State (1). Kentucky’s surpassing Michigan as the most bloated state is particularly concerning giving the Secretary of State’s belligerent, public refusals to share voter data with the Presidential Commission on Election Integrity, despite the State’s offering of the same information here. “Federal law requires election officials to conduct a reasonable effort to maintain voter registration lists free of dead voters, ineligible voters, and voters who have moved away,” the notice letters state. “Based on our comparison of publicly available information published by the U.S. Census Bureau and the federal Election Assistance Commission, it appears that your jurisdiction is failing to comply with these federal law requirements.” The notices seek a variety of documents to clearly discern which jurisdictions are failing to perform basic voter list maintenance duties. Some records sought concern: noncitizen voters; numbers of dead, duplicate, relocated, and felon removals; evidence of use for databases which better identify relocated or alien registrants; and third-party communications about voter rolls, among others. If a local official fails to respond to PILF’s letter or declines to allow inspection of election records, they risk a federal lawsuit.

976a9cc4	The row over school closures during the pandemic has exploded into full blown conflict this weekend, with teachers putting Nicola Sturgeon in the firing line, and turning on a hardline parent group which wants kids back in class no matter what. Writer at Large Neil Mackay reports The teachers SCOTLAND’S teachers have had enough. Firstly, teachers say, they’ve had enough of Nicola Sturgeon putting her electoral fortunes ahead of education. Secondly, they’ve had enough of being bullied, harassed and attacked by what they see as a highly politicised mob on social media employing Trump-style tactics against them, and demanding schools stay open even in the most dangerous of circumstances. Larry Flanagan, head of Scotland’s largest teaching union the EIS, deals with the Scottish Government every day as the nation’s schools struggle to make it through lockdown. Ask him about Sturgeon’s handling of Covid and schools and he pointedly says: “I think the First Minister is very focused on the election.” Privately, senior Scottish teachers who work with the Government on the pandemic aren’t so diplomatic. “John Swinney [Deputy First Minister and Education Secretary] has his eye firmly fixed on the educational challenges,” one said. “The First Minister has her eye firmly fixed on the election. There’s a tension in Government there.” Flanagan feels that “Nicola Sturgeon and her Government are as focused on the politics of the situation as they are on the educational issues – whereas our focus is entirely educational”. The SNP administration “has an eye on the political optics as much as anything else”. Sturgeon is sensitive to criticism that she’s putting politics before education. Flanagan says he doesn’t understand why “as it’s in their DNA”. Flanagan also feels that “the general message of the Government has been less than empathetic to teachers”. The experience of teachers has been “harrowing, high stress … Most have been living on the edge and torn between the desire to do their best for students but also knowing they’re at risk on a daily basis … A lot feel undervalued, particularly by Government and the political class.” He adds: “It can be a demoralising experience. We’ve said directly to Government … that it’s shown a distant lack of empathy with the challenges that have existed in schools, as if there are no issues to be concerned about. They’ve underplayed teacher concerns.” On the First Minister, Flanagan says: “If you were to analyse most of her comments she rarely says very much about teachers, her focus is on parents and pupils, and that’s legitimate … for her to be concerned about, but I think a lot of teachers feel she’s just dismissive of their concerns.” Although schools are now closed, many teachers feel they had to battle to get this far against a government which wanted to put the wishes of parents before safety. Although teachers obviously worry for themselves and their families, many also felt that keeping schools open endangered pupils, pupils’ families and the wider community. Teachers haven’t forgotten the period before Christmas when they clamoured for school closures as the new Covid variant started to hit but the Government remained intransigent, insisting schools were safe and should remain open. Teachers were horrified that schools remained opened as level four restrictions were introduced. “That’s when the political debate became sharper,” Flanagan said, adding: “All we wanted was at level four, each council should look at the potential for blended or remote learning if it was required.” He references cases such as one Scottish school which “had over 400 pupils off with Covid-related illnesses and self-isolation ... and they still weren’t closing the school … We were saying there’s clearly a huge community outbreak in this area – closing the school makes sense, going to remote learning is a better educational position and it’ll drive down infection levels, but at that point it had become a kind of totem for the Government that they weren’t going to close schools”. Flanagan told Swinney that he thought the Education Secretary was “frightened to close schools in case you get a backlash”. Nor have teachers forgotten that the Government backtracked on plans for blended learning and suddenly switched, opting for a full reopening of schools last summer. “That was just a straight political decision as the FM was concerned at the backlash … the FM realised that having blended learning for a year was unlikely to do her party’s election chances any good so she wanted a different message.” Referencing the past debate around closing schools, Flanagan highlighted what he calls “the sophistry you get from the Scottish Government. They said ‘the risk to teenagers is no greater than to adults’. Well, that’s fine, but there’s quite a high risk to adults. You’re downplaying it by saying ‘it’s not greater than’ … John Swinney kept saying schools were safe environments. I kept saying they’re not … that’s why teachers were getting annoyed as they downplayed the risk.” Claims over the safety benefits of pupils social distancing incense teachers. “It’s not possible,” says Flanagan. No teacher spoken to said it was possible to keep a class of 30 pupils socially distanced. Teachers have also expressed concerns over Government use of data. Flanagan says that in November, data was used to claim schools were safe but statistics covered just the first six weeks of schools being reopened. “There was political sleight of hand to reference a retrospective report as being immediately applicable to the current situation,” he says. The EIS leader, who sits on the Government’s Covid Education Recovery Group, also raised concerns about the circumstances surrounding schools staying open at the end of last year. “At the time we were calling for a ‘firebreak’ while the Government and local authorities were saying ‘no’, but looking back at the data for the period it shows that school infections had reached their highest peak in all age groups since the pandemic started.” Flanagan added: “I think the Government and the First Minister have got a political objective around schools being open. They’d say that’s because, like us, they understand the importance of schools to young people’s wellbeing. We’re not going to disagree on that but I think they also have quite a political agenda. They’re potentially open to attack from other parties if they’re seen to be closing schools – and getting parental backlash.” In comparison to the UK Government, however, Flanagan is clear that “by and large the Scottish Government’s default position is to seek partnership and collaboration”. The EIS is fully involved in discussions about decision-making. In England, teacher groups “struggle just to get dialogue”. The Scottish Government, he stresses, “is not as unreasonable as the UK Government”. Flanagan is conscious of the fact that he has to keep Government onside. “I need to be able to persuade Government to do the right thing,” he says. Many members, however, are keen to strike if pushed too far. “Ultimately, we’re trying to get a reasonable response from Government … it would be failure of the partnership approach if we had to ballot for industrial action.” Sturgeon said this week that schools will remain shut until at least the middle of February. Teachers, though, fear a rush to reopen before its safe. Flanagan points to the new variant’s “transmissability among young people”. There are fears over reopening schools without properly enforced social distancing among pupils. “All that will happen is the R figure will go up,” Flanagan says. In terms of discussions around the future of reopening schools, he adds: “There’s a lot of unknowns and they’re all contingent on the control of the virus and the impact of the vaccine.” The vast majority of teachers want schools open but they want them reopened safely. “Teachers absolutely know that schools being open is the best thing possible for kids, it’s the easiest option for teachers when it comes to learning as remote learning is a huge challenge.” There is a worry among rank-and-file teachers that Government decisions are taken by civil servants and other experts who know little about life inside schools and so lack “empathy”. Flanagan says that when it comes to Covid, there have been “more fights with individual councils than we’ve had with Government”. There are sometimes different approaches taken to schools across different council areas. “Teachers who were shielding before we moved to lockdown, in a number of areas they were allowed to work from home,” Flanagan says. “In Glasgow, they said ‘no, you can’t, teachers are frontline, they have to be in school or off sick’. This was even for people with medical letters. Glasgow said ‘no’ – so Glasgow can be very hardline.” Teachers also worry that their safety comes secondary to the economy and allowing parents to work. “There’s an element around why schools need to open which isn’t about the needs of children, but the needs of the economy,” says Flanagan, though he adds: “I don’t think it’s writ as large in Scotland as it is in England … by and large Scotland has benefited from a more cautious approach to the virus.” Although teachers are sympathetic to parents, there is a limit to sympathy. “Some of the emails I’m getting … about having to support their child with home learning – I do have to temper my replies … They’re your children – the idea that the school should be there to provide childcare is an unwelcome thread.” Flanagan also feels that “the discourse around lost learning has to be challenged. What we have is interrupted learning, nothing is lost or irretrievable. There are kids every year who miss a whole year because they’re ill and you wouldn’t say about those kids ‘that’s it, you’ve missed your chance’. It’s nihilistic. To say your future is gone is just rubbish. Politicians fall into this trap far too easily.” Teachers are critical of Government failure to prepare for this new lockdown when it comes to remote learning and “digital inequality” – the lack of computers, and wi-fi, for poor children. The EIS says not enough equipment has been distributed. “In Glasgow, some iPads issued have protocols which don’t allow kids to access videos.” Flanagan urged the Government to follow a cautious approach to reopening schools. “The key issue now is, with potentially only a few months to go until the vaccine impacts, why would you run a high-risk strategy?” The parents Speak to most teachers, and they’ll tell you that they believe a new online group is twisting the national conversation around schools during Covid. Us For Them – which styles itself as a “grass-roots” parent lobby group – has too much influence in the thinking of the Scottish Government, teachers feel. UFT exists primarily on Facebook and sprang to life during lockdown. Flanagan calls them “the parents from nowhere” – although some figures such as Lord Jack McConnell, former Labour First Minister, has offered them support online. Certainly, UFT doesn’t take the constructive approach to parent-teacher relations of established groups like the National Parent Forum of Scotland. Teachers have accused UFT of undisclosed political connections. There have been claims of an anti-SNP agenda. Flanagan accused the organisation of having a “strong core of Covid deniers”. The EIS and UFT have been engaged in a war of words over claims that teachers were being recorded. Many teachers, Flanagan says, “feel they’re in state of siege”. He claims UFT is a “platform for self-promotion … some of them have political ambitions”. Flanagan says he doesn’t in any way “dismiss the concerns of parents around blended and remote learning” but UFT has “an anti-teacher agenda”. He worries that the organisation is “manipulating the concerns of parents”, and that “their language and attitude [is] intimidating”. Teachers are “concerned that Government pays too much attention” to the group, Flanagan says. He speculated that Sturgeon was not “immune” to the organisation “as she reacted to them very quickly last lockdown”. Jo Bisset is the face of UFT in Scotland. She won’t offer any solutions to help make schools safer. “Schools are safe,” Bisset claims, adding: “We don’t see ourselves as having to solve a problem as it’s not a problem we acknowledge.” “We don’t see there’s any need for social distancing in schools … it isn’t a dangerous environment,” she says. Bisset claims that “face masks in schools are really inappropriate”, and references children with autism, hearing impairment and “selective mutism”. She claims “there’s a huge amount of harm from this enforcement of masks” and “having a mask on children in schools doesn’t make any sense”. Nor does Bisset support teachers wearing masks. “If there are vulnerable teachers in schools and they feel they need to wear masks I think my first question would be ‘should that teacher really be in school if they’re so vulnerable’? … Perhaps, they should be furloughed.” Bisset insists that UFT isn’t anti-teacher. “We’re incredibly in favour of teachers,” she claims. Teachers, though, recount incidents of being abused on social media by people connected to UFT. Bisset says this could be people who’ve had “a bad day … and just spill their guts – people often don’t think that closely about what they’re writing on social media and quite frankly why should they?” On the group’s campaign against Government closure of schools, she says: “We’re not going to stop. There may or may not be an election coming up and we think that education is the issue of the election … if political parties aren’t listening to parents now, then they really need to, otherwise they’re going to lose votes.” Bisset says claims that “we’re funded by dark money and we’re all failed Tory candidates and we’ve some big political agenda is completely wrong”. She insists all funding is from the public through sites like GoFundMe. On political connections, she says: “Well, there’s this one guy, but he’s secret, he’s not actually an active politician now but he has been.” She later adds: “He was a Labour MP.” UFT praises MSPs like Alex Neil of the SNP, who has criticised blended learning as “absolutely unacceptable”, and Michelle Ballantyne, tje former Conservative now leading Nigel Farage’s Reform Party in Scotland. Ballantyne was accused a few days ago of “an anti-lockdown rant”. Bisset accused the EIS of “concerted smear attempts”. When asked if UFT could have handled debate better, she replied: “I don’t care. I’m not in politics … I’m not responsible for what nameless people write on the internet.” Teachers say that as UFT frontwoman she must take responsibility. Bisset claimed she’d “love” to work in a classroom unmasked, and doesn’t believe teachers need to socially distance from children. Asked whether this posed a wider infection risk, she claimed: “Coronavirus is principally transmitted adult to adult, so as long as adults are socially distancing then you’re massively reducing your risk – so you can socially distance adults … in schools far more easily than you can do in many other sectors. So for me, if I was a teacher in a school, my key goal would be to socially distance from adults.” Several teachers were asked to comment on this. All dismissed it as “dangerous” or “nonsense”. Bisset, who is from Edinburgh and works in the oil and gas sector, has two teenage children in a private school. When asked if it was unfair of her to comment on state education, she replied: “I don’t know why I’d have to have my children in state school in order to be able to point out a fact that children in the state sector will be getting worse … education typically.” She said “private schools will be delivering a much more comprehensive level of education”. The Government's response Responding to EIS comments, a government spokeswoman said: “Our top priority is the health and safety of pupils, staff and teachers. The current lockdown demonstrates that commitment to keeping people safe. While decisions to move to remote learning are hard, they have been taken in a timely manner in light of the developing public heath position. While we acknowledge the long-standing campaign by Mr Flanagan to have schools closed, we believe that shift came at the right time. “Overall, we believe that the support in place for pupils learning remotely has been well-received. This includes, by the end of December, almost 59,000 devices such as laptops and over 10,000 connectivity packages distributed to learners. In total, the programme, supported by a £25 million investment, is expected to deliver over 70,000 devices for disadvantaged children and young people. A new package of £45 million, announced last week, means councils can supply additional devices or family support to those who need it most. That is substantial and is making a significant difference to the learning that pupils are receiving.”	Majority of Britons think police have lost control of the streets	partially false
65d9521c	The federal government has asked school administrators to start preparing for the full reopening of schools. Advertisement Sani Aliyu, national coordinator of the presidential task force (PTF) on COVID-19, gave the directive at the PTF briefing on Thursday. Aliyu, who directed them to conduct risk assessment, said the reopening would be done in phases. “For educational institutions which include daycare, primary, secondary and tertiary institutions. Educational institutions should begin the process of working towards potentially reopening within this phase,” he said. Advertisement “However, we strongly recommend that states conduct risk assessment to ensure all schools are at a level of compliance and create a monitoring mechanism to assess, create, and monitor this level of preparedness. Meanwhile, daycare centres should remain closed until this level of risk is assessed. If there will be opening of schools, it must be stage and preferably carried out in phases to ensure that this does not pose a risk to the public and in particular to vulnerable groups that might end up getting infected by students going back home.” The federal government had ordered a nationwide closure of schools in March to check the spread of COVID-19.

Omega-3 fats can help lower a person’s risk for Alzheimer’s. But, you have to be careful. One inexpensive way to get the right amount of seafood is to buy Tilapia – it isn’t going to break the bank. But there are new warnings about eating Tilapia. tilapia Image Credit: N/A Wake Forest University School of Medicine researchers studied Tilapia and have some shocking information. Tilapia, when compared to other kinds of fish has very little Omega-3. They are chock full of Omega-6 fatty acids – which increase your risk for Alzheimer’s! tilapia The amount of Omega-6 fatty acids that Tilapia contain is even higher than bacon and hamburger. Arachidonic acid, one of the omega-6 fatty acids, is linked with an increase of inflammatory damage seen before the onset of Alzheimer’s. tilapia The Tilapia we buy is farmed. The fish will eat just about anything, so farmers have no trouble raising the hearty fish. Reportedly, some farmers actually feed their Tilapia pig and chicken poop! tilapia Image Credit: N/A To make matters worse, they are bombarded with antibiotics – and they are genetically altered. The chemicals that the Tilapia come in contact with makes them a suspect in causing cancer. Tilapia have been found with a toxic chemical in them called dioxin. tilapia The human body can’t get rid of the dioxin (it is linked with the development and progression of cancer). All of this helps them grow faster so the farmers can make more money. Stay away from Tilapia. Eat halibut, mackerel, or sardines instead!	false
650bd80f	When charges of “racism” and “xenophobia” fail, Democrats’ fallback argument against President Trump’s proposed border wall is that it simply “won’t work,” so why waste billions building it? Tell that to the residents of El Paso, Texas. Federal data show a far-less imposing wall than the one Trump envisions — a two-story corrugated metal fence first erected under the Bush administration — already has dramatically curtailed both illegal border crossings and crime in Texas’ sixth-largest city, which borders the high-crime Mexican city of Juarez. In fact, the number of deportable illegal immigrants located by the US Border Patrol plummeted by more than 89 percent over the five-year period during which the controversial new fence was built, according to Homeland Security data I reviewed. When the project first started in 2006, illegal crossings totaled 122,261, but by 2010, when the 131-mile fence was completed from one end of El Paso out into the New Mexico desert, immigrant crossings shrank to just 12,251. They hit a low of 9,678 in 2012, before slowly ticking back up to a total of 25,193 last year. But they’re still well below pre-fence levels, and the Border Patrol credits the fortified barrier dividing El Paso from Mexico for the reduction in illegal flows. And crime abated with the reduced human traffic from Juarez, considered one of the most dangerous places in the world due to drug-cartel violence, helping El Paso become one of the safest large cities in America. Before 2010, federal data show the border city was mired in violent crime and drug smuggling, thanks in large part to illicit activities spilling over from the Mexican side. Once the fence went up, however, things changed almost overnight. El Paso since then has consistently topped rankings for cities of 500,000 residents or more with low crime rates, based on FBI-collected statistics. The turnaround even caught the attention of former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and other Obama administration officials, who touted it as one of the nation’s safest cities while citing the beefed-up border security there. Federal data illustrates just how remarkable the turnaround in crime has been since the fence was built. According to FBI tables, property crimes in El Paso have plunged more than 37 percent to 12,357 from their pre-fence peak of 19,702 a year, while violent crimes have dropped more than 6 percent to 2,682 from a peak of 2,861 a year. The overall crime rate in El Paso continued to fall last year, prompting city leaders to trumpet the good news in a press release that noted, “Because El Paso is a border town, its low crime rate may surprise you.” Since the fence was completed, the volume of marijuana and cocaine coming through El Paso and seized by Border Patrol agents has been cut in half El Paso City Manager Tommy Gonzalez boasted that the city will “continue to lead our country in public safety.” Another core promise made by Trump to justify constructing a massive wall spanning from Texas to California is that it will slow the flow of drugs coming across the border from Mexico. “We need the wall for security. We need the wall for safety,” Trump said last week while answering questions about the sweeping new GOP immigration bill. “We need the wall for stopping the drugs from pouring in.” On that score, El Paso already has exceeded expectations. Drug smuggling along that border entry point has also fallen dramatically. In fact, since the fence was completed, the volume of marijuana and cocaine coming through El Paso and seized by Border Patrol agents has been cut in half. The year before the wall was fully built in 2010, the volume of illegal drugs confiscated by the feds along the El Paso border hit 87,725 pounds. The year after, the amount of drug seizures plummeted to 43,783 pounds. Last year, they dropped even further to a total of 34,329, according to Border Patrol reports obtained by The Post. All told, a legion of empirical evidence supports the idea a southern border wall could, in fact, work. There is also anecdotal evidence. In local press accounts, El Paso residents and business owners alike have praised the fence, citing it as an effective deterrent to both illegal crossings and crime. see also Border Patrol busts drop to 46-year low Arrests by Border Patrol agents dropped to a 46-year low... Now Trump plans to build a possibly bigger deterrent. The existing fence along the El Paso sector, which is made of a combination of corrugated steel and metal meshing, towers 21-feet high at some points and is already hard to climb. But the Trump wall, which will begin construction in El Paso, will be even taller and have multiple layers of security. Still, Democratic leaders are adamantly opposed to it. They argue the $18 billion wall won’t work to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and will only be a massive waste of tax dollars. “We think, frankly, the building of the wall, its cost is not justified either by its efficiency or effectiveness,” House Minority Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said Thursday. Even local Democrats are arguing with success. “That wall in itself is a racist reaction to a racist myth that does not reflect the reality of this country at all,” said Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-El Paso). Paul Sperry is a former Hoover Institution media fellow and author of several books, including the bestseller “Infiltration.”	Roads to the Capitol: Six new members of Congress on their personal journeys	partially false
42b5592a	Proctor, VT — According to NBC News, a pastor at the Christian Proctor Church in Vermont, has been sentenced to one year in federal prison after refusing to marry gay couples. This comes shortly after the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decisionruling that states must allow gay marriage. The Christian Pastor, 56-year-old Paul Horner, had his lawyer speak to reporters on his behalf. “We are currently disputing the guilty verdict and I am confident my client will be a free man here shortly,” said attorney Tom Downey. “Horner was just using his best judgement according to his rights and religious freedom in this country.” The Honorable Myron Danus handed down the harsh sentence. “Religious freedom goes both ways, Mr. Horner,” Danus told a packed courtroom. “It is not your place to deny individuals the same rights that everyone else has, rights that were passed down and agreed upon in a court of law, the ultimate court, the Supreme Court. It is not your decision whether or not you agree with the law but more importantly that you follow it and enforce it.” According to the criminal investigation, the Christian Proctor Church is registered with the state as a “religious corporation” limited to performing “one-man-one-woman marriages as defined by the Holy Bible.” But the church is also registered as a for-profit business and city officials said that means the owners must comply with state and federal regulations. Steve Shand president of the Vermont Family Research Committee, said it is “open season on Americans who refuse to bow to the government’s redefinition of marriage.” “Homosexuals are gay,” Shand told reporters. “Why should Christian ministers be forced to perform and celebrate any marriage that conflicts with their beliefs? It’s a slippery slope my friend. Pretty soon these same pastors will be forced to wed animals or kitchen appliances. This is not my America!” Gwen Hawkins who is president of the LGBT Pride Center in Vermont said she is happy with the guilty verdict. “We just want the same rights as everyone else and this guilty verdict sets a great precedent,” Hawkins said. “These fanatical Christians base their life on one verse in the Bible but they seem to forget the other 99% of the verses in the book. For example, why can’t we stone to death Bristol Palin for having a baby out of wedlock? And what about her mother, Sarah Palin, breaking the rules of Corinthians 14:34 which clearly state that as a woman, she is not allowed to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. But no, they like to pick the one verse in the Bible about gay people and build their camp around it.” Proctor is a town in Rutland County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,741 at the 2010 census. Proctor is home to the Vermont Marble Museum, Wilson Castle and the only marble bridge in America.	Why are climate-change models so flawed?

866a5b6b	Beaumont, Texas | An employee of the Jefferson County morgue died this morning after being accidentally cremated by one of his coworkers. According to the Beaumont Police Department, 48-year old Henri Paul Johnson decided to take a nap on a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight. While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year-old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory. Before anyone could notice the mistake, he had already been exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and reduced to ashes. Jenna Davis, one of Henri Johnson’s coworkers, says she heard him scream for about 15 seconds after the crematory was activated. “At first, we didn’t understand where the sound was coming from. When we realised what was happening, it was too late. We shut down the heating system, but he was already dead.” Ms. Davis claims that the young coworker who caused the accident was a new employee and had forgotten to check for the toe tag to make sure he had the right body. The police have opened an investigation to determine the exact circumstances surrounding Mr. Johnson’s death. Investigators have not ruled out the possibility of filing criminal charges against the employee who caused his death. The young man could possibly be accused of criminal negligence causing death.

83c0b379	A Nasa scientist has said a current slowdown in sunspot activity could cause temperatures in the upper layer of our atmosphere to plummet. Other researchers have previously warned that the lack of sunspots could herald the arrival of a uniquely grim ‘mini Ice Age’. But the Nasa scientist went on to say that the trend he sees is overall global warming, not cooling, and insisted this ‘solar minimum’ does not mean the world is going to shiver through a depressingly long winter. ‘We see a cooling trend,’ Martin Mlynczak of Nasa’s Langley Research Center told Space Weather. ‘High above Earth’s surface, near the edge of space, our atmosphere is losing heat energy. ‘If current trends continue, it could soon set a Space Age record for cold.’ Advertisement Advertisement ‘It could happen in a matter of months,’ Mlynczak added. Sunspot activity follows a cycle which is believed to last 11 years as the number of patches peaks and drops. There have been very few spots on the sun for most of this year. An image taken earlier this year showing the surface of our star without sunspots (Picture: Nasa) MORE : Hackers will ‘take down the internet in 2019’ Earlier this year, Nasa released a picture showing the blank face of the sun looking more like a snooker ball than the roiling surface of a super-hot star. The sun is predicted to reach its solar minimum in 2019 or 2020, according to Nasa’s calculations. Perhaps the most famous period of low sunspot activity was the Maunder Minimum of the 17th century. During that time, there was a ‘little ice age’ when the Thames froze over, although researchers believe that global warming will stop this happening again. Solar minimum may enhance the effects of space weather, disrupt communications and navigation, and even cause space junk to ‘hang around’, Nasa said. MORE : An asteroid will ‘inevitably’ hit Earth and have a ‘calamitous’ effect on humanity, scientist warns Last year, a scientist claimed the chilling effect on the lack of sunspots could actually save us from global warming – although her claims were hotly disputed. Valentina Zharkova, a professor of mathematics at Northumbria University, published a paper which contains ‘the first serious prediction of a reduction of solar activity that might affect human lives’. ‘I hope global warming will be overridden by this effect, giving humankind and the Earth 30 years to sort out our pollution,’ she said. Advertisement Advertisement Michael Brown, an associate professor of astronomy at Monash University in Australia, said the Maunder Minimum could have been caused by other factors including the eruptions of volcanos. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video He does not believe a mini Ice Age is enough to save us from manmade climate change. ‘There is 40% more of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in the air now than during the 17th century, and global temperature records are being smashed,’ he said. ‘A new Maunder Minimum would slow climate change, but it is not enough to stop it.’ After this article was published, Martin Mlynczak issued the following statement to Climate Feedback: ‘The cooling effects we are seeing in Earth’s thermosphere are a result of the current solar minimum conditions. ‘The thermosphere is the layer of Earth’s atmosphere beginning 65 miles above Earth’s surface and is highly sensitive to solar activity. ‘There is no relationship between the natural cycle of cooling and warming in the thermosphere and the weather/climate at Earth’s surface. NASA and other climate researchers continue to see a warming trend in the troposphere, the layer of atmosphere closest to Earth’s surface. ‘There is no inconsistency between the science findings of a warming troposphere [where we live] and the Thermosphere Climate Index.’ Update: This article has been amended since initial publication to remove the erroneous suggestion that the possibly record-breaking cooling of the thermosphere, located over 100km above the surface of the Earth, would have the effect on the troposphere of ‘a mini Ice Age’. We are happy to clarify that the record low temperatures reported as part of a natural cycle in solar activity are not inconsistent with current scientific findings of a warming troposphere, and apologise for any contrary impression given.

9e8e9ddd	ROME (Reuters) - It’s hard being a Catholic in Italy these days. St. Mark's Square is virtually deserted after a decree orders for the whole of Italy to be on lockdown in an unprecedented clampdown aimed at beating the coronavirus, in Venice, Italy, March 10, 2020. REUTERS/Manuel Silvestri You can walk into a church but you can’t cross yourself with holy water because the font is dry. You can’t get baptized or married in a church and you can’t even have a funeral. Just about the only thing a person can do in a church in Italy is pray - but at least a pew away from someone else. Overwhelmingly Catholic Italy is adapting to religion in a time of coronavirus after a clampdown across the entire country was imposed to slow Europe’s worst outbreak. Last Saturday, the Italian government issued a decree locking down much of the north, where the virus first broke out, and severely restricted indoor activities in the rest of the country. So on Sunday, Father Riccardo Lamba of the parish of San Ponziano, in a modern Rome neighborhood, took matters into his own hands. He moved the Mass outdoors and said it from the steps of his modern church. About 70 parishioners sat on plastic chairs with space between them and those who stood did so in formation as if they were about to take a gym class. Slideshow ( 2 images ) The government later took measures restricting outdoor gatherings. Lamba said he has not decided what he will do this Sunday. “We are praying. Many people are entering the church to pray during the day but trying to keep apart,” he said on Tuesday. His parish is not alone. Even St. Peter’s Basilica was eerily almost empty on Tuesday after the Vatican said only faithful who wanted to pray would be allowed in. Tourists and guided groups would not be allowed until at least April 3. “We are living day to day to see what happens. Sometimes the government changes its mind in a matter of hours,” Lamba said. “Thank God the hard-core faithful can watch a Mass on TV.” Church weddings have been blocked until at least April 3. The trickle down effect has hit the wedding planner industry on the cusp of spring, its high season. “We have closed the office for now and have to wait and see how things develop,” said Sabrina Bucci, head of Esclusivevent, which organizes weddings in Rome’s churches and receptions in an ancient villa with a view of the dome of St. Peter’s Basilica. She said five weddings had been postponed indefinitely. The coronavirus crisis has also changed the way Catholics say farewell to their dearly departed. Since funerals in churches have been banned, bodies are being taken directly to cemeteries either from hospitals or homes, denying families a traditional rite of passage that brings people together. “This morning’s funeral could not be held. A priest came to the home to bless the body and we took it directly to the cemetery,” said Stefano Chiericoni, head of one of Rome’s best-known undertakers. “We are doing what the health authorities are telling us to do and, in any case, we are wearing masks and protective gowns,” he said.

bc815fa3	President Vladimir Putin held his annual end-of-year press conference on Thursday, answering questions from state media and independent journalists on an array of topics related to Russia's domestic and foreign policy. Here are the highlights from the marathon presser that lasted four hours and 19 minutes: On constitutional term limits for the presidency: — One thing that could be changed about these [presidential] terms is removing the clause about 'successive' [terms]. Your humble servant served two terms consecutively, then left his post, but with the constitutional right to return to the post of president again, because these two terms were not successive. [This clause] troubles some of our political analysts and public figures. Well, maybe it could be removed. On climate change: — “But we're not really sure why global warming is happening, but we need to do something about it.” — “We have the greenest energy system in the world. New industries have been created: liquefied natural gas, hydropower. Those who believe that we live on old resources are deeply mistaken.” On U.S. President Donald Trump’s impeachment: — You phrase your question as if Trump's presidency is coming to an end. I am not sure that's the case. [The impeachment bill] still needs to go through the Senate where Republicans as far as I know have a majority. It's unlikely they will want to remove from power a representative of their party based on what are, in my opinion, completely fabricated reasons. On Russia’s spat with Germany over the killing of an ex-Chechen rebel in Berlin: — “The issue of extraditing Khangoshvili was discussed at the level of our special services but there was no official request, because we knew that it would be refused.” — “This is an absolute bloody killer. He killed 98 people in the Caucasus — think about it. He participated in the attacks in the Moscow metro.” On the election of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson: — Johnson can be congratulated. He was victorious after all and had a better sense of the British public's mood than his political opponents. And as far as I understand, he intends to implement all of his Brexit plans. — In regards to [Russian] interference or non-interference, we've heard many times from official governing bodies in various countries, including Britain, assessments of what is happening inside Russia. Is that interference? On China: — We do not have a military alliance with China and we do not plan to create one. — But our relations with China continue to develop, including in the sphere of defence technologies... I think China is capable of producing its own ballistic missile early warning system, but with our help it can do so sooner. This will improve our strategic partner's ability to defend itself in a significant way. On the Libyan conflict: — Russia is in touch with [Libyan Prime Minister Fayez] al-Serraj and with [eastern Libyan commander Khalifa] Haftar. We are also constantly maintaining dialogue with our partners, including Turkey, Europe and other countries. — In our opinion, the best outcome would be for an agreement to be reached between the two conflicting sides that would lead to an end to military actions, and would establish who will rule the country, how, and what responsibilities they would have. On extending the New START arms control treaty with the U.S.: — We are ready until the end of the year to extend the existing agreement, the new START treaty. — But thus far there has been no answer to any of our suggestions. And without a new START treaty, there is nothing to curb an arms race. And that, in my opinion, is bad. On Russia’s doping scandal: — If WADA does not have any claims against our national Olympic Committee, then our team should be allowed to participate under its own flag. On Ukraine peace talks: — If a revision of the Minsk [peace] Agreements starts, then the situation could enter a complete dead end. — Direct dialogue on Donbass is needed. It is lacking. On internet freedom and the “foreign agents” law: — “Free internet and sovereign internet do not contradict each other. The [‘sovereign internet’] law is aimed only at preventing negative influence in case foreign resources are restricted.” — “We are not moving toward closing off the internet and are not going to do that.” — “It wasn’t us who coined the term ‘foreign agent.’ A similar law has been in force in the U.S. since the 1930s.”	Florida GOP candidates for governor weigh in on school board term limits	partially false
72eb0d0c	"In response to Gen David Petraeus' denunciation of Florida pastor Terry Jones' right to engage in a symbolic protest of the 9/11 attacks by burning copies of the Quran this Sept. 11, President Obama said: ""Let me be clear: As a citizen, and as president, I believe that members of the Dove World Outreach Center have the same right to freedom of speech and religion as anyone else in this country."" Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida lauded Obama's remarks, saying America is ""a place where you're supposed to be able to practice your religion without the government telling you you can't."" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg called Obama's words a ""clarion defense of the freedom of religion"" -- and also claimed that he had recently run into a filthy jihadist who actually supported the Quran-burning! Keith Olbermann read the poem ""First they came ..."" on air in defense of the Quran-burners, nearly bringing himself to tears at his own profundity. No wait, my mistake. This is what liberals said about the ground zero mosque only five minutes ago when they were posing as First Amendment absolutists. Suddenly, they've developed amnesia when it comes to the free-speech right to burn a Quran. Weirdly, conservatives who opposed building the mosque at ground zero are also against the Quran burning. (Except in my case. It turns out I'm for it, but mostly because burning Qurans will contribute to global warming.) Liberals couldn't care less about the First Amendment. To the contrary, censoring speech and religion is the left's specialty! (Any religion other than Islam.) They promote speech codes, hate crimes, free speech zones (known as ""America"" off college campuses), and go around the country yanking every reference to God from the public square via endless lawsuits by the ACLU. Whenever you see a liberal choking up over our precious constitutional rights, you can be sure we're talking about the rights of Muslims at ground zero, ""God Hates Fags"" funeral protesters, strippers, The New York Times publishing classified documents, pornographers, child molesters, murderers, traitors, saboteurs, terrorists, flag-burners (but not Quran-burners!) or women living on National Endowment of the Arts grants by stuffing yams into their orifices on stage. Speaking of lying dwarfs, last week on ""The Daily Show"" Bloomberg claimed he was having a hamburger with his ""girlfriend"" when a man came up to him and said of the ground zero mosque: ""I just got back from two tours fighting overseas for America. This is what we were all fighting for. You go and keep at it."" We're fighting for the right of Muslims to build mosques at ground zero? I thought we were trying to keep Muslims AWAY from our skyscrapers. (What an embarrassing misunderstanding.) PLEASE PULL THE TROOPS OUT IMMEDIATELY. But back to the main issue: Was Bloomberg having a $150 Burger Double Truffle at DB Bistro Moderne or a more sensible $30 burger at the 21 Club when he bumped into his imaginary veteran? With the pint-sized mayor shrieking at the sight of a saltshaker, I assume he wasn't having a Hardee's No. 4 Combo Meal. Adding an element of realism to his little vignette, Bloomberg said: ""I got a hamburger and a pickle and a potato chip or something."" A potato chip? Translation: ""I don't know what I was eating, because I'm making this whole story up -- I wouldn't be caught dead eating 'a potato chip' or any other picaresque garnish favored by the peasants."" At least Bloomberg didn't claim the man who walked up to him took credit for setting the Times Square bomb because he was a tea partier upset about ObamaCare -- as Sherlock Bloomberg had so presciently speculated at the time. Gen. Petraeus objected to the Quran-burning protest on the grounds that it could be used by radical jihadists to recruit Muslims to attack Americans. This is what liberals say whenever we do anything displeasing to the enemy -- invade Iraq, hold captured terrorists in Guantanamo, interrogate captured jihadists or publish Muhammad cartoons. Is there a website somewhere listing everything that encourages terrorist recruiting? If the general's main objective is to hamper jihadist recruiting, may I respectfully suggest unconditional surrender? Because on his theory, you know what would really kill the terrorists' recruiting ability? If we adopted Sharia law! But wait -- weren't we assured by Fire Island's head of national security, Andrew Sullivan, that if America elected a ""brown-skinned man whose father was an African, who grew up in Indonesia and Hawaii, who attended a majority-Muslim school as a boy,"" the terrorists would look like a bunch of lunkheads and be unable to recruit? It didn't work out that way. There have been more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil by these allegedly calmed Muslims in Obama's first 18 months in office than in the six years under Bush after he invaded Iraq. Also, as I recall, there was no Guantanamo, no Afghanistan war and no Iraq war on Sept. 10, 2001. And yet, somehow, Osama bin Ladin had no trouble recruiting back then. Can we retire the ""it will help them recruit"" argument yet? The reason not to burn Qurans is that it's unkind -- not to jihadists, but to Muslims who mean us no harm. The same goes for building a mosque at ground zero -- in both cases, it's not a question of anyone's ""rights,"" it's just a nasty thing to do."

168e5898	Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide has helped raise global food production and reduce poverty. National polls show that climate change is low on the list of voters’ priorities. For good reason: In the U.S., and for much of the world, the most dangerous environmental pollutants have been cleaned up. U.S. emissions of particulates, metals and varied gases—all of these: ozone, lead, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and sulfur—fell almost 70% between 1970 and 2014. Further reductions will come from improved technologies such as catalytic removal of oxides of nitrogen and more-efficient sulfur scrubbers. This is a boon to human health. But a myth persists that is both unscientific and immoral to perpetuate: that the beneficial gas carbon dioxide ranks among hazardous pollutants. It does not. Unlike genuine pollutants, carbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless, colorless gas. Every human being exhales about two pounds of CO2 a day, along with a similar amount of water vapor. CO2 is nontoxic to people and animals and is a vital nutrient to plants. It is also a greenhouse gas which helps maintain earth at a habitable temperature. Fear of excessive warming from more CO2 in the atmosphere, including that released from human activity, has caused some people to advocate substantial and expensive reductions in CO2 emissions. But observations, such as those on our CO2 Coalition website, show that increased CO2 levels over the next century will cause modest and beneficial warming—perhaps as much as one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit)—and that this will be an even larger benefit to agriculture than it is now. The costs of emissions regulations, which will be paid by everyone, will be punishingly high and will provide no benefits to most people anywhere in the world.

The official added the words ""who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge"". He later said the poem had referred to ""people coming from Europe"". Ken Cuccinelli, the Trump administration's acting head of Citizenship and Immigration Services, announced on Monday a new ""public charge"" requirement that limits legal migrants from seeking certain public benefits such as public housing or food aid, or are considered likely to do so in the future. image copyright Getty Images image caption The New Colossus was written by New York-born poet Emma Lazarus in 1883 The new regulation, known as a ""public charge rule"", was published in the Federal Register on Monday and will take effect on 15 October. The rule change is intended to reinforce ""ideals of self-sufficiency"", officials said. Critics argue that it will prevent low-income US residents from seeking help. What did the official say? On Tuesday, Mr Cuccinelli was asked by NPR whether the 1883 poem titled The New Colossus at the Statue of Liberty still applied. ""Would you also agree that Emma Lazarus's words etched on the Statue of Liberty, 'Give me your tired, give me your poor,' are also a part of the American ethos?"" asked NPR's Rachel Martin. image copyright Getty Images image caption Ken Cuccinelli, the acting head of US Citizenship and Immigration Services ""They certainly are,"" Mr Cuccinelli responded. ""Give me your tired and your poor - who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge."" ""That plaque was put on the Statue of Liberty at almost the same time as the first public charge [law] was passed - very interesting timing,"" he added. The actual passage reads in part: ""Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"" In the interview, he added that immigrants are welcome ""who can stand on their own two feet, be self-sufficient, pull themselves up by their bootstraps, again, as in the American tradition"". After the host asked if the policy ""appears to change the definition of the American dream,"" he said: ""We invite people to come here and join us as a privilege. ""No one has a right to become an American who isn't born here as an American."" media caption Top immigration official says public charge rule will not target ""any particular group"" Mr Cuccinelli was pressed later on CNN about his comments, and pushed back on claims he was trying to re-write the poem. He insisted he was answering a question and accused people on the left of ""twisting"" his comments. Then asked by anchor Erin Burnett about what America stands for, he said: ""Of course that poem was referring back to people coming from Europe - where they had class-based societies where people were considering wretched if they weren't in the right class."" The two then discussed their own immigrant ancestry, with Ms Burnett pointing out his rule would have ""excluded"" her family. ""I'm here because they were allowed in, and I'm an anchor on CNN,"" she said. Beto O'Rouke, a Democratic presidential hopeful from Texas, shared a clip from the interview and said the comments show his Trump administration ""think the Statue of Liberty only applies to white people"". This administration finally admitted what we’ve known all along: They think the Statue of Liberty only applies to white people. https://t.co/kTLl50yCmw — Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) August 14, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter Who will be affected by the new rule? Immigrants who are already permanent residents in the US are unlikely to be affected by the rule change. It also does not apply to refugees and asylum applicants. But applicants for visa extensions, green cards or US citizenship will be subject to the change. Those who do not meet income standards or who are deemed likely to rely on benefits such as Medicaid (government-run healthcare) or housing vouchers in future may be blocked from entering the country. Those already in the US could also have their applications rejected. An estimated 22 million legal residents in the US are without citizenship, and many of these are likely to be affected. President Trump has made immigration a central theme of his administration. This latest move is part of his government's efforts to curb legal immigration. What has reaction been? The Democratic led House Homeland Security Committee condemned Mr Cuccinelli's revision in a tweet, calling the words ""vile and un-American"". ""It's clear the Trump Administration just wants to keep certain people out,"" the committee wrote, calling Mr Cuccinelli ""a xenophobic, anti-immigrant fringe figure who has no business being in government"". Others pointed to his background as the attorney general of Virginia, in which he led a conservative campaign against immigration and homosexuality. Asked about Mr Cuccinelli's remarks on Tuesday, President Trump did not directly respond to the Statue of Liberty quote, but said: ""I don't think it's fair to have the American taxpayer pay for people to come into the United States."" ""I'm tired of seeing our taxpayer paying for people to come into the country and immediately go onto welfare and various other things."

8469a163	The Biden administration will soon deliver a sweeping response to the SolarWinds breach, so the usual suspect, Russia, understands where Washington draws the line on cyberattacks, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said. During his appearance on CBS' Face The Nation program on Sunday, Sullivan was asked about what US President Joe Biden's team was going to do about the SolarWinds hack, given that sanctions have proven to be ineffective against Moscow. The adviser replied by saying that the American “response will include a mix of tools seen and unseen.” He didn’t specify what those ‘tools’ might be. And it will not simply be sanctions because, as you say, a response to a set of activities like this require a more comprehensive set of tools, and that is what the administration intends to do. Also on rt.com Again with the ‘likely’: US spies accuse Russia of SolarWinds hack in repeat of Russiagate hysteria “It will be weeks, not months” before the US prepares retaliatory measures against Russia, Sullivan stated. We will ensure that Russia understands where the US draws the line on this kind of activity. The SolarWinds breach was reported in December, becoming one of the largest and most sophisticated cyberattacks to date. The hackers were able to insert software backdoors into a widely used network-management program, distributed by the Texas-based SolarWinds company. This allowed them to compromise the systems of more than 100 commercial firms globally, as well as nine US government agencies, with the breach only discovered eight or nine months later. READ MORE: ‘Largest-ever the world has seen’: Microsoft president claims 1,000+ software engineers must have worked on SolarWinds breech Washington insists that such an operation could not possibly have been carried out without foreign government support, while US intelligence and security agencies declared that the hack was ‘likely Russian in origin.’ This echoed evidence-free mainstream media claims as well as their own language in ‘assessments’ about the 2016 election. Moscow has denied any involvement in the SolarWinds breach, calling it “yet another unsubstantiated attempt” by the US to scapegoat Russia.

38a5453c	Dan O’Donnell dives into new data from the Wisconsin Elections Commission that shows a stunning anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots this November. February 3, 2021 Perspective by Dan O’Donnell Calling into question any aspect of November’s presidential election is a dangerous proposition these days. One is liable to be banned from social media or blamed for a riot at the U.S. Capitol even for suggesting that there might be irregularities that warrant further investigation. It is, however, far from conspiracy-mongering to accept the reality that those in charge of administering state elections here in Wisconsin put their thumb on the scales at every conceivable opportunity. The Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) violated state law by refusing to remove 234,000 names from the voter rolls and by keeping both Kanye West and the Green Party off the ballot so that they could not serve as spoilers for eventual winner Joe Biden. Milwaukee and Dane County clerks violated state law by telling voters that they could claim indefinite confinement (and thus avoid voter ID requirements) even if they themselves were not actually confined to their homes. The City of Madison violated state law by holding a ballot harvesting event (for which the Biden campaign actually advertised) in every one of its city parks. Now it seems likely that elections officials across the state refused to reject ballots that they normally would have (and probably legally should have). The WEC’s newly released Election Data Report reveals a staggering anomaly that is nearly impossible to otherwise explain: Despite a massive increase in the use of mail-in voting this November, the percentage of ballots that were rejected dropped to nearly zero. Just 4,270 absentee ballots out of 1,969,274 cast were rejected—a rate of 0.2%. This defies both logic and common sense. In November’s presidential election, there were roughly twice as many absentee ballots cast as in the spring 2016 election, yet in that election four years ago the rejection rate was 2.5%. If far more people were casting absentee ballots (and presumably casting them for the first time), it would stand to reason that the number of mistakes which cause ballots to be rejected would increase as well. Instead, those mistakes all but vanished. An infinitesimal 0.07% of ballots (1,434 in total) were rejected because of insufficient ballot certification. An even smaller 0.05% (1,045 total) were rejected because they were received after polls closed. And a microscopic 0.002% (just 42 total) were rejected because the ballot envelope was somehow compromised. This is nearly impossible to explain, especially since the ballot rejection rate was 1.8% just seven months earlier in Wisconsin’s spring election, when a then-record 1,101,474 absentee ballots were cast. Despite a 78% increase in the number of absentee ballots cast in November, there was a 78% decrease in the number of ballots that were rejected. Did hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites suddenly figure out how to correctly fill out their ballots? Or was there a concerted effort to count as many ballots as possible without regard to whether they were correctly filled out? The evidence points toward the latter. The ballot rejection rate in the April 2016 presidential primary was 2.5% with a 1.4% rejection rate the following November even though there were far fewer absentee ballots returned than in the 2020 presidential election cycle. The April 2020 rejection rate was well within the normal range at 1.8%, but then it suddenly dipped to a minuscule 0.2%. Interestingly enough, in the November 2018 gubernatorial election—which was also dogged by allegations of fraud following a sudden influx of absentee votes in Milwaukee that propelled Governor Tony Evers past Scott Walker—the absentee ballot rejection rate suddenly dropped to 0.2%. What exactly would be the odds that ballots suddenly stopped getting rejected in the two statewide races in which unpopular Republicans (Walker and Donald Trump) were on the ballot and both lost because of huge increases in absentee voting? Given that the Wisconsin Elections Commission has since 2016 been unlawfully telling local clerks to fix problematic ballots instead of returning them to voters as state statutes require, it seems as though it has been WEC policy (unlawful though it may be) to get as many questionable ballots counted as possible. This, however, doesn’t explain the sudden and dramatic dips in ballot rejection rates only in the 2018 gubernatorial and 2020 presidential elections. Either voters somehow figured out ballot return rules exceptionally well only in those two races or clerks and poll workers had a concerted effort to reject as few ballots as possible in an unlawful attempt at aiding Democrat challengers in their bid to unseat Republican incumbents whom the clerks and poll workers despised. Either way, this stunningly low rejection rate with a record number of mail-in ballots demands and immediate and thorough investigation.

ca53fa81	"SHARE By of the Sun Prairie - With the economy still struggling and his own political prospects in the balance, Gov. Scott Walker said Wednesday he would seek a bipartisan approach on a second special session of jobs bills. Saying lawmakers should focus on jobs like a laser beam, Walker said he wanted to pass by November roughly 30 bills written by both Republicans and Democrats and targeting everything from biotech companies to farm and trucking businesses. But consumer advocates and Democrats immediately raised red flags on some of the legislation, noting that one bill would require families and small businesses to subsidize lower power rates for large manufacturers, other bills were still just drafts, and some - which would loosen regulations on everything from piers to wetlands - wouldn't necessarily create any jobs. For now, the special session doesn't include the two highest-profile pieces of economic development legislation - a bill to boost venture capital investments and another to rewrite the state's mining regulations and permitting process. ""We just want to make it easier for all the people who want to come and grow and expand in Wisconsin . . . to get away from all the other stuff, all the other subjects debated around the Capitol that distract us from this,"" Walker said, speaking at the firm Thermal Spray Technologies. In his speech, Walker struck a conciliatory tone, noting that many jobs bills in a January special session received bipartisan support. The call to refocus on jobs follows a spring dominated by a divisive debate over the Republican governor's repeal of most union bargaining for public workers and a summer overshadowed by recall elections against nine state senators for their stances on that legislation. So far the disagreements are lingering, with Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau) taking the unusual step on Tuesday of refusing to appoint to a mining committee the senators recommended by Minority Leader Mark Miller (D-Monona). This year, the economic picture in Wisconsin and the country has been mixed. The state created a net total of 30,100 jobs between December and August, after accounting for seasonal differences in hiring, but the unemployment rate has risen to 7.9% from 7.5%. Democrats welcomed the focus on jobs but questioned whether some of the bills, such as one that dealt with piers and others to limit lawsuits, would accomplish that goal. They asked whether the bills should be part of a special session that allows them to be potentially moved more quickly. ""We want to see bills rushed that will create jobs. We want to see bills slowed down that do not have any promise for creating jobs now,"" said Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca (D-Kenosha), who has one of the bills on the list. Power rates The bill on utility discounts is being touted by Republican lawmakers as a tool to help Wisconsin's economy grow. The bill would expand a pilot program to offer a discount of nearly $5 million over five years to Mercury Marine, the final piece of a more than $120 million state-and-local financing package that helped the Fond du Lac engine maker decide not to move to Oklahoma. Charlie Higley, executive director of the ratepayers group Citizens' Utility Board, objected to a news release by Walker's office that referred to the bill as ""tax relief,"" saying that it dealt with utility rates and had nothing to do with taxes. Higley said that the proposed lower rates for certain large manufacturers would end up being paid for by what is essentially a hidden fee on other consumers. ""That's been prohibited for over 100 years because it's simply unfair to make ratepayers pay for discounts that go to other ratepayers,"" Higley said. A trade association of the state's largest power consumers backed the proposal. The bill ""would increase our competitiveness and help job creation efforts in Wisconsin. Many other regulated states across the country offer similar programs as part of their economic development tool kits,"" said Todd Stuart, executive director of the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group. The announcement highlighting the bill Wednesday came one day before the state Public Service Commission, controlled by two Walker appointees, is scheduled to vote on whether to award the utility bill discounts to Mercury Marine. Discounts for the engine maker were announced as part of a package that included funding from the state, county and city to persuade Mercury not to move its manufacturing from Wisconsin to Stillwater, Okla. The company ended up receiving $122.7 million in state, county, federal stimulus and local funding, but Alliant's request for Mercury to receive a rate break was never authorized. It has been challenged by the Citizens' Utility Board but supported by Stuart's group. At a May public hearing on the utility rate bill, We Energies and the Municipal Electric Utilities of Wisconsin joined CUB in raising concerns about the impact the utility rate legislation would have on small businesses, which would be funding discounts for larger ones. But Wisconsin Power & Light and manufacturers backed the bill, saying it would help Wisconsin attract businesses by giving it a tool that other states, including Iowa and Minnesota, have. Rep. Mark Honadel (R-South Milwaukee) said Wednesday the bill is being revised to address concerns raised at the hearing. Another proposal highlighted by Walker Wednesday would create a program to make grants and loans to biotech companies. Those would be paid for by redirecting the growth in income taxes withheld by businesses in that sector for their workers. That draft legislation would be capped at $50 million a year and run for 15 years or $500 million over the life of the program. Wetlands bill Walker's list also included draft legislation to allow for construction on wetlands if new wetlands are created in other locations. Rep. Brett Hulsey (D-Madison) said that he believes the draft bill would make it easier to allow so-called ""wetland mitigation"" - moving wetlands from one spot to another. He said he feared it was a backdoor effort to help mining company Gogebic Taconite of Hurley, which is proposing to construct a large iron ore mine in Ashland and Iron counties. But opponents of the current law say that the Department of Natural Resources has long inhibited commercial development by restricting what can be done on wetlands. Dan Johnson, an aide to Sen. Neal Kedzie (R-Elkhorn), a co-sponsor of the legislation, said the wetlands bill has nothing to do with mining. Another draft bill would make changes in how Wisconsin regulates the construction and size of piers on public waterways and grandfather in all existing docks on lakes and rivers. Pier regulation has also been controversial, with the DNR under the administration of former Gov. Jim Doyle saying that changes were needed to protect the sensitive shore area of water bodies and property owners saying they should be able to keep long-standing piers. Regulations approved in 2008 grandfathered most but not all piers, when the state set new standards on the size of new docks. This spring, the Legislature allowed pier owners one more year to meet the deadline to comply with the 2008 regulations. The new deadline is April 1, 2012. Democrats such as Barca questioned how that proposal could create any jobs at all. Walker spokesman Chris Schrimpf said that it was a measure to streamline regulation that ""has been worked on for a long time and made sense to be introduced as part of an overall package.""

fdddd52c	"Authorities in Australia have confirmed the bushfires were caused by arsonists and a series of lightning strikes, not “climate change” as many activists have claimed. Since November, the fires have devastated various regions in New South Wales, destroying thousands of buildings and killing at least 22 people. Summit.news reports: Despite the fact that bushfires are not uncommon in Australia, the severity of the damage led numerous climate change alarmists to blame the disaster on man-made global warming.
Earlier this week, Bernie Sanders blamed those who were “delaying action on climate change” for “the blood-red sky and unbreathable air in Australia because of raging forest fires.” However, according to those tasked with investigating the fires, climate change has nothing to do with it. @7NewsSydney Police are now working on the premise arson is to blame for much of the devastation caused this bushfire season. A strike force will investigate whether blazes were deliberately lit, and bring those responsible to justice. http://7NEWS.com.au @ebatten7 #NSWFires #7NEWS Embedded video “Police are now working on the premise arson is to blame for much of the devastation caused this bushfire season,” reports 7 News Sydney. Authorities in the country have formed Strike Force Indarra, comprising of detectives from homicide and arson units in an attempt to find the culprits. Other causes for the fires include lightning strikes and a natural weather phenomenon called Dipole, again neither of which have anything to do with man-made climate change. Many bushfires are also actually caused by environmentalist ‘green’ policies which prevent land owners from clearing their own vegetation to protect themselves. “Governments appeasing the green beast have ignored numerous state and federal bushfire inquiries over the past decade, almost all of which have recommended increasing the practice of “prescribed burning,” writes Miranda Devine. “Also known as “hazard reduction”, it is a methodical regime of burning off flammable ground cover in cooler months, in a controlled fashion, so it does not fuel the inevitable summer bushfires.” As ever with climate change alarmists, they don’t let the facts get in the way of a good power grab."

Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice NHS hospital beds numbers have plunged by 20% over the past decade and left the health service at “breaking point”, the British Medical Association warned. Analysis by the BMA found the number of overnight beds in English hospitals fell by a fifth between 2006/7 and 2015/16. BMA chairman Mark Porter said: “The UK already has the second lowest number of hospital beds per head in Europe per head ,and these figures paint an even bleaker picture of an NHS that is at breaking point. “High bed occupancy is a symptom of wider pressure and demand on an overstretched and underfunded system. It causes delays in admissions, operations being cancelled and patients being unfairly and sometimes repeatedly let down.” The BMA’s new report found that in the first week of January this year, almost three-quarters of trusts had a bed occupancy rate of 95% on at least one day. According to the analysis, in 2000 there were an average of 3.8 beds per 1,000 people, but this had dropped to 2.4 beds by 2015. Image: Universal Images Group The report said that in November 2016, 14.8% of patients spent more than four hours waiting for a hospital bed, having been seen in an A&E department. “The data demonstrates the increasing pressures on the system,” Dr Porter said. “It provides evidence of the underlying cracks within the NHS, such as funding constraints, changes and increases in demand, disjointed care and workforce pressures,” the BMA report said. It noted that pressures on mental health services were particularly acute, with a 44% decrease in the number of mental health beds since 2000/01. The document was seized on by opposition politicians, with Labour saying it was a “wake-up call which Theresa May must not ignore” and the Liberal Democrats warning the situation was becoming “intolerable”. Image: Moment RF Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “Thanks to Tory mishandling of our NHS, patient numbers in hospitals are now routinely above the levels recommended for safety. The shameful reality is this overcrowding puts patients at risk and blows apart ministers’ claims to be prioritising safety. “The number of overnight hospital beds has decreased by over a fifth, and combined with Tory neglect and underfunding this has left nine out of 10 hospitals dangerously overcrowded this winter.” Lib Dem spokesman and former health minister Norman Lamb added: “Chronic bed shortages should be the exception not the rule. “The situation is getting intolerable, with more cancelled operations, longer delays and those with mental health issues being systematically let down. “The Government is failing to properly fund the NHS and patients are paying the price.” A NHS Improvement spokeswoman said: “The NHS has been under real pressure this winter, as it copes with a surge in demand for emergency services the knock-on effects are felt throughout our hospitals. “Our hospitals are extremely busy but we are working tirelessly alongside providers to help them manage and to support more efficient use of the number of beds available.”	State wise to wait and see fate of health reform law	partially false
5ce4da20	After 35 days of being replaced for vandalism, the memorial sign of Emmett Till has been filled with bullet holes again. What We Know: The Emmett Till memorial was put up by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, and resides outside of Glendale, Mississippi. According to TIME Magazine, this is the third time that the sign has been vandalized. To drive up and see it like that, I was sad,” said Patrick Weems, a founder of the Emmett Till Interpretive Center in Sumner, Miss. “When we finally replaced it, it was an amazing feeling that this sign that had been obliterated was finally restored.” The memorial was placed in honor of 14-year-old Till who was lynched, beaten and tortured by two white men, and then thrown in the Tallahatchie river. He was accused by a white woman, Carolyn Bryant, of whistling at her. The men where acquitted of his murder, and she recanted her story decades later after Till’s death. It was not until 2007, 52 years after Till’s death that he received his first memorial sign. It only lasted one year, before the sign was stolen and never returned, New York Times reports. Several signs have been replaced since the first one was stolen. Another was also shot, and the newest sign was replaced in June. No one has ever been caught for vandalizing the signs, but Mr. Weems says, “My sense is that it only takes one person to do this.” Mr. Weems says that there are talks of a new sign being being designed and made out of steel to be better than before. The Emmett Till foundation continues it’s journey to preserve his legacy.	Photographer reveals story behind iconic image of fleeing migrants at Mexico border	other
dd4501d6	"The rookie politician’s first month looks a lot like his campaign. Congressman Conor Lamb was an unknown quantity when he won a special election in March that he wasn’t supposed to win, having run as a Democrat even Reaganites could love and refusing to fully toe the partisan line. It was a question of how all that would translate in elected office. He had no political experience and no voting record to point to and only platform points and campaign vows to serve as reference material. A month later, and that has changed. In the first weeks of what is to be a very brief term representing the 18th Congressional District — portions of which belong to Allegheny, Westmoreland, Greene and Washington counties — Lamb has voted with his fellow Democrats in the House and at times with the Republican majority. He’s voted in favor of measures to extend hate crime protections to law enforcement officers and against a Farm Bill containing controversial new work requirements for food stamp recipients. He’s voted with Congressman Keith Rothfus, Lamb’s Republican opponent in the ongoing race for Pennsylvania’s newly drawn 17th Congressional District, and against him. So the question is: If Lamb was billed as a political maverick, a moderate in immoderate times, does his voting record reflect that? Here we look at the votes cast by Lamb in his first weeks in office and preview what his votes might look like as a more permanent member of the U.S. House if he’s elected to represent the 17th in November. Multiple requests for comment were not returned. Legislation U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb - Democrat U.S. Rep.

The Volcker Rule was passed as part of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010 under President Barack Obama and was meant to protect bank customers by preventing institutions from making certain types of speculative investments that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. According to the New York Times, “the Volcker Rule, named for the former chairman of the Federal Reserve […] prohibited banks from making their own risky bets with their customers’ deposits. Banks loathed the rule and Republicans vowed to undo it.” The bill works by allowing thousands of small and midsize banks to avoid tougher oversight and, per the Washington Post, “also loosens rules aimed at protecting the biggest banks from sudden collapse.” The Post also reported that Paul Volcker, the former Fed chairman for whom the rule is named, criticized a similar bill in the U.S. Senate, saying “plausibly small loopholes can be ‘gamed’ and exploited with unfortunate consequences.” In the end, congressional Republicans succeeded with the help of Democrats like Lamb who was one of 78 Democrats to vote for the rollback. One hundred and fifteen Democrats cast votes against the rule change or didn’t vote at all, according to govtrack.us. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted to rollback the rule and later said at a town hall that his vote was based on the burden the regulation presented for smaller banks that he said don’t engage in the type of risky trading that the big banks did before the financial crisis of 2008, TribLive reported. Under the bill, community banks are defined as those without a controlling entity with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets and total trading assets and trading liability that are more than 5 percent of total consolidated assets. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus also voted in favor of the rollback. Where does it stand? The bill was passed by the House and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, according to congress.gov. S. 2155 – Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act What is it? The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act is a more sweeping rollback of Dodd-Frank provisions. It aims to “ease the regulatory burden for small and midsize banks,” the same banks that argue the tougher regulations spurred by the 2008 financial crisis have unfairly made it more difficult for them to operate and compete. This includes community banks whose customers include small businesses, which critics of Dodd-Frank argue have been hurt by curtailed lending to small companies following the passage of Dodd-Frank in 2010. Critics of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, meanwhile, argue that it could embolden some of the financial sector’s worst tendencies, the same that contributed to or caused the financial collapse of 2008. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against the measure, joining the vast majority of Democrats. In a press release, Lamb said of the bill: “With common-sense regulations in place to protect the money that consumers deposit, people can have more confidence that their bank will better protect their investments. Banks today are experiencing record-setting profits and it’s only fair that we continue to protect the interests of the taxpayers and avoid another bailout.” WESA described this as Lamb “straddling the partisan divide with two votes on bank rules.” How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus voted for the measure, joining almost all of his fellow Republicans. In a statement, Rothfus said: “Since the end of the financial crisis, we have seen an average of one community bank or credit union disappear every day. This has meant that consumers have faced higher costs and reduced access to vital financial products. By fixing misguided rules from Washington, this bill will help consumers and small businesses access the financial services they need to live their version of the American Dream.” Where does it stand? President Trump signed the bill into law Thursday. H.R. 5698 – Protect and Serve Act of 2018 What is it? The Protect and Serve Act of 2018 is modeled after a federal hate crime statute and would make it a crime to intentionally target a law enforcement officer based on his “actual or perceived status” as one, CNN reports. Supporters say the bill sends a clear signal that violence against law enforcement officers will not be tolerated. Critics say the language of the bill is too broad and effectively designates any violence against officers a federal hate crime. They also argue that it perpetuates a false narrative of a “war on police” and that police already have substantial protections under state and federal law and do not qualify as a historically persecuted group. How did Lamb vote? Lamb, whose background as a federal prosecutor and Marine Corps JAG officer were regular features of his campaign, voted in favor of the bill. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He was one of 162 Democrats to vote in favor of the bill, while 24 voted against it and seven didn’t vote, according to govtrack.us. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus also voted in favor of the measure. There were 220 Republicans who cast yes votes for the legislation, 11 who did not, and three who didn’t vote at all. All of the bill’s sponsors were Republicans. Where does it stand? The bill passed the House and has been referred to the Senate’s Committee on the Judiciary. H.R. 2152 – Citizens’ Right to Know Act of 2018 What is it? This bill requires a state or local government that receives funds under a Department of Justice (DOJ) grant program and uses such funds for a pretrial services program to annually report to DOJ the amount of money allocated for the pretrial services program and certain information about participating defendants. DOJ must publish the information. Additionally, DOJ must reduce the grant allocation of a state or local government that fails to comply. Supporters argue the bill would provide greater transparency in how federal funds are used by local governments. Critics, including the ACLU, NAACP and Human Rights Watch, say the bill presents “serious privacy concerns” and also “undermines efforts to eliminate or reduce jurisdictions’ reliance on money bail systems.” How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against the measure, joining a majority of Democrats. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus voted yes, along with all but 8 Republican voters in the House. What happened? The bill passed the House and has been referred to the Senate’s Committee on the Judiciary. H.R. 5645 – Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2018 What is it? According to Law 360: The SMARTER Act would eliminate differences between the DOJ and FTC’s approaches to merger challenges by requiring the FTC to litigate contested merger challenges in federal court, rather than through its administrative review process. Proponents of the SMARTER Act argue that it provides greater certainty for companies by reconciling the disparate processes used by the FTC and DOJ. Opponents view the proposal as an attack on the FTC’s ability to properly carry out its duties, unnecessarily weakening the FTC by removing this enforcement tool from its powers. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against the measure, joining all but four Democrats. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus voted in favor of the measure in what amounted to a party-line vote. Where does it stand? H.R. 5645 passed the House and was referred to the Senate’s Committee on the Judiciary. H.R. 2: Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (Farm Bill) What is it? The Farm Bill is a multi-year spending bill covering an array of agricultural and food programs — everything from farm commodity price and income supports, agricultural conservation, farm credit, trade, research, rural development, bioenergy, foreign food aid, and domestic nutrition assistance, the Congressional Research Service reports. This year’s proposal was controversial for its proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the proposed addition of work requirements for SNAP recipients. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against the measure with all 183 Democrats who cast votes May 18. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus also voted no, joining only 30 Republican lawmakers who opposed the measure. “While this bill began necessary reforms to agriculture and nutrition programs, in an era of a nearly $21 trillion national debt, more reforms are needed,” Rothfus said in a statement. “Congress needs to be very careful in how it spends hard-earned taxpayer dollars. This bill was a missed opportunity for serious reforms of agricultural subsidy programs.” Of the 30 Republicans to vote no on the Farm Bill proposal, NPR reports many are members of the House Freedom Caucus and that they voted no after failing to get concessions on spending and a future vote on immigration in exchange for their support. Rothfus was a member of the House Freedom Caucus until resigning in 2016. Where does the bill stand? The bill failed in the House in a 198-213 and has yet to be scheduled for further proceedings. H.R. 3053 – Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2018 What is it? H.R. 3053 is a bill to authorize the Department of Energy to resume a plan — halted under the Obama administration — to build the Yucca Mountain facility to store radioactive nuclear waste. Supporters of H.R. 3053 say waste is piling up at power plants nationwide because Yucca Mountain is unavailable. Critics point to safety concerns and “government bullying” in explaining their opposition. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted for the bill to restart the program, joining 221 Republicans and 119 members of his own party. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus also voted in favor of the bill. Where does it stand? Referred to Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. H.R. 3144 – To provide for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a specified period of time, and for other purposes What is it? The bill, sponsored by U.S. Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Spokane, would reverse a federal judge’s order calling for more springtime spill over on dams along the Columbia and Snake Rivers in the Northwest to protect endangered salmon. The bill would lock in place management plans that the judge found violated federal environmental laws, according to High Country News. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against it along with 181 out of a total 189 voting Democrats. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus voted for the measure, joining all but 8 Republican voters in the House. Where does it stand? The bill passed the House and has been referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works."	Large proportion of those referred to UK deradicalisation scheme are under 18	partially false

It other words, our doctrine provides for no right to preemptive strike, Peskov stressed, adding that Russia reserves the right to a nuclear strike only in case it is attacked with the use of nuclear weapons or attacked in a way that jeopardizes the mere existence of the state. It means we will never be the first to attack anyone. This is what the president said. But if we come under attack, then everyone will go where he or she should - either to heaven or to hell, or elsewhere. This is what he meant, the rest was allegory, he said. In his speech at a session of the Valdai International Discussion Club last Thursday, Putin said, among other things, that Russia’s concept is retaliation against the aggressor. An aggressor must know that retaliation is inevitable and it will be destroyed. And we, the victims of the aggression, we like martyrs will get into the heaven while they will simply die immediately because they will even have no time to repent, Putin said.

5a2459c3	"A measure to limit Florida school board member terms has gained the support of the two men seeking the Republican nomination to become the state's next governor. They did not weigh in, though, on the other two provisions the concept is tied to as it heads to the November ballot. U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, a Jacksonville Republican in his third term, isn't one to talk much about Florida-specific issues. He did, however, take time to publicize his position on school board term limits, perhaps the most popular of the three ideas in the constitutional amendment. It also asks voters to require civics literacy program in public schools, and to allow the Legislature to create new education models outside the control of local school boards. ""No elected office, whether federal or local, is ever better off when run by career politicians,"" DeSantis, a three-term House member from Jacksonville, wrote in a piece for the U.S. Term Limits website. ""That's why I support eight-year term limits for all school board members,"" continued DeSantis, who also has sponsored legislation to limit Congressional terms. ""I am confident this proposal would bring new energy and ideas to school boards, which too often suffer from the same untamed incumbency that paralyzes Congress."" Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, by most accounts a the candidate more likely to focus on policy details, shared that point of view. ""If term limits are good enough for the governor and the Legislature, they're good enough for school boards,"" Putnam said via email. Supporters of Amendment 8, the Constitution Revision Commission's education-focused ballot question, have focused attention on the term limits portion. The new political committee backing the measure this week referred to the proposal in its press release as being about ""school board term limits and other K-12 policy."" It's that ""other"" part that has opponents most concerned. They have taken to social media to complain that the section ""amending Section 4 of Article IX of the State Constitution to specify which schools are operated, controlled, and supervised by a school board"" could establish a second level of public schools run without local control, with appointed boards based in Tallahassee or elsewhere. The original language, before the Constitution Revision Commission amended it, spoke directly of a state charter school authorizer.

10cfd37c	"HON. STEFAN I. MYCHAJLIW ERIE COUNTY COMPTROLLER’S OFFICE DIVISION OF AUDIT & CONTROL 95 FRANKLIN STREET BUFFALO, NEW YORK 14202 January 29, 2021 Erie County Legislature 92 Franklin Street 4th Floor Buffalo, New York 14202 Dear Honorable Members: The Erie County Comptroller’s Office has completed a report on certain personnel and food expenses charged to fund 252, commonly known as CARES Act relief for municipalities. Our objectives were to: Update the amount of expenses for overtime attributed to fund 252. List Managerial Confidential recipients of overtime payments. Update the amount expended for food from fund 252. To accomplish these objectives, we reviewed expenses attributed to fund 252. This report serves as both an update to previous reports regarding overtime expensed to fund 252, as well as food expenses. A meeting scheduled prior to the August break to discuss overtime was postponed, with the intent to meet soon for the discussion. To date, this meeting has not yet been rescheduled. This updated information may be useful at such a discussion when it occurs. Further, the updated information will be useful in any discussions concerning food purchased using fund 252, especially food for employees. Background On March 25, 2020, the United States Senate passed the “Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act” (CARES) as amended. The United States House of Representatives approved the measure on the following day, and the bill was signed into law on March 27, 2020.
The CARES Act provided significant aid to local governments to combat COVID-19. Erie County received $160 million in federal funding. Erie County created a special fund to account for expenses permissibly reimbursed by CARES Act governmental funding. The fund is identified as fund 252. The money in fund 252 can be used for various purposes related to combatting COVID 19. These purposes include wages to individuals who tasks are to substantially address COVID 19, outfitting offices and other areas to reduce potential exposure to COVID-19, fortifying capacity to work remotely to avoid exposure to COVID-19, and supplies and protective gear to guard against COVID-19, to name just a few permissible uses. As stated, a permissible use of CARES Act funding is to pay employees whose efforts are substantially devoted to addressing COVID-19. As a result, some employees have been hired specifically for such tasks, while others have been authorized overtime for such tasks. The tasks needed to address COVID-19 are varied, and may be different from tasks typically undertaken by employees in their daily activities. At the time of passage, municipalities were required to spend the funds by December 31, 2020. In December, 2020, the deadline was extended so that funds that were determined to not be needed in 2020 must now be expended by December 31, 2021. At the prompting of legislature questions and commentary, our office has previously submitted reports quantifying overtime and holiday worked pay expended to MC employees, overtime and holiday worked pay expended to employees represented by bargaining units, pay for employees who did not report to work and were unable to perform work remotely, the utilization of the imprest fund for expenditures charged to fund 252, and the use of fund 252 for food purchases for individuals quarantining due to COVID-19, as well as employees who report to work. This report focuses serves as an update on overtime, including holiday worked overtime, associated with fund 252, as well as expenditures for food charged to fund 252. It synthesizes, as well as updates, information previously provided. CARES Act Guidance Regarding Expenditures Guidance provided by the United States Treasury Department regarding the CARES Act (updated January 15, 2021) in its Coronavirus Relief Fund Guidance for State, Territorial, Local, and Tribal Governments states that: The CARES Act provides that payments from the Fund may only be used to cover costs that – 1. are necessary expenditures incurred due to the public health emergency with respect to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19); 2. were not accounted for in the budget most recently approved as of March 27, 2020 (the date of enactment of the CARES Act) for the State or government; and 3. were incurred during the period that begins on March 1, 2020, and ends on December 30, 2021. The previous deadline for expending CARES Act funds was December 31, 2020; however, the deadline was extended by a year pursuant to section 1001 of Division N of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. Further, “[t]he statute also specifies that expenditures using Fund payments must be ‘necessary.’ The Department of the Treasury understands this term broadly to mean that the expenditure is reasonably necessary for its intended use in the reasonable judgment of the government officials responsible for spending Fund payments.” Overtime For the purposes of this report, overtime will refer to both overtime and holiday worked overtime charged to fund 252. As of the pay period ending January 1, 2021 and paid on January 8, 2021, 1,226 employees have charged 114,524 hours of overtime to fund 252, resulting in an expenditure of $5,898,195. Of this amount, $1,362,396 has been paid to 56 MC employees. This amounts to 23.1% of overtime payments to employees. MC employees comprise 6.5% of the county workforce. While the process for allocating overtime to union represented employees is outlined in labor contracts, MC employees are not bound to the terms of those contracts for overtime assignment purposes. The following are overtime payments in excess of $10,000 made to MC employees from fund 252: Office Title Hours Amount Health Commissioner of Health 1266 $183,414

Of the MC employees receiving more than $10,000 in overtime payments, 14 ultimately report to the County Executive and 13 ultimately report to the Sheriff. Although paid overtime for most MC employees was unusual prior to March, 2020, a recently implemented policy has increased the amount of compensatory time that MC employees may accumulate to 200 hours.
CARES Act Guidance Regarding Meals
In the only reference to food in the previously mentioned guidance, it states “Expenses of actions to facilitate compliance with COVID-19-related public health measures, such as: Expenses for food delivery to residents, including, for example, senior citizens and other vulnerable populations, to enable compliance with COVID-19 public health precautions.” It does not mention food expenses for employees. This guidance clearly permits food expenses for individuals housed in the hotel rented by the County for individuals with no other safe housing options and who are battling COVID-19. This qualification as a permissible expense is bolstered by the guidance listing among permissible expenses “expenses for quarantining individuals.”
However, it does not provide entire clarity as to the permissibility of paying for food for employees out of fund 252. Certainly, such expenditures qualify in that they were not otherwise budgeted to occur. Erie County does not typically provide food for employees who arrive for work and are present during a typical meal time. However, given legal and contractual requirements regarding break time for meals, questions may arise as to whether such expenditures are “necessary.” Further, listed examples of ineligible expenditures include “[w]orkforce bonuses other than hazard pay or overtime.” Although bonuses are typically thought of as extraordinary cash payments above and beyond salary, the definition of bonus may also include the provision of food not typically provided to employees in their compensation package. As such, WE RECOMMEND that clarification be sought from the federal government as to whether the CARES Act permits reimbursement for food expenses for employees while at work. Particular guidance should be requested regarding employees who are working their normal shift, which ordinarily includes a meal period.
New York State Guidance Regarding Meals
In order to properly reimburse for meals, proper documentation is necessary. These documents typically include an invoice, receipt or some other document which evidences what food was delivered and paid for, a statement of the purpose of the meeting, and a description (list) of the individuals in attendance.
The New York State Office of the Comptroller has opined that meal expenses are a proper charge to local governments if the local official is traveling outside of his or her regular work area on official business for an extended period of time or is prevented from taking time off for meals due to a pressing need to complete the business at hand. Clarifying this, the Comptroller opined that when the local government is faced with business of an immediate nature and meetings are essential at mealtime, meals would be a proper local government charge. However, the cost of meals while performing the usual duties of the position within the local government is generally a personal expense. Further, the Office of the New York State Comptroller has ruled that a municipality may make reasonable expenditures for refreshments which are incidental to a lawful municipal purpose. Examples of such expenditures include refreshments for senior citizens incidental to a recreation program; refreshments for the general public attending an official town function, and refreshments for volunteer firefighters at the scene of a serious fire.
Information available in the County’s SAP system, which is our data processing system, does not provide sufficient information to determine if the expenditures were appropriate charges to local government. Departments submitting invoices for payment are responsible for attaching documentation which supports the expenditure to be paid. The supporting documentation should be attached electronically in SAP, along with the corresponding invoice. For example, for many of the expenditures, there was not sufficient information to determine what was actually purchased, which individuals received the meals and why the food purchase was necessary. Further, the descriptions include entries such as “lunch for fire academy,” “dinner for 9th floor phone bank,” “food for Rath EOC – various days,” “groceries for OPS room,” and “supplies for warehouse.” These vague descriptions do not provide enough information to evaluate if there was participation in meetings that were essential at meal time or if there was a concern of an immediate nature.
Because COVID-19 has been present in the community since March, it may be difficult to determine that the reason for the meal was of an immediate nature. Further, there may not be support for the necessity of scheduling meetings during mealtimes. In fact, there are very few mentions of food being for meetings, regardless of whether they were required to occur during mealtimes. Also, it appears from the vague descriptions that many times meals could be provided for employees for performing the work that they are there to perform, i.e. – the usual duties of the position.
Further, given contractual and legal requirements, employees must be given breaks for meals. Failure to offer such breaks, especially on a continued basis, may subject the County to liability for violations of labor law or grievances. If the employees are being given their required meal breaks, they have time to consume meals brought from home, delivered to their work site or picked-up from a nearby restaurant. The fact that food is being delivered to the worksites is an indication that employees have the capability to secure food from a restaurant, if they so choose.
Given New York State guidance, as well as contractual and legal obligations, WE RECOMMEND that clarification be sought as to whether it is permissible for employees to be provided with meals at government expense.
Summary of Expenditures
A representative list of food expenditures is attached as Appendix A. The list is a compilation of food expenditures actually paid through December 31, 2020. It does not include items for which invoices were received, but not yet paid. The total amount of food expenditures using the fund 252 is $239,689. Prior reports on food listed several observations. These observations included:
Sales Tax Paid: Erie County is a sales tax exempt entity. Sales tax paid was noted on several receipts. It is understood that some restaurants do not accept tax exempt certificates. However, retailers such as BJs Wholesale do accept such certificates. Efforts should be considered to minimize sales tax paid using taxpayer dollars.
Purchases of Non-Food Items: Among the purchases reimbursed were cooking implements, including burners, pots, pans, spatulas, and cutlery. These purchases, made by the warehouse, were then followed by the purchase of food, including uncooked meat. It may be surmised that the raw meat was then cooked using the kitchen equipment. If true, this may be not be appropriate for reimbursement from CARES Act funding, and may also be in violation of New York State Comptroller guidance. If an employee has time to prepare a meal from scratch, it is hard to argue that meals were necessary due to an immediate need of the job. It is advisable to determine whether these expenditures were necessary and appropriate.
Purchases Prior to CARES Act: As stated above, CARES Act funding for municipalities can be used for eligible expenditures between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. A receipt reimbursed to Health Department – Bioterrorism was dated February 18, 2020, and another on February 22, 2020. These would seem to be outside of the parameters for CARES Act spending.
Communal Food: Many of the food items purchased for consumption were communal in nature, meaning that the food was meant to be shared by multiple people. An example of shared communal food would be a sheet pizza or sandwich platter. The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), in documenting recommendations for returning to work during the COVID-19 emergency, states that “[e]mployers and employees should not provide communal meals to employees, and should not make food available in common areas where employees may congregate.” As such, communal food should be discouraged. Notably, a large amount of food purchased does appear to be individually packaged meals.
Possible Duplicate Payment – Wellington Pub: On the entire list of entries, there were entries recorded depicting credits or refunds for overpayments made in error. This is not an uncommon practice during a reconciliation process. It was observed that a payment was made to Wellington Pub for 55 box lunches delivered to the SH Hotel on May 3, 2020, with a check number of 5716 (reference number 05032020-0001). It was also observed that a payment was made to Wellington Pub for 55 box lunches delivered to the SH Hotel on May 3, 2020, with a check number of 5716 (reference number 2020VF-119). A corresponding credit was not noted. It may be advisable to confirm that payments were made properly.
Duplicate Payment - ECC: It was observed that a payment was made to ECC Food Service for 72 Swedish meatball dinners picked up on May 13, 2020 (reference number 400-4847). It was also observed that a payment was made to ECC Food Service for 72 Swedish meatball dinners picked up on May 13, 2020 (reference number 400-7847). The two pick-ups would represent roughly double the amount of dinners picked-up from ECC Food Service on days around that time. Further, typically only one pick-up occurred daily from ECC Food Service. A corresponding credit was not noted. It may be advisable to confirm that payments were made properly.
Delivery expenses: The majority of food purchased was delivered, with delivery included in the final cost. Some food was picked-up. The cost of the food picked-up does not include the cost of labor or other resources used to retrieve the food. Although not known, it is possible that some individuals received overtime for the time spent picking-up food. As such, any analysis of food costs should consider the unreported costs.
Supporting Information Not Available on SAP: As stated above, there is a lack of documentation available on SAP. Some items do not have receipts attached to SAP to determine what was actually purchased. Other items provide important information, such as items purchased, cost per unit, date, location, etc., however there is no information as to the number of individuals consuming the purchased food. The lack of such readily available information could prove problematic in a future audit.
The above concerns have not yet been addressed to the Comptroller’s Office. In fact, certain concerns continue, such as the purchase of raw food products for the warehouse, most recently in November.
Conclusions
The CARES Act provides Erie County with $160 million to combat COVID-19. The funds are to be used for COVID-19 related expenses that were not otherwise anticipated in the budget. The Comptroller’s Office has previously provided updates to the Legislature concerning certain aspects of CARES Act spending, at the request of the Legislature. This report serves as an update to those previous reports.
As of the pay period ending January 1, 2021 and paid on January 8, 2021, 1,226 employees have charged 114,524 hours of overtime to fund 252, resulting in an expenditure of $5,898,195. Of this amount, $1,362,396 has been paid to 56 MC employees. The highest recipient of overtime received $183,414. This amount, compared to base the pay of all Erie County employees, would put that employee in the top five of over 4,700 employees. That top five list would also include that employee’s base salary of $202,312. A previous report to the legislature noted the comparatively low use of overtime for MC employees across New York State, when compared to Erie County. Most counties, including Erie County’s typical comparator counties, did not pay overtime to MC employees at all.
As of December 31, 2020, fund 252 expenditures for food total $239,689. This amount includes a high percentage spent on food for employees. Further, observations were made questioning the propriety of the spending.
As such, WE RECOMMEND that the propriety of using CARES Act funds to supply employee meals be examined, with particular attention given to the CARES Act, New York State Comptroller guidance, labor law and contractual obligations. Further, WE RECOMMEND that the observations made in Comm. 16D-1 (2020) be reviewed and any necessary corrections be made. In addition, WE RECOMMEND that steps be taken to reduce the usage of tax dollars for the payment of sales tax. WE RECOMMEND that overtime policies be revisited to make sure that payments were consistent with policies that existed at the time of payment. WE RECOMMEND that policies and safeguards be examined to determine how better to protect taxpayer money.

96b47cba	White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Monday repeatedly deflected reporters’ questions about gun control, saying “there will certainly be a time for that policy discussion to take place, but that’s not the place that we’re in at this moment.” During the same media briefing, however, Sanders weighed in on the exact “policy discussion” that she said the White House would not engage in on “a day of mourning.” “I think one of the things that we don’t want to do is try to create laws that won’t create — or stop these types of things from happening,” Sanders said. “I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn’t helped there. So, I think we have to, when that time comes for those conversations to take place, then I think we have to look at things that may actually have a real impact.” This is the White House not talking about gun control. Here’s how frustrated Democrats have responded to Las Vegas As fact checkers have consistently pointed out, the claim that Chicago has “the strictest gun laws in the country” — one that Trump himself used in a presidential debate last fall — is outdated and has not been true since 2013. It is true, however, that the city’s gun-control regulations remain among the strictest in the nation, yet there were 4,368 shooting victims in Chicago last year, and there have been 2,877 this year. Later, Sanders responded to Hillary Clinton’s suggestion that a House bill that would ease restrictions on gun silencers could make attacks like the one Stephen Paddock carried out in Las Vegas even more deadly by dampening an audible cue that alerts potential targets. “I haven’t spoken with the president about that specific issue, but I don’t think that that is something that would have changed” the outcome, Sanders said. (An expert The Washington Post’s Philip Bump consulted suggests Sanders is probably right on this point.) “Again, I think before we start trying to talk about the preventions of what took place last night we need to know more facts,” Sanders continued. “And right now, we’re simply not at that point. It’s very easy for Mrs. Clinton to criticize and to come out, but I think we need to remember the only person with blood on their hands is that of the shooter.” During the briefing, NBC’s Hallie Jackson noted that “after the Orlando shooting, the president that day was out on Twitter talking about policy; he was talking about his travel ban.” Jackson was right: It is hard for the White House to say the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting is not the time to talk about policy because of the precedent set by Trump. Apparently it also is hard for Trump’s team to resist talking about policy, even when it insists that “today is a day for consoling the survivors and mourning those we lost.” There is nothing inherently wrong with Sanders stating the president’s positions on gun control. Democrats are certainly declaring their own. But the idea that the White House refuses to discuss the issue so soon after tragedy does not match reality.

53eabb9b	"Trade agreements and pressure on India’s ‘pharmacy of the developing world’ pose major threats to access Durban, 21 July 2016 — The international medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières today released the 18th edition of its HIV drug pricing report, Untangling the Web of Antiretroviral Price Reductions, at the International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa. The report finds that prices of older HIV drugs continue to decline, while newer drugs remain largely priced out of reach. This is in large part because pharmaceutical corporations maintain monopolies that block price-lowering generic competition. Today, the lowest available price for a quality-assured, World Health Organization-recommended first-line one-pill-a-day combination is US$100 per person per year (tenofovir/emtricitabine/efavirenz). This is a decrease of 26% since MSF last recorded the lowest price for first-line treatment at $136 in 2014. For a WHO-recommended second-line regimen, the lowest available price is now $286 per person per year (zidovudine/lamivudine + atazanavir/ritonavir)—an 11% decrease from $322 two years ago. These prices continue to fall as a result of robust competition among generics manufacturers in key producing countries, primarily India. But the price of newer drugs—needed for people who have run out of other HIV treatment options—remain high, largely because of patent monopolies held by drug corporations. The lowest price for salvage treatment today is $1,859 per person per year (raltegravir + darunavir/ritonavir + etravirine). This is more than 18 times the price of first-line therapy, and more than six times the price of today’s most affordable second-line combination. The price for this combination has come down only by seven percent, from $2,006 per year in 2014. These are the lowest global prices, but many countries, especially ‘middle-income’ countries, pay much higher prices for these medicines because pharmaceutical patents block them from using generics. "" the price of newer drugs—needed for people who have run out of other HIV treatment options—remain high, largely because of patent monopolies held by drug corporations."" “We have to be able to afford the newer HIV drug combinations that people will need over time, or else they will have no other options,” said Dr. Vivian Cox, Medical Referent for MSF’s Eshowe project in South Africa “We need to be shouting about this now to make sure we don’t end up with another treatment crisis like the one we faced over a decade ago, when life-saving medicines were simply priced out of reach for millions of people who needed them.” While today the number of people who require salvage therapy is still relatively small in developing countries, the increased use of gold-standard viral load treatment monitoring is helping identify more people who are failing on their first- or second-line treatment and need to be switched to another set of medicines. Already in MSF’s HIV programmes, the number of people having moved to second-line therapy has almost doubled since 2013. India, the world’s main producer of affordable HIV medicines, is often called the ‘pharmacy of the developing world.’ More than 97% of the HIV medicines MSF uses in its treatment programmes are generic medicines from India. India’s patent law sets a high bar for what deserves a patent. This allows robust competition among generic producers, which has driven down first-line HIV treatment prices by 99% -- from $10,000 per person per year in 2000, to $100 today. But India is facing immense pressure to roll back its pro-health patent policies—which put people’s lives over corporate profits—especially from the United States, backed by its pharmaceutical corporation lobby. Other countries, such as the EU, along with Japan and South Korea, are preparing or actively pursuing trade agreements with India that would restrict the country’s production of affordable medicines in the future. Should India be forced to change its policies for these trade agreements, it could pose a serious threat to affordable medicines production in India. “India is under massive pressure to turn off its tap of affordable medicines, which are a lifeline to millions of people not only in India, but across the developing world,” said Leena Menghaney, South Asia Head of MSF’s Access Campaign. “If India doesn’t stand strong against the pharmaceutical corporations and governments that are pushing for change in the country’s patent law and policies, people around the world will face a crisis in access to medicines in the future. Download the full report here. In June 2015, MSF launched a campaign urging India to protect its status as the 'pharmacy of the developing world'. Millions of people in developing countries could be affected if India caves in to pressure."

bf3f6fdb	MOSCOW, August 13. /TASS/. The United States’ intention to take sanctions against Russia over the Skirpals affair pose a threat to the integrity of the Chemical Weapons Convention CWC and harm the authority of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued on Monday. Read also Kremlin mum on possible tit-for-tat measures in response to recent US sanctions Washington’s current actions harm the CWC integrity and the authority of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, with which Russia cooperated most closely in the process of implementing the national program for the elimination of chemical weapons, the Foreign Ministry said. The United States has more than once demonstrated its contemptuous attitude to the system of international law and the wish to use the existing multilateral arms control mechanisms for advancing its own political agenda. Hypocritical position The Foreign Ministry recalled that the United States tries to incriminate Russia of an act of using chemical weapons in the so-called Skripal case. Nobody has been able to present any evidence of this yet. In defiance of our repeated requests the British side has refused to cooperate in investigating the March 4 incident in Salisbury, the Foreign Ministry said. The US Department of State in its notification to Russia questions the full elimination of the Russian chemical weapons arsenal. They prefer to ignore the fact that the Russian program for the elimination of chemical weapons, completed last year, was implemented under strict international control in strict compliance with the CWC, the Foreign Ministry said. We regard the groundless charges of complicity in the Salisbury incident, put forward against Russia, as yet another attempt to create an impression our country takes an irresponsible attitude to compliance with international commitments, the statement runs. This approach looks particularly hypocritical in a situation where the United States is in no hurry to eliminate its own arsenal of chemical weapons and remains the sole CWC signatory that keeps considerable amounts of chemical warfare agents.

905519d3	Diabetes prescriptions are costing the NHS in England more than £1 billion a year, according to figures from NHS Digital. The total cost of the prescriptions has risen significantly - by more than £422 million - in the last 10 years. Almost one in 20 prescriptions written by GPs are now for diabetes treatment. The biggest increases are seen in treatments for type 2 diabetes, which affects around 90% of diabetes patients. Robin Hewings, head of policy at the charity Diabetes UK, said the figures reflect a dramatic rise in the incidence of diabetes. The number of people diagnosed with diabetes has doubled in the last 20 years, and it is responsible for 26,000 early deaths per year alongside serious complications such as blindness, amputation or stroke. This data shows that diabetes prescribing costs £1bn, but it is estimated that the total cost to the NHS is over £10bn a year, so the real price we have to pay for diabetes is not medications, but the devastating and expensive complications. Mr Hewings pointed out that drug costs have not risen significantly during this period, and that the increase in prescribing costs is largely a result of the rise in prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes signs 'detectable years earlier' 'Postcode lottery' for diabetes monitors Diabetes 'info prescription' plan Presentational grey line The rise in diabetes There are now over three million people in England with a diagnosis of diabetes. The number has doubled over the last two decades and there are nearly 100,000 diagnoses per year. 92% of recorded diagnoses of diabetes relate to type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes, unlike type 1, is closely linked to lifestyle factors and is preventable through lifestyle change. Almost seven out of 10 men are overweight or obese 66.8% and almost six out of 10 women are overweight or obese 57.8% in England. Source: NHS England Presentational grey line Type 2 diabetes is caused by the body not producing enough insulin, or by the body's cells not reacting to the insulin that is present, resulting in high blood sugar. It may be controlled by diet, or by antidiabetic drugs or insulin, or both. Type 2 is caused by a variety of factors, some of which are out of people's control, but more than 80 percent is caused by obesity or being overweight. In overweight and obese people, type 2 diabetes can be prevented and reversed by losing weight. The NHS England figures also include the cost of devices used by people with diabetes to monitor their condition. Nearly £477 million was spent on antidiabetic drugs in 2017-18. Over the same year, around £350 million was spent on insulin, and £181 million on diagnostic and monitoring devices. Professor Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity at NHS England, said: Thanks to better diagnosis and treatment, the NHS is caring for more people than ever before with diabetes, and this new data highlights the urgent need to prevent type 2 diabetes from developing in the first place. The NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme has now reached over a quarter of a million people at high risk of type 2 diabetes.

da910b12	As a father, I have felt the heartbreak of drug abuse. My daughter Noelle suffered from addiction, and like many parents facing similar situations, her mom and I struggled to help. I have so many friends and know so many families who have faced this terrible challenge. Addiction crosses all barriers, all lines, all races and all incomes. It creates real hardship and heartbreak in families. And, it places substantial demands on government at every level. I never expected to see my precious daughter in jail. It wasn’t easy, and it became very public when I was Governor of Florida, making things even more difficult for Noelle. She went through hell, so did her mom, and so did I. It’s very debilitating when you have a loved one who is struggling, and you can’t control it. You have to love them, but you also have to make it clear you cannot enable the behavior that gets them in trouble. Showing a lot of courage, Noelle graduated from drug court. Drug courts use a restorative solution model involving multi-disciplinary coordination, including the judiciary, the prosecution, mental health specialists, social services and treatment professionals. I was the proud dad that saw Noelle finish that. She’s drug-free now. As Governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent. As President, I will lead this country to dramatically reduce drug abuse. The country’s massive heroin and illicit drug epidemic is compounded and fueled by sharp increases in the abuse of prescription painkillers. The problem is exacerbated by huge increases in the availability of cheap, highly potent heroin, primarily the result of Mexican drug cartels getting involved in the production, trafficking and distribution of heroin and other illicit drugs. Some label the drug abuse epidemic just a criminal justice issue, and some try to make it just a health care issue. Both approaches oversimplify this complex and heartbreaking challenge. It is imperative to reduce both the demand and supply if treatment and recovery programs are going to work. To win this fight across the country, I believe we need a multi-faceted strategy that: Prevents drug abuse and addiction before it begins: Drug abuse and addiction prevention efforts must start in childhood. That begins with dedicated parents, strong communities and local education. The private sector must also be committed to joining this fight to achieve success, including coalitions driven by local communities and involving health, local law enforcement and social services professionals. When I was governor of Florida, my wife Columba took a very active role in prevention efforts with children; treatment facilities focusing on women with children and struggling children; and coordination of a resource network for local communities at the county level. Strengthens criminal justice: I will ensure federal law enforcement agencies have the resources they need, support policies that distinguish pill mills from evidence-based pain clinics, and broaden access to drug courts, an alternative to the traditional punishment system so that nonviolent drug offenders obtain treatment and recovery support. I will also enact smarter sentencing laws for drug offenders, with stiff consequences for drug lords, cartels and violent drug traffickers, while ensuring nonviolent drug offenders obtain the necessary treatment and more quickly return to their communities with reduced mandatory sentences. Secures the border to stop the flow of illicit drugs: I will secure the border to stop the flow of illicit drugs into the United States, given that most heroin enters the United States from Mexico. I will work with partner nations, such as Mexico, Colombia and Afghanistan, to address the source of illicit drugs and interdict illicit drug trafficking. Improves drug abuse treatment and recovery programs: I will strengthen and coordinate Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) to monitor and analyze electronic prescribing and dispensing data. I will promote innovation for a suite of treatment and recovery tools that align with individuals’ unique medical needs and beliefs. And I will conduct a rigorous evaluation of existing prevention, treatment and recovery programs to ensure funding supports evidence-based programs that consistently monitor results. Drug abuse and addiction hurts Americans from all walks of life. It is a complex problem that requires a multi-disciplinary, multi-faceted solution. It will take real leadership that makes solving the problem a top priority. I’ve successfully fought this epidemic as a Governor, but more importantly, I’ve experienced it as a father. We know how to make a difference in this fight, and with the right leadership and solutions, we will.	Addressing the Heartbreak of Addiction	partially false
3fb9f568	Opinion: Pandemics and freedom — finding balance As a state representative, I have had a front-row seat for Missouri’s response to the coronavirus threat. We made significant preparations to cope with the influx of patients and said our prayers that social distancing and the shelter in place orders would “flatten the curve” sufficiently to save lives and save us from the worst-case scenario nightmare predictions of millions dead nationwide. It has been greatly encouraging to hear from our governor and public health officials on a daily basis that we have mobilized vast resources, provided millions of dollars for equipment that our health care providers and first responders need to keep them safe while they tend to our sick, cut through red tape to make sure that intended recipients get what they should in record time, made sure that our food supply is safe, and have taken common-sense precautions to keep the “curve” as flat as a molehill when compared to the mountains experienced in other countries. Thankfully, we have seen success to date, as nearly half of our counties have not reported positive cases. It is also gratifying to see the private and nonprofit sectors do what they always do — help in as many ways as possible as quickly as possible to help those in need, starting with distributing food and assisting businesses with the application process to access government resources without further delay. The U.S. has never shut its economy down before on such a scale on purpose. We are in uncharted waters, and it has been gratifying to see how many Americans have risen to the challenge selflessly, starting with our health care workers and first responders, our schools, and our businesses that are enduring hardships unimaginable six months ago. On the other hand, I have seen the worst, starting with the morons in neighboring states who stockpiled hand sanitizers to sell at radically marked up prices online, raids on toilet paper based on some manner of wisdom that has so far escaped me, and the most galling of all, panic selling by allegedly intelligent financial wizards who manage to detonate trillions of dollars in market value on a daily basis because their quarterly numbers are not going so well — despite the undisputed knowledge that “this too shall pass.” If this lunacy continues, our retirement accounts will need another 10 years of contributions before we can comfortably leave the workforce. I have also spent more time than I would like knocking down nasty rumors that would only make a bad situation worse and plowing through red tape and Catch-22s that have still managed to survive. Another troubling development: We have been inundated with breathless, non-stop reporting about the numbers who have contracted the virus and those who have died here and worldwide, dutifully updated faster than the financial news updates stock prices. On the other side of that equation, context is sorely lacking: Nowhere near equal time has been given to the stories of those who have contracted the virus and lived through it, which is in fact the vast majority of those who have been sickened. We have had celebrities sickened by the virus — Tom Hanks and Boris Johnson come to mind immediately. Both survived and are on the mend. The folks in the mass media have been inexplicably restrained about dispensing hope by sharing the good news that the U.S. has a remarkably low death rate per thousand of confirmed cases — which is even less than advertised since there are probably millions among us who have had the virus, thought it was something else, and came through unharmed. I will not hold my breath that the mass media will change its tactics any time soon. As a state representative, I also have to think ahead to the lessons to be learned from this pandemic and how to best apply them at both the policy and appropriations levels. These are a few of the items I am contemplating at the moment. First, how do we — if possible — stop or severely curtail the damage to our people physically and economically as a result of viruses that sweep the globe with alarming regularity? Since China appears to be the world’s leading petri dish for brewing viruses that kill animals as well as humans and reportedly facilitates the jump of viruses from animals to humans through the ingestion of such critters as bats and pangolins available through so-called “wet markets,” do we need to permanently medically screen all travelers from China before we allow them to disembark from planes or ships when we know that this virus has as long as a two-week fuse? We wait in long lines at airports now for the TSA to make sure that all of us are not terrorists. The coronavirus has killed a lot more people than terrorists and shaved trillions off our economy, damage that terrorists can only dream of. For added context, anyone who believes that China is our “friend” has ignored that it is a totalitarian state that has lied through its collectivist teeth about the origins of this virus and fanned on the opportunity to contain it locally in Wuhan, has “relocated” at least 1 million Uighurs into “re-education” camps to cure them of their religious beliefs, has engaged in industrial espionage (and outright intellectual property theft) on a scale never seen before in human history, has invested trillions in infrastructure to control the economic destiny of Asia, all while instituting a “social credit system” designed to enforce domestic “conformity” of more than 1 billion people using Orwellian facial recognition technology to do so (or else). Khruschev told the West he would “bury” us and took off his shoe and banged it on a table at the U.N. to get our attention; China’s President for Life, i.e., Dictator, Xi, has spared us the histrionics and has instead put our trade deficit money to work to bury us quietly, slowly and surely. Before the dawn of the 20th century, American policy going back to John Hay’s Open Door Notes nearly 125 years ago was predicated on the notion that Chinese consumers would purchase American products in vast quantities and make us rich as a result. The exact opposite has happened. Missouri alone now imports more than $4 billion in goods from China. That represents 20 percent of all the imports in Missouri. China, in turn, buys $700 million of our goods, for a trade deficit in Missouri alone of more than $3.2 billion. We have seen the folly of chasing after the lowest possible price over the last 30 years: The result has been the hollowing out of our manufacturing sector, which devastated the Midwest. We have plenty of empty buildings to show you in Hannibal that are monuments to short-sighted trade policies that gave away our manufacturing birthright. Our farmers are also feeling the pain of the unpredictability of Chinese markets. At least 25 percent of Chinese hogs have been killed by the latest outbreak of swine flu — probably twice that, considering that China is not renowned for telling the truth about bad news (see coronavirus bald-faced lies above). Those hogs will take years to replace; meanwhile, the soybeans they consumed as feedstocks will not be headed to China any time soon. We literally cannot afford to wait for them to repopulate their swine herds. Charity begins at home. And so does sustained prosperity. Second, the damage to our economy due to supply chain interruptions from around the globe — primarily China and Japan, but also including Europe — must be examined. Just-in-time delivery is the cornerstone of lean manufacturing, but global disruptions such as this are yet another reminder that globalization is fine and dandy when it works, but craters national economies when it does not. We reroute commerce across Missouri and the Midwest when we are confronted with floods, but this is something different altogether — global supply chains rely on products that begin their transit oceans away, not from neighboring states. The more we make in America, the less we have to rely on products coming in from overseas. And will someone explain the rationale for outsourcing so much of our prescription drug production to China? What corporate geniuses decided that would be in our best interest as a nation? What happens when that supply chain “breaks,” or China decides to sell prescription meds to others? We should be smart enough to never find out that answer, starting today. Third: When will we start treating broadband internet as infrastructure, every bit as critical to our daily lives as roads, bridges, and electricity? Millions of Americans have been instructed to work from home as a result of this pandemic, and corporations will be evaluating the effectiveness of that approach to their bottom lines. Many of us anticipate that the expedient will become the norm since remote workers cut down on overhead expenses. Working remotely is fine and good if you have the internet capability to do so, but nearly 1 million Missourians in rural areas do not. The same goes for the expanded access to telemedicine announced at the federal level — great for those who have it, irrelevant for those who do not. Imagine how many fewer cases of the flu we would deal with on an annual basis if patients could be diagnosed and treated from home and not have to share their sickness with the general public in the first place. Millions of American students are being told to log on to their portals for online instruction while their schools are closed, but that is not an option for far too many of Missouri’s rural school students — an estimated 20,000 Missouri high school seniors alone this year have no such access at the most critical moment of the year: just before graduation. Virtual education is there in statute and with us in spirit, but does not happen for students who live outside of town. Finally, we have seen multiple excesses regarding the most routine of civil rights: a governor who has forbidden planting vegetables in family gardens and a mayor taking license plate numbers at drive-in church services like the FBI at a mob boss funeral are two of the most disturbing examples. If there is a “second round” of this virus in the fall and there is no vaccine available for all of us, we are going to have to make hard choices about how far is too far. Hopefully sooner rather than later, we will take a hard look at the lessons learned from how we handled our response to the coronavirus at the beginning of the 21st century’s “Roaring Twenties.” My prayer is that we all not only survive this pandemic but also find ways to take the sting out of the next inevitable wave of sickness that will wash over our shores in the coming months and years. Knowledge without application is useless. This is the ultimate teachable moment. We literally cannot afford to ignore it.

940bb348	SHARE By Mary Burke's support of the proposal to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour might make for good politicking in her campaign for governor, but her plan would be economically devastating to thousands of Wisconsin workers. Raising the minimum wage is a lose-lose proposition because it will result in significant Wisconsin job losses, will reduce economic opportunity for younger and lower-skilled workers, will raise consumer prices and will not meaningfully reduce poverty or help the working poor. A recent analysis by the Employment Policies Institute (EPI) found that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would kill as many as 27,937 jobs in Wisconsin. That estimate is consistent with a projection by the Congressional Budget Office that predicted 500,000 lost jobs nationwide if the federal minimum wage was increased to $10.10. So how would raising the minimum wage result in lost jobs? The answer is quite simple. Increasing the minimum wage will increase labor costs for employers. In turn, employers will respond by reducing their workforce, hiring fewer workers and reducing hours of work for existing employees. That translates into job loss and fewer economic opportunities for workers. WMC recently commissioned a statewide poll to test this issue and found 53% of likely voters initially support increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. However, voters quickly abandon the proposal when told of the projected job losses. Support plummets to 39% when voters know raising the minimum wage kills jobs. In order to understand who will be harmed most by a minimum wage increase, it is important to understand who minimum wage earners are. The data show those who stand to lose the most from a minimum wage increase are younger and lower-skilled workers. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 1.1% of workers over age 25 earn the minimum wage. That's because typical minimum wage earners in America are teenagers living with their parents in middle-class families. They are not living in poverty nor are they earning a wage that is responsible for sustaining a family. Wisconsin is no exception. According to the EPI analysis, the average household income of Wisconsin families impacted by raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour is $58,812. That's actually higher than Wisconsin's median household income of $52,627. Clearly, the majority of minimum wage earners are not the working poor, but are instead young people entering the workforce with little experience and very few skills. They are people who desperately need entry-level jobs to begin the process of climbing the economic ladder by acquiring skills that lead to better jobs with higher wages. Unfortunately, increasing the minimum wage places the bottom rung of the economic ladder out of reach for many of these workers by eliminating entry-level positions that help workers gain the experience needed to advance in the workforce. Those who advocate a minimum wage increase as a means to reduce poverty are on the wrong side of history. Increasing the minimum wage has proven to be an ineffective policy in terms of reducing poverty. The U.S. Census Bureau recently released a report that found 59.7% of working-age people in poverty do not work. It is difficult to imagine how increasing the minimum wage will help lift people out of poverty when roughly 60% of those in poverty aren't even working in the first place. The empirical evidence also suggests raising the minimum wage simply does not impact poverty levels. Between 2003 and 2007, a total of 28 states increased their minimum wage beyond the level of the federal minimum wage. A study done in 2010 by Joseph Sabia and Richard Burkhauser focused on the minimum wage and poverty found no evidence the minimum wage lowered poverty rates in any of those 28 states. Increasing the minimum wage is a poorly conceived economic policy that would cost Wisconsin thousands of jobs. It misplaces focus on the small sliver of the workforce (2.5%) who earn the minimum wage while simultaneously making it harder for entry-level workers to get ahead. Politicians should instead focus on how we can improve our state's business climate to attract and retain high-wage jobs such as those in our manufacturing sector. Scott Manley is vice president of government relations for Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce.	The latest coronavirus threat really hits below the belt. A new study claims the coronavirus can not only rob you of your taste and smell — it may leave men infertile and could be transmitted sexually. The study, published last month in JAMA, a monthly open-access medical journal published by the American Medical Association, found the presence of COVID-19 in 15% of semen samples collected. Researcher Dr. John Aitken likened it to the Zika virus. “It should be emphasized spermatozoa have a demonstrable capacity to carry viral infections from the male to the female reproductive tract, As happens during the sexual transmission of Zika, for example,” he told local San Antonio Fox 8. Zika virus is a mostly mosquito-borne virus that can also be sexually transmitted. The study also found that COVID-19 in human sperm “leads to a build-up of angiotensin II, which is a hormone that regulates kidney function and blood pressure. Increased levels of this hormone cause an immune response against the invading COVID-19 virus particles that increases the availability of reactive oxygen species that causes cell death… Prolonged exposure to elevated angiotenstin II levels can lead to cell death in sperm.” The study notes it could “ultimately result in a loss of male fertility.”	partially false
e5dc9784	The Sun is currently entering the solar minimum – a period of roughly 11 years when there is less activity on our host star. But experts who have been analysing the Sun believe there is evidence to suggest that it could last until 2055. The Sun follows 11 year cycles where it reaches a solar maximum and then a solar minimum. Are we in hot weather peak? Solar minimum could bring big freeze Space weather: NASA predicts next solar maximum will peak on THIS date During a solar maximum, the Sun gives off more heat and is littered with sunspots. Less heat in a solar minimum is due to a decrease in magnetic waves. However, there are occasions when a solar minimum or maximum can go on for more than one cycle. The most famous example of this is the Maunder minimum, which saw seven decades of freezing weather, began in 1645 and lasted through to 1715, and happened when sunspots were exceedingly rare. During this period, temperatures dropped globally by 1.3 degrees celsius leading to shorter seasons and ultimately food shortages in what was called a “mini Ice Age”.

3dcc5d7d	Today, Congressman Mike Rogers introduced HR 1813, the Border Wall Funding Act of 2017. This bill, which is supported and endorsed by FAIR, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, would impose a 2% fee on all remittances headed south of the US border. Remittances, or wire transfers, are commonly used by illegal immigrants to move money from the US to their home countries. In 2014, Mexico alone received over $24 billion in remittances sent from the US, while other South and Central American countries received over 15% of their GDPs in the form of remittances. “President Trump has made it very clear that he intends to complete a wall along our Southern border. As a senior member of the Homeland Security committee, I have long supported the border wall, which will protect Americans.” Rogers said. “In order to jumpstart the funding of the wall, I have introduced a bill to impose a 2% fee on remittances sent south of the border. This bill is simple – anyone who sends their money to countries that benefit from our porous borders and illegal immigration should be responsible for providing some of the funds needed to complete the wall. This bill keeps money in the American economy, and most importantly, it creates a funding stream to build the wall,” Rogers said. - ### -	Noa Pothoven: 'no question of euthanasia' says health minister after teen dies at home CORRECTED	partially false

beea9b95	By Truth In Sentencing Project, Press Release LISTEN to the Radio Ad here Lake Oswego, Or (July 19, 2012) – The Truth in Sentencing Project, a foundation dedicated to educating and informing Oregon’s citizens about the state’s criminal justice, prison systems and sentencing laws is releasing its first ad today. The ad is intended to let Oregonians know who is in prison and why they are there. • It addresses Oregon’s low incarceration rate, 33rd out of 50 states. Nearly 2/3rds of states have higher incarceration rates. The ad also calls into question Oregon’s high cost per day to incarcerate compared to other states such as Idaho. “There’s a lot of misinformation out there about Oregon’s sentencing laws and the criminal justice and prison systems and the Truth in Sentencing Project’s goal is to dispel those misconceptions,” said Steve Doell, Executive Director. For instance, many people believe that up to fifty percent of the prison population is incarcerated for possessing drugs. • In some states that may be true, however in Oregon less than one-half of one percent of Oregon’s 14,000 inmates is serving time for drug possession, and those were convicted for possession of substantial quantities of illegal drugs such as cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine, according to the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission (CJC). Also according to the CJC: • Less than 1 in 4 of all convicted felons receive prison sentences in Oregon. • About 7 in 10 of Oregon’s inmates are in prison for violent crimes and serious sex offenses including felony assault, armed robbery, kidnapping, manslaughter, child molestation, rape, attempted murder, and murder. • Seventeen percent are repeat property criminals, burglary, identity theft, fraud and car theft. Most of the rest are repeat drug criminals, almost all convicted of manufacturing and/or dealing substantial quantities of illegal drugs. One of the main reasons for the high percentage of violent criminals in Oregon prisons is because the voters passed Measure 11 in 1994. “The voters were tired of the high violent crime rate in Oregon and violent criminals receiving short sentences so they put a high priority on violent crimes,” Doell stated. “And while Oregon’s violent crime rate increased nearly 700% from 1960 until 1985, then basically plateaued through 1995, the violent crime rate has decreased more than 50% since then. We believe one of the most significant reasons for this decrease is Measure 11,” Doell added.

59c7030a	A Catholic school in Kentucky has condemned a group of its students after they were recorded harassing a Native American Vietnam veteran in a video that went viral on Saturday. The students, many of whom were wearing “Make America Great Again” caps, from private, all-male Covington Catholic High School in Park Hillswere in Washington for an anti-abortion rally on Friday when they were filmed surrounding Nathan Phillips and mocking the Native American’s singing and drumming. One teen in particular is seen standing in front of Phillips, staring into his face with a smile. Fellow students, many in hats and sweatshirts with President Donald Trump’s “MAGA” slogan, cheered him on and chanted, “build the wall, build the wall”, Phillips said. The footage was shared online by organizers of an indigenous peoples’ march that also took place on Friday. The video prompted a torrent of outrage online. Actress and activist Alyssa Milano tweeted that the footage “brought me to tears”, while actor Chris Evans tweeted that the students’ actions were “appalling” and “shameful”. In a joint statement, the high school and Diocese of Covington condemned the actions of the students “towards Nathan Phillips specifically, and Native Americans in general”. “We extend our deepest apologies to Mr. Phillips,” the statement read. “This behavior is opposed to the Church’s teachings on the dignity and respect of the human person.” “The matter is being investigated and we will take appropriate action, up to and including expulsion.” Covington Mayor Joe Meyer, a Democrat, said the “appalling” footage had rightly inspired “a tidal wave of condemnation” and that his town was now being linked with “intolerance and ethnic intimidation” because of the boys’ actions. “The videos being shared across the nation do NOT represent the core beliefs and values of this city,” he said in a statement. In a separate video uploaded to social media, the 64-year-old Phillips, an elder of Nebraska’s Omaha tribe, wiped away tears as he described the incident. “I heard them saying ‘build that wall, build that wall’. These are indigenous lands, we’re not supposed to have walls,” he said. “I wish I could see that energy of that young mass of young men, put that energy into making this country, really, really great, helping those that are hungry.” He told The Washington Post that while he was drumming, he thought about his wife, Shoshana, who died of bone marrow cancer nearly four years ago, and the threats that indigenous communities around the world are facing. “I felt like the spirit was talking through me,” Phillips said. Phillips holds an annual ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery to honor Native American veterans, according to media reports. He is a well-known Native American activist who was among those leading the Standing Rock protests in 2016-2017 against the construction of an oil pipeline in North Dakota. Democratic US Congresswoman Deb Haaland, a member of New Mexico’s Laguna Pueblo tribe, said on Twitter that Phillips had risked his life for his country, and that the students showed “blatant hate, disrespect, and intolerance”.

353ed1f7	The New York Times had no idea in 1984 that a piece taking a deep dive into the life of an upcoming billionaire would eventually resurface as confirmation of just how PERFECT a fit President Trump is for this time in America. We pulled out the highlights for you below but the entire article is incredible. Who could have predicted in 1984? Well, it seems that The New York Times described brilliant businessman Donald J. Trump as a great future President of the United States… THE EXPANDING EMPIRE OF DONALD TRUMP: ‘DONALD! HEY, DONALD! DONALD!’ The men were yelling, eager to call him by name. A storm front of cigar smoke was gathering above the hotel ballroom, packed elbow-to-elbow for a breakfast-hour sports forum with a crowd that included some of New York’s most wealthy, powerful and famous men. He has no public-relations agent. His competitors wonder how this can be, but watching him at the sports forum provided an explanation. While executives of the other teams told the audience about problems of negotiation and arbitration, about dirty restrooms inside their arenas and street crime outside and about ‘attempting to move the Mets in the right direction,’ “He said further that he would ‘continue to create chaos’ for the N.F.L. and, by the way, that he planned to build a domed stadium in New York.” Donald Trump was electrifying the room the rat-a-tat-tat revelations, dropping names of star N.F.L. players and coaches he would sign in a matter of hours. IT IS NOT YET 9 AM SPENDING A DAY WITH Donald Trump is like driving a Ferrari without the windshield. It’s exhilarating; he gets a few bugs in his teeth. Although he is still interested in such ideas as putting up the world’s tallest building on the East River, his mind wanders from the business of New York real estate. He has told people in the communications industry that he is ‘very interested in communications,’ which is like a 2,000-pound gorilla mentioning that he is very interested in becoming carnivorous. The Trump touch. It has set some people in New York to outright Trump worship; they call him ‘a real-estate genius’ who has helped lead the city out of the darkness of the mid-1970’s into a new era of glamour and excitement. Mr. Trump does not take exception to that. Many urban-affairs experts view the developers as saviors of our postindustrial cities. ‘With manufacturing leaving,’ says George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, ‘and with Federal and state aid diminishing, our cities desperately need the rich. Cities are tending to fall into two categories: cities of consumption and cities with no economic base.’ The rich of the world can live anywhere they want, explain the experts; Mr. Trump leads them to New York. Sales taxes, user taxes, jobs and resulting payroll taxes are generated. That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location, when every real-estate developer in the world would have done just about anything to get it, is testimony to Donald Trump’s persistence and to his skills as a negotiator. That he was able to put up a building of this dimension on this site demonstrates his finesse with the zoning code. ‘He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,’ a competitor says. He obtained the air rights over Tiffany, which allowed him to build a much higher building, and went to Equitable, which sold him the land for a 50 percent interest in the project. The day before he has sent $3,000 to an unfortunate family he has red about in the newspaper, something he does frequently, according to Mrs. Foerderer. For a billion-dollar corporation, there aren’t too many people around. Donald Trump makes or approves practically all decisions. He does not seem to write anything down, keeping volumes of company files as mental notes. Says Louise M. Sunshine, executive vice president: ‘If it is not the impossible, Donald is simply not interested. There has to be creativity. Money ceased to be the object a long time ago.’ Mr. Trump agrees with this assessment. ‘He is an almost unbelievable negotiator,’ says Irving Fischer of HRH Construction. ‘I don’t worship at the shrine of Donald Trump,’ he says, ‘but our company has given up trying to negotiate costs with him. We just say: ‘Tell us what you want, you’re going to get it anyway.’ ‘Trump can sense when people might want to get out of a project,’ says a developer… He trusts his instincts and has the guts to act on them.’ Roy M. Cohn, Mr. Trump’s friend and attorney, adds: ‘He has an uncanny sense of knowing that something is a good deal when it looks dismal to everyone else.’ Such was his first deal in Manhattan, his purchase of the Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street in the mid-1970’s, when even the Chrysler Building across the street was in foreclosure. Fred Trump described his son’s efforts to buy the hotel as ‘fighting for a seat on the Titanic.’ But, Donald Trump says, ‘I saw all those people coming out of Grand Central Terminal, and I said to myself, ‘How bad can this be?” He completely renovated the hotel, reopening it as the chrome-and-glass Grand Hyatt Hotel. He had moved in quietly, sending 14 different people to purchase 15 parcels of land and keeping his name out of it. ‘If the seller was Italian,’ says Mr. Trump, ‘we sent an Italian’ – something he probably did not learn at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, where he received a B.A. in economics in 1968. He bought and sold a few pieces of real estate in Philadelphia when he was bored with classes. ‘It’s in his genes,’ says Fred Trump, explaining his son’s success in real estate and recalling his three sons growing up on construction sites and in rental offices. ‘Donald Trump is the Michael Jackson of real estate,’ says Mr. Fischer. ‘We’ve been dealing with him since he was 16. He was an old trouper at age 25.’ His success also derives from his marketing skills. ‘I want to bring a little showmanship to real estate,’ Mr. Trumps says. He is often compared to the late William Zeckendorf, the renowned New York builder, who was said to owe much of his success to his personal flair. Other New York developers – including the Lefraks, the Rudins, the Tishmans, the Fishers, the Roses – go quietly about building more buildings than does Donal Trump, making their millions and keeping their names out of things. Some developers find Mr. Trump’s high-profile approach disagreeable, but most concede that it has worked for him. Preston Robert Tisch, a developer and chief operating officer of the Loews Corporation, who lost out to Mr. Trump in the battle over whose site would be chosen for the city’s convention center, concludes: ‘He captured the imagination of people to a greater degree than I could.’ The condominiums in Trump Tower are selling rapidly at what many believe are exorbitant prices, while less costly units in Museum Tower, for example, another ‘super luxury’ building a few blocks away, are not. According to a marketing study of four such buildings made by the rudential Insurance Company of America, Donald Trump seems to be the only person in New York who knows how to market superluxury apartments. How do you sell a one-bedroom apartment costin as much as a line item in the Department of Defense budget? ‘You sell them a fantasy,’ Mr. Trump explains. ‘He deserves full credit for his success,’ says another builder. ‘He spent $1 million on the waterfall in Trump Tower. No one else would have done that. If the building fails everyone will say: ‘Well sure, what jackass spends a million bucks on a waterfall?” ‘What sets Trump apart,’ says Ben V. Lambert, a real-estate investment banker, ‘is his ability to pierce through the canvas and get things done.He gets projects literally off the ground while others are having meetings and doing feasibility studies. But his real skill is putting together complex pieces of the puzzles: fiancing, zoning, parcels of land and such. This ethereal part of building is perhaps more important than the brick and mortar.’ ‘You don’t use the term ‘settlement’ with Donald.’ Mr. Trump does not place patience on his list of virtues. Workmen confirm a story that he paid $75,000 to truck several 40-foot trees from Florida to Trump Tower, where a tunnel was built into the building so the trees would not be damaged by frost. The 3,000-pound trees were then installed in the lower plaza of the atrium. Mr. Trump did not like the look. He ordered the trees removed, and, when workmen balked for 24 hours, Mr. Trump had the trees cut down with a chainsaw. He speaks slowly and softly and in the same casual manner to eminent architects an business moguls as to the coffee and sandwich vendor outside his casino-hotel. He is said, by acquaintances, to be generally even tempered and rarely seems ruffled. He is not given to unkind remarks and is nearly always in a positive frame of mind. I never think of the negative, he says. All obstacles can be overcome. He talks boastfully about his projects, but is uncomfortable talking about himself. He does not smoke and does not drink alcohol. He plays golf and tennis regularly. His wife describes him as an all-American boy who likes country music best and prefers a steak and baked potato to anything called cuisine. His father pulled Donald Trump out of a prep school because he didn’t want his son growing up with spoiled kids with $40 ball gloves, sending him instead to military school. His father bragged at the sports forum that he had taken the subway and saved $15 car fare. Mr. Trump seems to have maintained a detached view of his flood of fortune and publicity. He frequently mentions that all of the attention and success may well be fleeting. His friends say that he is not yet fully cognizant of his station. He loves to got to ’21’ for lunch and be impressed with all the wealthy, powerful, famous people, says an acquaintance. He doesn’t quite realize that he’s one of them. After dusk, he rides through the city on his way to the last appointment of the day, enjoying the lights that make the whole city sparkle like the inside of Trump Tower. He talked about his plans for the future, as much as anyone who operates on spontaneous combustion can. Asked to explain, he adds: What does it all mean when some wacko over in Syria can end the world with nuclear weapons? He says that his concern for nuclear holocaust is not one that popped into his mind during any recent made-of-television movie. He says that it has been troubling him since his uncle, a nuclear physicist, began talking to him about it 15 years ago. His greatest dream is to personally do something about the problem and, characteristically, Donald Trump thinks he has an answer to nuclear armament: Let him negotiate arms agreements – he who can talk people into selling $100 million properties to him for $13 million. Negotiations is an art, he says and I have a gift for it. The idea that he would ever be allowed to got into a room alone and negotiate for the United States, let alone be successful in disarming the world, seems the naive musing of an optimistic, deluded young man who has never lost at anything he has tried. But he believes that through years of making his views known and through supporting candidaes who share his views, it could someday happen. He is constantly asked about his interest in running for elective office. Absolutely not, he answers. All of the false smiles and the red tape. It is too difficult to really do anything. He dislikes meetings and paperwork and is in the enviable position of being able to avoid both.

16ce44aa	Republican State Senator and candidate for governor, Michael Williams, announced his opposition to regulating or banning bump stocks. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms determined in a 2015 memo that bump stocks are not mechanical, therefore they do not fall under the machine gun weapons ban of 1986. An attack on bump stocks is an attack on the Second Amendment. In solidarity with gun owners across the nation, Michael Williams is giving away a free bump stock to one lucky winner. Williams said, “The tragedy in Las Vegas broke my heart, but any talk of banning or regulating bump stocks is merely cheap political lip service from career politicians. In reality, the bump stock is the new, shiny object politicians are using to deceive voters into believing they are taking action against gun violence. Many firearms experts determined the Las Vegas shooter’s use of a bump stock actually prevented more casualties and injures due to its inconsistency, inaccuracy, and lack of control. There is zero evidence that banning bump stocks would prevent any gun violence deaths. Georgia’s gun owners deserve a governor who will stand with them when liberals and Hollywood elites attack our fundamental rights. That’s why I am standing for the second amendment and giving away a bump stock as a show of support.” “If politicians wanted to have a real conversation on reducing gun violence, they would be discussing mental health awareness, and ways to reduce the weekly bloodbath in Chicago and other inner cities. You cannot regulate evil out of existence. Blaming guns or bump stocks for the actions of a lunatic, is the same as blaming McDonald’s for heart disease,” continued Williams. “I will stand up for the Second Amendment against liberals and weak Republicans who wish to limit our freedoms. Not only that, I will continue to call out Democrats and Republicans who provide cheap talk and excuses rather than solutions.” ### BUMP STOCK GIVEAWAY LINK https://williamsgeorgia.com/bump-stock-giveaway/	These gender-neutral schools want to crush stereotypes	false

6378a0ff	A coalition of civil society groups has described the proposed Control of Infectious Diseases Bill as a threat to human rights. The group, 41 in total, said the House of Representatives must subject the bill to public scrutiny by embarking on stakeholders’ consultations and a public hearing to harness public inputs into the legislation. Many Nigerians had criticised a move by the House of Representatives to repeal the Quarantine Act and replace it with the Control of Infectious Diseases Bill. The bill, which scaled second reading before it was stood down last week, has 82 sections. Sponsored by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, the bill seeks to strengthen the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and make it more proactive and “not just reactive and function when there is an outbreak.” The bill seeks to empower the president, the minister of health as well as the director-general of NCDC, and the institutions they head, to make regulations on quarantining, vaccination and prevention of infectious diseases in Nigeria. CSOs position In a statement issued on Tuesday, the groups said the bill empowers NCDC to restrict fundamental rights and freedoms of the people. “The Bill empowers the NCDC to restrict fundamental rights and freedoms at will, and abuse constitutionally established institutions and processes, without any form of accountability. “For instance, Section 10 (3) gives the Director-General express powers to use force to enter any premises without a warrant,” it said. The group also said the bill violates key principles of legislative drafting rules mandating laws to be simple, clear and unambiguous. It, therefore, demanded the immediate review of all provisions of the bill. “The Bill violates key principles of legislative drafting rules mandating laws to be simple, clear and unambiguous. “This leaves room for significant amount of discretion on the part of the implementing authorities and limits the rights of citizens and respective institutions to question decisions taken in the exercise of the powers provided in the Bill. “We demand a review of all provisions of the Bill that foster inter-agency conflicts and abuse of power and undermine constitutionally guaranteed rights and are contrary to the rule of law and Nigeria’s international human rights obligations.” The groups include: Girl Child Africa, Center For Liberty, Centre for Democracy and Development, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, Say No Campaign, Amnesty International, YIAGA Africa, Human and Environmental Development Agenda, Global Rights and African Centre for Media and Information Literacy. Others are International Press Centre, Lawyers Alert, Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre, Enough is Enough, Community Life Project, Centre for Information Technology and Development, Centre for Impact Advocacy, Concerned Nigerians, Lex Community NG, Education as a Vaccine, Dinidari Foundation, Albino Foundation, The Community of PWDs in Nigeria, Dorothy Njemanze Foundation, Tap Nitiative for citizens development, Raising New Voices Initiative, Haly Hope Foundation, Youths Concerns Development Foundation, Adopt A Goal For Development Initiative, Coalition in Defence of Nigerian Democracy and Constitution, PITCH Nigeria, House of Justice, Molluma Medico-Legal Centre, Albino Foundation, The Community of PWDs in Nigeria, Alliances for Africa, Youths in Motion, Persons with Disabilities Action Network, Silverchip Fox, Community Action for Popular Participation and Resource Centre for Human Rights & Civic Education. Allegations On Tuesday, Mr Gbajabiamila said the allegation that the bill is a sinister attempt to turn Nigerians into guinea pigs for medical research while taking away their fundamental human rights was far from the truth. He said as representatives of the Nigerian people, members of the House would never contemplate doing anything that would jeopardise the wellbeing of the citizens. ADVERTISEMENT He promised that a public hearing would be conducted during the consideration of the bill.		true
6bb4fea4	Thank you to Universities UK UUK for hosting us today. In my first speech on universities a month ago, I addressed the subject of international education. I am proud of the sector’s international standing and reputation around the world. Today, I want to reflect further on what underpins this excellence, and what more we can do to enhance it. At the root of that success is the autonomy and academic freedom that enables us to attract brilliant people to work in and run our universities and lead our sectoral bodies. I’d like to congratulate Nicola Dandridge for her recent CBE and thank outgoing UUK President, Chris Snowden, for his excellent service. I would also like to congratulate Dame Julia Goodfellow on taking over the UUK Presidency – the first woman to hold the post ever, I believe in around 100 years of the existence of UUK and its predecessor body. Success of the sector The higher education sector can be proud of its success over the last 5 years and I want to pay tribute to my colleagues David Willetts and Greg Clark for their part in the reforms that have helped sustain the high esteem in which it is held around the world. We have seen: a transformed financial situation; as the OECD says, we are one of the only countries in the world to have found a way of sustainably funding higher education we have seen record numbers of young people entering higher education, including record numbers from disadvantaged backgrounds and we have seen record numbers of graduates in work; the recent Graduate Labour Market statistics showed the highest employment rate for working age graduates since 2007 at 87.5% through all this, the UK has retained its place as a world leader in HE , with 4 universities in the global top 10, and as number one in the world for the impact of our research Unfinished business It’s a great success story, but there is unfinished business and, in the coming months, my focus will be on implementing 3 key manifesto pledges, so that we consolidate and build on these achievements: firstly, lifting the cap on student numbers and widening participation, so that we remove barriers to ambition and meet the PM’s commitment to double the proportion of disadvantaged young people entering higher education by 2020 from 2009 levels secondly, delivering a teaching excellence framework that creates incentives for universities to devote as much attention to the quality of teaching as fee-paying students and prospective employers have a right to expect thirdly, driving value for money both for students investing in their education, and taxpayers underwriting the system, so that we ensure the continuing success and stability of these reforms Taking these points in reverse order. Meeting value for money expectations Around now, the first cohort of students to enter under the 2012 reforms is preparing to enter the labour market. They have been working hard for their final exams and made a significant investment in higher education. They are looking critically at what they get for that investment, and so must we, as a government, on behalf of taxpayers. I am concerned that recent surveys – the HEPI-HEA Student Academic Experience Survey, as well as a BBC/ComRes poll – showed that only around half of students felt their course had provided good value for money. All of us need to reflect on this and on what we can do to address such unease. More informed choices Thanks to the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act passed in March, we can now start to assess the employment and earnings returns to education by matching Department for Business, Innovation and Skills BIS and Department for Education DfE education data with HMRC employment and income data and Department for Work and Pensions DWP benefits data. Information of this sort will be incredibly useful for young people choosing courses or jobs that are most suitable for them. It will also enable education providers to assess their effectiveness in delivering positive labour market outcomes for their students. I am also pleased to see the piloting of new National Student Survey questions that measure the engagement of students with their course, staff and fellow students. This was shown in the US to be a good proxy for the value add of a university in terms of ‘learning gain’ - the improvement in knowledge, skills and work-readiness that students demonstrate over time. While independent learning is vital, universities must get used to providing clearer information about how many hours students will spend in lectures, seminars and tutorials, and who will deliver the teaching. Indeed the Competition and Markets Authority have advised higher education providers that information should be available to prospective students to meet the requirements of consumer law. I know this is already on the sector’s agenda. I will continue to push for more data to be made available, including for alternative providers. A Higher Education Policy Institute Hepi survey suggests as many as three-quarters of undergraduates want more information about where their fees go – and I sympathise with that. Such transparency looks to me like an essential way of addressing value for money concerns. More competition More competition will also be central to our efforts to drive up standards. In the last 3 years, we have seen more universities created than at any time since the 1992 expansion. We are committed to promoting high quality market entry, whilst at the same time ensuring a regulatory regime which guards against poor quality provision. More competition and more informed choice will help drive up value for money for both students and taxpayers. Graduate premium The graduate earnings premium is an important measure of the value universities add and of the greater productivity of those with skills acquired in higher education. Of course, many graduates will consciously choose to go into occupations that do not maximise their incomes – we must remember that education is about more than just wage returns. Indeed, that is the reason we have a progressive repayment system for student loans. But it is also important to remember that higher lifetime graduate earnings provide benefits to society – including higher tax revenues and faster and fuller repayment of student loans. Evidence of a decline in the graduate earnings premium is therefore a concern as we look to drive up productivity in the economy, secure our public finances and ensure our higher education system continues to be funded in a sustainable way. Between 2006 and 2015, the graduate earnings premium decreased from around 55% higher to around 45% higher than the earnings of non-graduates, with graduates now earning on average £31k and non-graduates £22,000. There is still a considerable benefit – but we cannot be complacent and must analyse why the premium employers pay for graduates is falling at a time when graduate-level skills are in growing demand. Course choice and curriculum design An important part of the answer is that we are not yet rising to the challenge of ensuring that enough young people are choosing courses where there are skills shortages and strong employer demand – notably in science, technology, engineering and mathematics STEM . Nor are we doing enough to ensure that all students emerge from university prepared for work. Last year’s CBI /Pearson Education and Skills survey suggested that 47% of employers felt universities should do more to help students become job-ready. Government, business and the university sector need to come together to address this mismatch between supply and demand in the graduate labour market. Businesses should not just be seen as customers of universities, recruiting the graduates they educate or buying research expertise, but as active partners. Universities need to develop business-outreach into a core function that has influence over curriculum design. Closer partnership between universities and business will help us tackle the misguided view that ‘more means worse’ and ensure that the investment both students and taxpayers make in higher education provides visible returns. Teaching Excellence Framework TEF Above all, to meet students’ high expectations of their university years and to deliver the skills our economy needs, we need a renewed focus on teaching. This is vital unfinished business from the reforms of the last Parliament. As David Willetts himself acknowledged in a recent interview with the Times Higher Education; “teaching has been by far the weakest aspect of English higher education”. This must change. There must be recognition of excellent teaching – and clear incentives to make ‘good’ teaching even better. Some rebalancing of the pull between teaching and research is undoubtedly required. It is striking that while we have a set of measures to reward high quality research, backed by substantial funding the Research Excellence Framework, there is nothing equivalent to drive up standards in teaching. That is why my priority as Universities Minister will be to make sure students get the teaching they deserve and employers get graduates with the skills they need by introducing the Teaching Excellence Framework we promised in our manifesto. Aims for the TEF My aims for the TEF are: to ensure all students receive an excellent teaching experience that encourages original thinking, drives up engagement and prepares them for the world of work to build a culture where teaching has equal status with research, with great teachers enjoying the same professional recognition and opportunities for career and pay progression as great researchers to stimulate a diverse HE market and provide students with the information they need to judge teaching quality – in the same way they can already compare a faculty’s research rating market and provide students with the information they need to judge teaching quality – in the same way they can already compare a faculty’s research rating to recognise those institutions that do the most to welcome students from a range of backgrounds and support their retention and progression to further study or a graduate job I expect the TEF to include a clear set of outcome-focused criteria and metrics. This should be underpinned by an external assessment process undertaken by an independent quality body from within the existing landscape. Believe me, I have no intention of replicating the individual and institutional burdens of the REF . I am clear that any external review must be proportionate and light touch, not big, bossy and bureaucratic. I want to work with you all, as well as with the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the Quality Assurance Agency, to design a framework that has widespread support and works for the sector, as well as students and employers and taxpayers. This is not happening in isolation. It goes with the grain of our reforms since 2010 and aims to accelerate positive changes already underway in the sector. We will be consulting widely and I am not pre-empting what any of the incentives might look like. I am keen to hear your views ahead of a green paper, which the Department of Business, Innovation and SkiIls plans to publish in the autumn. Maintaining the value of our degrees One of the things I want to focus on in the green paper is how the TEF can help improve the information that matters most for graduates and employers: the degree classification. Here we face a significant challenge. The UK’s standard model of classes of honours is on its own no longer capable of providing the recognition hardworking students deserve and the information employers require. Students across the country have just finished their exams and are looking for good graduate jobs. Last week’s High Fliers survey reminded us that the class of 2015 is more career-oriented than ever before. They rightly want hard work at university to be recognised and for their degree to be a currency that carries prestige and holds its value. At the same time, businesses need a degree classification system that will help them identify the best applicants for their firms. I know the sector is starting to tackle this need for richer information through the Higher Education Achievement Report and this is a valuable development, but this work needs greater urgency. Let me explain why: There has been a significant increase in the proportion of people receiving firsts and 2:1 degrees. To the extent this expansion in the number of firsts and 2:1s is to do with rising levels of attainment and hard work, I applaud it. But I suspect I am not alone in worrying that less benign forces are at work with the potential to damage the UK higher education brand. On the face of it, the facts are certainly startling. There has been a 300% increase in the percentage of firsts since the 1990s. Over 70% of graduates now get a First or 2:1 – up by 7 percentage points in the past 5 years. And compared to just 47% in the mid-1990s. In 2013 to 14, over 50% of students were awarded an upper second, suggesting that this grade band not only disguises considerable variation in attainment, but also permits some to coast. The Higher Education Academy found that nearly half of institutions had changed their degree algorithms to; “ensure that their students were not disadvantaged compared to those in other institutions”. The Teaching Excellence Framework we will introduce will include incentives for the sector to tackle degree inflation and ensure that hard-won qualifications hold their value. I want the green paper to look at the role that external examiners play in underpinning standards and ensuring our grading system provides a clearer, more comparable picture of student attainment. Stronger student engagement I also want to make sure that the Teaching Excellence Framework encourages universities to adopt a grading system that does more to motivate and engage students throughout their course. The familiar pattern of a First, 2:1 and 2:2, Third is widely recognised. But providing extra granularity through a grade point average GPA – a 13 point scale developed by the sector – will encourage consistent effort, make it less easy to coast within the 2:1 band and give employers more information about candidates within that classification. It is vital that we continue to drive up student engagement. Students are working harder than before and that is a welcome trend, which we want to support through the Teaching Excellence Framework. But many full time students are still not being sufficiently stretched. In the most recent Student Academic Experience Survey, the total weekly workload reported by students averages 30.5 hours, including 14 hours of independent study, and varies greatly by subject. The reported weekly workload on courses such as Mass Communications and Documentation is as little as 22 hours. Students are telling us in surveys that they know they would do better by investing more time in their studies. As a more finely-calibrated long-run batting average, GPA should drive greater student engagement than our present system, which, notwithstanding more summative coursework, in many ways can still look like a snapshot performance measure. I know Sir Robert Burgess, chair of the Grade Point Average Advisory Group, has predicted all UK universities will adopt the model by the end of the decade. I support this goal and want the green paper to examine how the new Teaching Excellence Framework can encourage universities to adopt dual running of the GPA and honours degree system, as recommended in the recent Higher Education Academy report. Widening participation My focus has of course been on students and the job market. But this does not mean we overlook the value of learning for its own sake, or the role of higher education in social mobility. The 2012 reforms mean that anyone with the ability can now make going to university their goal, a fact underscored by our decision to lift the cap on student numbers altogether from this academic year. Anyone with potential to benefit from university should not be prevented from going because of their background or ability to pay. But of course there is still more to do. The Prime Minister has set an ambitious goal to double the proportion of those from disadvantaged backgrounds progressing into higher education by 2020 compared with 2009. I will challenge you to do all you can to reach this target. That’s why I am delighted that Professor Les Ebdon has agreed to extend his term as director of the Office of Fair Access to help us fulfil a commitment that is central to this One Nation Government’s aim to promote social mobility in this country. In particular, I want to see more progress being made in the most selective institutions. Data from UCAS shows the clear progress that the sector has made, and I applaud that. I want to see more outreach and more innovation in terms of course length and design. Degree Apprenticeships and 2-year courses in particular offer a more accessible route to a higher education and a faster path to productive employment. We also need to match our efforts on driving up fair access by also ensuring those young people succeed in getting a good qualification and have an opportunity to find a fulfilling career. I know that this ‘whole student lifecycle’ approach is one that you are taking seriously – and it is embedded in the National Strategy for Access and Student Success. I expect our new Teaching Excellence Framework to include incentives that reward institutions who do best at retention and progression of disadvantaged students through their college years. Conclusion I recognise that this is a challenging agenda and that you are already focused on many of these issues. We will be working with closely with universities and with the grain of reforms that have put power and choice in the hands of students. Those institutions that can demonstrate that they excel in teaching and in supporting all students – including those from disadvantaged backgrounds – through university into graduate jobs will reap rewards. If we can get this right – on driving value for money for students and taxpayers on creating incentives to encourage excellent teaching and on widening participation – then I’m confident we can together make a world-leading higher education sector greater still.

When Donald Trump proposed in 2015 that we place a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, it was at a time when Europe was experiencing historical levels of migrations and terrorism. ISIS was carrying out terrorist attacks weekly and hundreds of innocent people were getting killed. Whether it was a jihadi running over 85 people with a truck, the Paris bombings, or even the German priest that was beheaded for being a Christian–they all were fueled by Islam. People need to understand that Islam is very dangerous and contradicts everything we believe in the United States. A Georgia state legislator has introduced legislation that would ban burqas and traditional Muslim veils. State Rep. Jason Spencer (R) filed legislation on Wednesday that would prevent women from posing for driver’s license photos while wearing a veil. The measure also adds burqas to a law that makes it a misdemeanor to wear a face covering in public or while driving. Spencer argues that this bill is specifically intended to reduce fear about Islamic terrorism. Spencer’s bill would prevent women from wearing head coverings while driving or while walking down a public sidewalk. “This bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us,” Spencer told WSB-TV in Atlanta. Many people will immediately read this and argue that the First Amendment allows for protection of religious freedoms, and that is a true and correct argument. Our Constitution does allow all citizens to practice whatever religion they choose. Here is the problem: Islam is not a religion. It is a cancerous disease that calls for all Christians, women, and homosexuals to be brutally murdered for the false god Allah. A vast majority of terrorist attacks are carried out in the name of Allah. When was the last time we experienced a terrorist attack from someone citing the Bible? Quran 8:12: I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them. Quran 9:29: Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. Quran 3:151: Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority. Is that what we want to blossom in our country, schools, and communities? Just for starters, Liberals already banned school prayer because Christian values may offend someone–so how is this any different? There is a difference between a hijab and burqa. Spencer is arguing that we should ban the full-on cover that cloaks women from head to toe. While Liberals will decry this action, they better accept it because it will have a snowball effect in the United States. Outside of Georgia, several other states are starting to propose similar legislation. The threat of Islam and those that practice it are so severe that France and Belgium have banned burqas and similar coverings altogether to try and keep citizens safe. Local governments in Italy, Spain, and Switzerland have also instituted bans. This move is about keeping the American people safe. Under President Trump, we will do whatever is necessary to keep the American people safe.

a9994f18	A South African pastor, Alfred Ndlovu has died of malnutrition after going without food for 30 days when he tried to emulate Jesus Christ and fast for 40 days and 40 nights. Buzz South Africa reports that the 44-year-old pastor left home on June 17 for a nearby bush to have prayers, just like Jesus did. Attempting to equal or break Jesus Christ record of fasting for 40 days, Mr Alfred Ndlovu died just a month despite having no history of illness. He was alone in the wilderness and his body was found by a stranger who then called the police. He was known by his family and community at large as a very spiritual person whose faith could move mountains and his death surprised everyone, even church members. One close relative said: ‘He was a very spiritual man. It’s unfortunate he had to die this way. After a month we got the sad news of his death. The pastor was a healthy and religious old man who did not even look his age.	Joy Covey: Amazon pioneer and high tech rock star dead at 50 in Woodside bike crash	other
0765375b	(Natural News) For more than 60 years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has known that the changes occurring to planetary weather patterns are completely natural and normal. But the space agency, for whatever reason, has chosen to let the man-made global warming hoax persist and spread, to the detriment of human freedom. It was the year 1958, to be precise, when NASA first observed that changes in the solar orbit of the earth, along with alterations to the earth’s axial tilt, are both responsible for what climate scientists today have dubbed as “warming” (or “cooling,” depending on their agenda). In no way, shape, or form are humans warming or cooling the planet by driving SUVs or eating beef, in other words. But NASA has thus far failed to set the record straight, and has instead chosen to sit silently back and watch as liberals freak out about the world supposedly ending in 12 years because of too much livestock, or too many plastic straws. In the year 2000, NASA did publish information on its Earth Observatory website about the Milankovitch Climate Theory, revealing that the planet is, in fact, changing due to extraneous factors that have absolutely nothing to do with human activity. But, again, this information has yet to go mainstream, some 19 years later, which is why deranged, climate-obsessed leftists have now begun to claim that we really only have 18 months left before the planet dies from an excess of carbon dioxide (CO2). The truth, however, is much more along the lines of what Serbian astrophysicist Milutin Milankovitch, after whom the Milankovitch Climate Theory is named, proposed about how the seasonal and latitudinal variations of solar radiation that hit the earth in different ways, and at different times, have the greatest impact on earth’s changing climate patterns. The below two images (by Robert Simmon, NASA GSFC) help to illustrate this, with the first showing earth at a nearly zero orbit, and the second showing earth at a 0.07 orbit. This orbital change is depicted by the eccentric, oval shape in the second image, which has been intentionally exaggerated for the purpose of showing the massive change in distance that occurs between the earth and the sun, depending on whether it is at perihelion or aphelion. “Even the maximum eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit – 0.07 – it would be impossible to show at the resolution of a web page,” notes the Hal Turner Radio Show. “Even so, at the current eccentricity of .017, the Earth is 5 million kilometers closer to Sun at perihelion than at aphelion.” For more related news about climate change and global warming from an independent, non-establishment perspective, be sure to check out ClimateScienceNews.com. The biggest factor affecting earth’s climate is the SUN As for earth’s obliquity, or its change in axial tilt, the below two images (Robert Simmon, NASA GSFC) show the degree to which the earth can shift on both its axis and its rotational orientation. At the higher tilts, earth’s seasons become much more extreme, while at lower tilts they become much more mild. A similar situation exists for earth’s rotational axis, which depending on which hemisphere is pointed at the sun during perihelion, can greatly impact the seasonal extremes between the two hemispheres. Based on these different variables, Milankovitch was able to come up with a comprehensive mathematical model that is able to compute surface temperatures on earth going way back in time, and the conclusion is simple: Earth’s climate has always been changing, and is in a constant state of flux due to no fault of our own as human beings. When Milankovitch first put forward his model, it went ignored for nearly half a century. Then, in 1976, a study published in the journal Science confirmed that Milankovitch’s theory is, in fact, accurate, and that it does correspond to various periods of climate change that have occurred throughout history. In 1982, six years after this study was published, the National Research Council of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences adopted Milankovitch’s theory as truth, declaring that: “… orbital variations remain the most thoroughly examined mechanism of climatic change on time scales of tens of thousands of years and are by far the clearest case of a direct effect of changing insolation on the lower atmosphere of Earth.” If we had to sum the whole thing up in one simple phrase, it would be this: The biggest factor influencing weather and climate patterns on earth is the sun, period. Depending on the earth’s position to the sun at any given time, climate conditions are going to vary dramatically, and even create drastic abnormalities that defy everything that humans thought they knew about how the earth worked. But rather than embrace this truth, today’s climate “scientists,” joined by leftist politicians and a complicit mainstream media, insist that not using reusable grocery bags at the supermarket and not having an electric vehicle are destroying the planet so quickly that we absolutely must implement global climate taxes as the solution. “The climate change debate is not about science. It is an effort to impose political and economic controls on the population by the elite,” wrote one commenter at the Hal Turner Radio Show. “And it’s another way to divide the population against itself, with some who believe in man-made global warming and some who don’t, i.e. divide and conquer.” You can read the full Hal Turner Radio Show report at this link.

cef0a3d1	"Occupation: President and CEO, Bettencourt Tax Advisors L.L.C. Legislative Experience: Senate Member: 2015 - present Party: Republican First elected to the Senate in 2014, Senator Paul Bettencourt represents Senate District 7, which encompasses most of West Harris County. He previously served 10 years, from 1998 - 2008, as the Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector, where he introduced “Smart Government” at the Harris County Tax Office and developed a customer service-driven organization. His team created the first major county online property tax payment system and the first county tax office website with online vehicle registration in Texas. (His motto was “Get on-line, not in-line.”) He was well-known as the “Tax Man” for his outspoken efforts to cut property taxes. In the most recent Legislative Session, Senator Bettencourt successfully passed Senate Bill 2, the Texas Property Tax Reform and Transparency Act of 2019, by a vote of 21-9 to bring meaningful property tax reform and relief to all Texas taxpayers. This was the first major property tax reform legislation in almost 40 years, and the culmination of two decades of advocacy. He also continued his work on adult stem cell therapies in Texas by sponsoring HB 3148, building upon previous legislative sessions to get government out of the way, allowing new therapies to flourish and give terminally and chronically ill patients hope for a better quality of life. His work during the 86th Session earned him the distinction of ""Senate MVP"" by Capitol Inside, ""Bull of the Brazos"" by Texas Monthly, the Legislative Legacy Award by Texas Public Policy Foundation and he was given the ""Citizen's Choice Award"" by Empower Texans. A champion for conservative solutions to Texas' challenges, Senator Bettencourt has built a strong reputation at the Capitol advocating for taxpayers. In his previous legislative sessions he worked tirelessly to pass conservative budgets, enact a supermajority requirement within a taxing jurisdiction to raise taxes, (which prevented a $100,000,000 tax increase in its first year) as well as author SB 7 which sought to stamp out the growing plague of inappropriate student-educator relationships. A compassionate conservative, Senator Bettencourt has been a leader on ""Right to Try"" and adult stem cell legislation, fighting for terminally and chronically ill patients across Texas to have better access to treatments and new therapies. Legislation that he sponsored on this important issue was adopted by the American Legislative Exchange Council as a national model other states could follow. He has also greatly expanded dual credit opportunities (SB 1004) for Texas students and Joint-Authored bipartisan legislation to enhance educational opportunities for students through ISD/Charter partnerships (SB 1882). Numerous organizations have acknowledged Senator Bettencourt for his work in the Texas Senate. In his first session, Capitol Inside named him ""Most Valuable Freshman"" and Vision America named him their ""Outstanding Texas Legislator."" He has also been named “Taxpayer Advocate of the Year” by the Americans for Prosperity, Previously as an elected official he was named a “Hero of Faith” by the Houston Area Pastors’ Council, and earned the “Pioneer Award” from the Harris County Republican Party. Senator Bettencourt is the Chair of the Senate Committee on Local Government and serves on the Senate Finance, Education, and Criminal Justice committees. He has also been named to the Redistricting Committee by Lt. Governor Patrick. He also served as the Chair of the Senate Republican Caucus from January 2016 to February 2021. A Bachelor of Science graduate of Texas A&M University in Industrial Distribution, Senator Bettencourt is the President and CEO of a tax consulting company in Houston that has grown to forty employees. He is also a radio and television personality. The Senator and his wife Susan are active members of Saint John Vianney Catholic Church, where Paul is a fourth degree Knight of Columbus. Senate District 7 is located in Harris County and includes Bunker Hill Village, Hedwig Village, parts of Houston, Hunters Creek Village, Jersey Village, Piney Point Village, Spring, and Tomball."	The CDC has admitted face masks do little to prevent the spread of COVID-19 amid mounting pressure to lift mask mandates across the U.S. In a new study, the CDC found face masks had a negligible impact on coronavirus numbers that didn’t exceed statistical margins of error. The study found that between March and December 2020, face mask orders reduced infection rates by 1.5 percent over the rolling periods of two months each. The masks were 0.5 percent effective in the first 20 days of the mandates and less than 2 percent effective after 100 days. The CDC added it still recommends wearing face masks, although it admitted such mandates do not make any statistical difference. In the meantime, some states across the nation have slowly returned to normalcy by putting an end to mask mandates. 	true

ADVERTISEMENT A USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll released Thursday evening shows Sanders leading with 44 percent to Clinton's 43 percent. Sanders's 1-point lead falls within the poll's margin of error. California's primary is open to independent voters that give Sanders a boost; among registered Democrats, Clinton still leads Sanders by 4 points, while Sanders has 50 percent support from independents to Clinton's 34 percent. But, the poll found, Clinton has a 10-point lead among those likely to vote next week, primarily due to support from older voters. Sanders has continued to close the gap between him and Clinton and has been campaigning hard across the state. “Bernie Sanders has tapped into a wellspring of support in the Democratic primary over the last several weeks and he’s closing with a rush,” said Dan Schnur, director of USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, which partnered with the L.A. Times to conduct the poll. ""If Clinton manages to hold him off and win the primary, it would be as a result of a low turnout that tilts the electorate in her direction."" Sanders has barnstormed California in recent weeks, hoping to grab a large share of the state's 475 pledged delegates up for grabs. However, if primary results are as close as recent polls indicate, Sanders and Clinton would split the 475 delegates evenly, which wouldn't give the Vermont senator much of a boost in his search for the nomination. Clinton leads Sanders in the pledged delegate count 1,769 to 1,501. When superdelegates, the unbound party leaders who vote at the July convention, are factored in, the former first lady's lead blossoms to 2,313 and puts her just 70 delegates short of the Democratic nomination, according to The Associated Press delegate tracker. Sanders has pledged to fight up until the Democratic National Convention to convince superdelegates to flip and hopes a convincing win in California will help. The Los Angeles Times poll is just the latest to show it will be a close race for the two Democratic candidates. A Field poll released Thursday morning showed Clinton leading Sanders by just 2 points, 45 percent to 43 percent, among likely Democratic primary voters. And a NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Wednesday similarly shows Clinton and Sanders within 2 points of each other: Clinton leads Sanders 49 percent to 47 percent in that poll. The LA Times poll surveyed 1,500 voters from May 19-31 and has a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points. That included 903 Democratic voters, with a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points, and 503 likely Democratic voters, with a margin of error of 5 points."

fad64e2f	Obama administration insists there was no quid pro quo, but critics charge payment amounted to ransom. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry speaking with Iranian officials including his counterpart, Javad Zarif, after the agreement was reached in Vienna in July 2015. WASHINGTON—The Obama administration secretly organized an airlift of $400 million worth of cash to Iran that coincided with the January release of four Americans detained in Tehran, according to U.S. and European officials and congressional staff briefed on the operation afterward. Wooden pallets stacked with euros, Swiss francs and other currencies were flown into Iran on an unmarked cargo plane, according to these officials. The U.S. procured the money from the central banks of the Netherlands and Switzerland, they said. The money represented the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement the Obama administration reached with Iran to resolve a decades-old dispute over a failed arms deal signed just before the 1979 fall of Iran’s last monarch, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The settlement, which resolved claims before an international tribunal in The Hague, also coincided with the formal implementation that same weekend of the landmark nuclear agreement reached between Tehran, the U.S. and other global powers the summer before. “With the nuclear deal done, prisoners released, the time was right to resolve this dispute as well,” President Barack Obama said at the White House on Jan. 17—without disclosing the $400 million cash payment.

11aea5b0	By Jim Francesconi As we pass the governance torch from the State Board of Higher Education to independent boards at the University of Oregon, Portland State University and Oregon State University, we will be navigating a future of heightened risks and rewards. The rewards lie in the private sector reinforcements that are coming to the aid of our three major research universities. The caliber of some board nominees are similar to those found at Stanford, Yale, Harvard and other prestigious private universities. Major Oregon CEOs and entrepreneurs have volunteered to use their power, influence and resources to benefit Oregon's public universities. Oregon is a small state with limited public resources, great needs and high aspirations. Although our universities have a few of the nation's best programs, we are not living up to our potential. That is what happens when state funding for becomes mired near the bottom of all states for more than 20 years. Now there is the promise to leverage private resources for this vital public purpose. But there are risks as well. We need high-quality engineering and other research programs, but we cannot afford them at every campus. Portland needs to be served, with PSU in charge, but so does every part of our state. Our small schools should be strengthened, not sacrificed. Sports are important, but not the highest priority. As vital as universities are, they are means to public ends, not ends in and of themselves. Oregon needs a vibrant, innovative economy. Our universities can create more research collaboratives such as ONAMI (Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute) and the Portland Life Sciences center, which attract world-class talent and create jobs. Next up ... the Light Metals Institute sponsored by Oregon and Washington universities and the Manufacturing 21 business coalition. Oregon's per capita income is almost 10 percent below the national average. Universities can prepare more Oregonians for well-paid jobs in health care, STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, mathematics), advanced manufacturing and professional-technical careers. And we should take advantage of the growing demographic and political strength of the Latino community by working together to provide access to college and to family-wage jobs. Above all, Oregon must demonstrate that working people and poor folks can still make it in America. Education after high school is the way, but it is out of reach for many children, especially in rural Oregon. Nearly half of Oregon's children are poor. Half of Oregon university students are on Pell Grants. The average student debt is more than $25,000. As a result, fewer Oregonians are going to college. Like many, my grandparents and parents sacrificed so that I could be the first in my family to go to college. For the first time in Oregon's history, my generation is better educated than the generation that is now college age. New university board members can raise scholarship funds so that more Oregonians can graduate from UO, PSU and OSU. But these board members should also help increase philanthropy at Southern, Western, Eastern and the Oregon Institute of Technology. All Oregonians from every part of the state should have a chance to achieve their potential and contribute to our state. Finally, we must understand that philanthropy alone cannot produce excellent universities with innovative research, quality instruction and access for all Oregonians. The Legislature has consistently balanced the budget on the backs of students, forcing tuition increases. New board members have the power to reverse this practice and to force major public investments in our universities for the good of Oregon. Let us work together to apply that power to building an affordable and accessible world-class university system. Jim Francesconi is a member of the State Board of Higher Education and lives in Northeast Portland.

9d3ac1f0	Three in four labour wards have no consultants overnight. A major audit published today also reveals that almost half of hospitals lack senior specialists at weekends. And just two out of 165 maternity units had a consultant present round the clock, according to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Scroll down for video A major audit published today also reveals that almost half of hospitals lack senior specialists at weekends. Stock image Mothers-to-be are instead left in the hands of overstretched midwives and inexperienced and often exhausted junior doctors. Although consultants are on call from home, they can live up to 30 minutes away and staff summon them only in emergencies. More than half of births take place out of hours. And research shows that babies born then are a third more likely to die or suffer serious complications. The royal college obtained the figures from 165 NHS maternity units – 82 per cent of the total. They show that: Just over 73 per cent had no consultants on the weekday overnight shift, typically 10pm to 8am; Another 43 per cent said none were on site at weekends; 89 per cent said consultants were not present for evening shifts at weekends; Heart of England NHS trust in Birmingham and Central Manchester University were the only centres with consultants day and night, all week. Maureen Treadwell, of the Birth Trauma Association, said: ‘We are concerned at the number of hospital trusts with no consultant cover at night. ‘There are a number of rare but sudden catastrophic events in labour where a less experienced doctor may need the advice or assistance of a senior colleague. ‘These are not common events, but every year some women and babies will die as a result of substandard care, often from staff who are doing their best, but may never have dealt with such a condition.’ The figures are worrying because labours are becoming more complex due to obesity and the trend for women to have babies later in life. Experts say midwives and junior doctors are less likely to spot when things go wrong and can be reluctant to summon the help of consultants. Labour wards are also under pressure because of high birth rates fuelled by migration. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s health spokesman, said it shows that the Tories can;t even deliver a five-day NHS Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘It is crucial that maternity units are sufficiently staffed to provide a high level of care to all who use them – day or night. ‘The Tories talk about a seven-day NHS but these figures show they can’t even deliver a five-day NHS.’ Elizabeth Duff of the National Childbirth Trust said: ‘Women need safe maternity services whenever they give birth. We know more needs to be done to provide the right level of staff to give support when necessary.’ The royal college issued recommendations in 2009 stating that maternity units should work toward having consultants present round the clock. This would improve the care of women and the training of junior staff, the guidelines stated. Consultants are supposed to supervise the care of all patients in maternity units and intervene if something goes wrong. A major study by Imperial College London last year found that babies delivered at the weekend were 7 per cent more likely to be stillborn. And research published by Cambridge University in 2010 found that babies born overnight or at weekends in Scottish hospitals were a third more likely to die. MY BABY WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY IF I'D HAD HER IN THE WEEK Angela Owens pictured with baby Hope believes her daughter Ella would be alive today had she given birth on a weekday Angela Owens believes her daughter Ella would be alive today had she given birth on a weekday. She was two weeks overdue when she felt severe and sudden pain on a Saturday afternoon four days before Christmas 2013. The 31-year-old went to the labour ward at Warrington Hospital, describing it as a ghost town. Midwives repeatedly told her to go home and take paracetamol – and ignored her pleas for a consultant. Eventually – after her GP brother arrived – they bleeped the consultant but by this stage it was too late. When Ella was finally delivered on 11pm on the Saturday she was stillborn. The mother, who has two other daughters with her partner Paul, said: ‘There was a general flippant attitude towards me,’ ‘You put your trust in health staff in these situations, but I had to beg them for help. ‘Hospitals seem to go into sleep mode at the weekends and for us this resulted in the ultimate tragedy. It was horrendous. I will never recover from her death.’ Ella was one of ten babies who had been stillborn or died in unexplained circumstances at Warrington Hospital in a 12-month period between 2013/14. The deaths were avoidable and blamed on staffing shortages – half occurred at weekends. Advertisement The authors said the same would be true for English hospitals. They blamed the extra risks on a lack of intervention by junior doctors. NHS figures show that doctors performed almost 40 per cent of births in 2014/15 and midwives do most of the remainder. They do not state whether the former were consultants or junior doctors. But the figure has steadily increased from 24 per cent in 1989. An NHS England spokesman said: ‘Having a baby is now safer than it has ever been and the vast majority of mothers report that they get great NHS maternity care.’ The spokesman highlighted a study last year that claimed there was no evidence to show overnight consultants made any difference to safety. But he refused to acknowledge other research showing babies born out of hours were more likely to die. Tomorrow the NHS will publish its first-ever Ofsted-style ratings for maternity care in a bid to drive up standards.	‘It won’t simply be sanctions’: Biden adviser threatens to punish Russia with ‘tools seen & unseen’ for SolarWinds hack	true
645808de	Rainsy’s conviction a ‘legal matter, not a political one’ A picture taken outside of Cambodia of Sam Rainsy C,L and the seven other former CNRP lawmakers convicted over the coup plot. A picture taken outside of Cambodia of Sam Rainsy C,L and the seven other former CNRP lawmakers convicted over the coup plot. Facebook Government officials have defended the Phnom Penh Municipal Court’s conviction of former opposition leader Sam Rainsy and eight other senior officials over a plot to topple the government amid criticism over the move. Ministry of Justice spokesman Chin Malin said yesterday that the court’s decision against former opposition leaders was made according to the law, saying the court had enough arguments to prosecute them. “More importantly, the authorities have acted in accordance with legal procedures, and the courts conducted the trial based on procedure and made decisions based on the facts and existing legal aspects,” he said. Presiding Judge Duch Sok Sarin on Monday sentenced Rainsy, who is living in exile, to 25 years in jail, while Mu Sochua and Eng Chhai Eang, both vice-presidents and former lawmakers of the ex-CNRP, were sentenced to 22 years in jail each. The judge also sentenced six other ex-CNRP lawmakers to 20 years in jail each after they were found guilty of attempting to “attack” the government. They are Rainsy’s wife Tioulong Saumura, Ou Chanrith, Ho Vann, Long Ry, Men Thavarin and Nuth Romduol. All of them are living in exile abroad. The convicts were deprived of their right to vote and the right to stand for election. Rainsy vowed to return to the Kingdom to restore democracy and human rights on November 9, 2019, but his planned return failed to materialise. However, the government accused him and his allies of planning a coup. In his statement on the conviction, Rainsy said it was simply a “political statement” born out of weakness and fear. “Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen is afraid of any risk of my returning to the Cambodian political scene. He also dreads the prospect of any free and fair election which would inevitably lead to the end of his current autocratic and anachronistic regime,” he said. Rainsy claimed Mr Hun Sen has repeatedly refused to allow him and other leading figures of the ex-CNRP to return to Cambodia, saying the sentence is simply intended to intimidate ex-CNRP supporters within the country. However, Malin said ex-CNRP leaders have never acknowledged their wrongdoing. “It is normal for them to never admit their mistakes. As a justification, the perpetrator never admits that he has committed a crime,” Malin added. In its statement, the court-dissolved CNRP described the verdict as: “Cambodia’s politicised court confirms the coup and abolition of democracy”. It said it fully denies all charges and resolutely rejects the verdict. It added that 130 members of the ex-CNRP have been kept in pre-trial detention over the past year and charged as accomplices of the nine CNRP leaders. “The international community must respond to these intolerable developments in an equally determined way,” it added. “These sentences have to be denounced, rejected and ultimately withdrawn.” The US Embassy in Phnom Penh yesterday said it was troubled by the sentences handed down against the nine Cambodian political opposition leaders, including some who are also American citizens. “These sentences are part of a series of mass trials against more than 130 political opposition supporters and civil society activists, which lack basic due process,” it said. “We urge the government of Cambodia to protect freedoms of expression and association, as enshrined in the country’s constitution, and call on authorities to take meaningful steps to reopen civic and political space in the lead up to the 2022 Commune Election and the 2023 National Election,” it added. However, Cambodian People’s Party spokesman Sok Eysan said yesterday that the conviction will result in ex-CNRP leaders no longer being able to enter and participate in the 2022 and 2023 Commune and National Elections. He said the political life of the ex-CNRP leaders has come to an end because of their bad intentions against the people and nation. “The case is a legal matter, not a political one.”	Why Scientists DisagreeAbout Global Warming The NIPCC Reporton Scientific Consensus	false
80c02218	Sajid Javid pictured was last night facing an all-out revolt over business rates  Theresa May retains 'full confidence' in Communities Secretary Sajid Javid despite him facing an all out revolt over business rates.  The embattled Cabinet minister has insisted critics of the business rate revaluation have been misled by a 'relentless campaign of distortions and half-truths'.  But Mr Javid is facing claims from Tory colleagues that he is 'spinning the numbers' and a letter sent to calm down the row played down the rises.  As the row threatened to boil over, Mrs May's official spokesman was asked if the PM continued to have full confidence in Mr Javid.  He replied: 'Yes.'  The Government insists 73 per cent of firms will have the same rates or lower bills - but this leave 510,000 companies facing higher charges.  In a letter, Mr Javid begged MPs to reassure their constituents about the changes, arguing that three quarters of businesses will see their rates frozen or cut.  But last night Mr Javid was accused of peddling misinformation of his own as a new analysis suggested the Government's figures were inaccurate. The study said the bills that firms will actually receive over the next few weeks will be 7 percentage points higher on average than ministers say.  This is because 2 per cent inflation has not been factored in and the Government has assumed that its appeals system will give 5 per cent rebates to all firms – despite challenges being harder and more costly to mount.  Ex minister Grant Shapps today accused Mr Javid of 'spinning the numbers'.  He told Sky News: 'It has been suggested by Government this is fiscally neutral but it raises £1bn.  'Better just to say that, rather than spin it out as something which actually saves businesses money when it doesn't.'  Ex-minister Grant Shapps today accused Mr Javid of 'spinning the numbers' in the row over a revaluation of business rates  Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said he challenged Chancellor Philip Hammond about the disputed figures at a meeting of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee yesterday.  'I'm disappointed that it would appear that the figures we were given did not set out the actual position,' he said. 'The list sets out a best case scenario. I challenged the Chancellor on it but I received no answer.'  Mr Javid's letter – also signed by Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke – said rates would fall in 250 of the 329 local billing authority areas in England – and detailed these in a list accompanying the letter.  According to an analysis by ratings specialist Gerald Eve, rates will fall in only 135 councils – and increase in 191.  Basildon, Harrogate, Canterbury and Stafford are among 124 local authorities in line for an overall hike in business rates, as opposed to the cut promised by the Government. Basildon will see business rates rise by 0.15 per cent, instead of fall by 6.3 per cent. Harrogate will see a 2.27 per cent jump, as opposed to a 4.3 per cent cut, and Canterbury will see a 0.92 per cent hike, rather than a 4.3 per cent fall.  The Communities Secretary claims small firms have been misled by a 'relentless campaign of distortions and half-truths'  The analysis says Theresa May's Maidenhead constituency will see a 15.75 per cent increase in business rates – rather than a 8.3 per cent rise claimed in the list accompanying Mr Javid's letter.  At the same time, the fall in rates in Mr Javid's Bromsgrove constituency will only be 9.29 per cent – as opposed to the Government's figure of 15.2 per cent  Jerry Schurder, head of business rates at Gerald Eve, said last night: 'The figures provided to Tory MPs show that the Department for Communities is living in a parallel universe, one where there is no inflation and an automated appeals system that gives 5 per cent rates rebates across the board.  Theresa May, pictured yesterday on the campaign trail in the Stoke by-election, retains confidence in Sajid Javid despite the furore over business rates  'But back in the real world, the bills that will land on doormats in the next few weeks will be around 7 per cent higher than these figures suggest, while appeals will be become both more expensive and less likely to succeed as the Government seeks to disincentivise businesses from challenging their bills.'  The Department for Communities and Local Government last night rejected claims that the figures were misleading. It referred the Mail to the small print which states: 'The average change in bills is before any inflation or appeals adjustments have been made.'  Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: 'Sajid Javid complained about half truths and then he puts out this guff. These figures are pure misinformation and half truths.The Government should be ashamed of themselves. They are spinning so much on this issue they are making everyone dizzy.  'While they put our data strewn with errors, small businesses are panicking about the impact of these massive rate hikes. It is time for a U-turn. The Government need to make it soon.'  Mr Javid was also under fire from business groups, MPs and small firms, which claimed he had also omitted key information from his letter about the devastating impact rate rises will have.  The Institute of Directors described Mr Javid's failure to mention the half a million firms that will see their rates go up as 'disingenuous' and warned that 'tens of thousands' could go bust.  Stephen Herring, the IoD's head of taxation, said: 'The Government is right that many businesses will see their rate bills go down, but the issue is the sudden and dramatic increases that many high street shops and pubs are having to deal with. It is disingenuous to focus on average rate reductions and ignore the fact that many small firms are facing huge rate hikes. We could see tens of thousands of firms go bust.'  The British Retail Consortium said in a statement: 'No one is a winner from this revaluation. Business rates have increased from a third of rental value in 1990 to half today.  Amanda Wrigley and her mother Shirley outside their shop Hirst Antiques, in Notting Hill, which is facing a big hike in business rates  'This is the highest commercial property tax in the developed world.The current system is not fit for purpose in the 21st century and needs fundamental reform.'  One antiques dealer said the rates hike could be the 'final nail in the coffin' for many struggling high street retailers.  Amanda Wrigley runs Hirst Antiques in Notting Hill, London, with her mother Shirley Hirst, who founded the business 53 years ago. Miss Wrigley, 36, said her rates would double while chains faced much smaller increases.  She told the Mail: 'This is not a myth. We're not making this up. This is going to affect business across the country. A lot of us are feeling the pinch already – but this could be the final nail in the coffin.  'My mum is still working at the age of 80 and enjoys what she does. But it's a lot less fun when first our rent and then out rates go up. It makes us wonder how we're going to make it work.'  Yesterday another ratings specialist said Mr Javid had also failed to mention that thousands of firms in line for the biggest cuts to business rates will not benefit for the full reduction for years because of transitional arrangements.  Analysis from ratings specialist Daniel Watney found half of firms set for the biggest rate cuts will not receive the full reduction for three years – and one in five will not see the full benefit at all before rates are revalued again in five years.  A Government spokesman said: 'These are completely spurious claims by ratings agents with more interest in their own profits than a fair deal for businesses.  'We have been clear how our figures are calculated and what they include. In fact the revaluation of business rates means three quarters of businesses will see a fall, or no change, in their bills – 600,000 small businesses will pay no rates at all.  'Far from stopping anyone appealing their bills, or setting a margin of error, our reforms will mean businesses will no longer need to go through these scaremongering ratings agencies but instead can check, challenge and appeal their bills quickly and easily.'  Debunked: Minister's claim hikes are a myth  Analysis by Business Correspondent James Salmon  Sajid Javid has written directly to MPs to try to quell the rebellion against his business rates reforms. The Communities Secretary insisted the row was based on 'myths'. But business groups last night accused him of peddling half-truths of his own.  JAVID'S CLAIM  He says the first 'myth' about revaluation is that there will be 'across the board rate rises'.  REALITY  Nobody has been claiming that most businesses will see their business rates rise. Mr Javid points out that the revaluation will lift around 600,000 smaller firms out of paying business rates, while around 740,000 will see their rates frozen. But there is no mention of government figures showing around half a million business will see an increase in their rates of up to 300 per cent.  The minister also hails the 'unprecedented £6.7billion package of rate relief' to ensure that those facing the biggest rate hikes see them phased in gradually. But what Mr Javid omits to say is that those firms that have been lined up for cuts will not enjoy the full benefits for years. A 'downwards cap' on rate reductions means small firms can see their rates trimmed by a maximum of 20 per cent in 2017/18.  These caps are even stricter for medium and larger firms – which will receive a maximum discount of 4.1 per cent in the first year of the new regime. The reliefs are likely to come too late for the thousands of businesses already paying over the odds because the last revaluation was carried out at the height of the pre-credit crisis property boom in 2008.  According to business rates expert Daniel Watney, half of properties seeing the biggest falls in rates will not benefit from their full rates cut for three years, while one in five will not see their full rates cut before the next revaluation in five years.  CLAIM  Revaluation is 'emphatically not being used to hide a stealth rise in taxes'.  REALITY  Government figures suggest the revaluation will raise an additional £1billion in the first year alone. Business rates will raise £25.5billion in 2017-18, after the changes are introduced on April 1, up from £24.5billion this year.  Mr Javid has insisted this is simply because the number of businesses is expected to grow, with some expanding or renovating premises. This means more, and bigger businesses, will be paying into the pot.  But the British Retail Consortium and Institute of Directors both fear the reforms will drive many traders to the wall, meaning any increase in revenues to the Exchequer will have to come from firms paying more.  claim Suggestions that the rates review will devastate high streets are 'simply not true'.  Reality Again, Mr Javid appears to have deliberately misinterpreted or ignored warnings from business leaders. Lobby groups – including the Institute of Directors and the British Retail Consortium – have never suggested that hundreds of thousands of firms will go bust.  However, given that more than half a million enterprises will see their rates shoot up by up 300 per cent, the IoD believes that tens of thousands of pubs and restaurants which are already struggling, will be tipped over the edge. Retail expert Mary Portas has warned that the revaluation will 'cripple' high street shops in areas where house prices have increased.  'The tax bill which will hit retailers from April will be the single biggest blow to independent shops since the financial crisis,' she said. 'I would estimate that at least a third of them will die.'  CLAIM  The Government is 'reforming the appeals process to make it easier for business to check, challenge and appeal their bills'.  REALITY  It will become tougher and more expensive for firms to appeal, once a complaint has been rejected by the Government's Valuation Tribunal. What Mr Javid fails to mention in his letter is that the Government is introducing new charges of £150 for small firms just to appeal their rate to a tribunal. Larger companies will have to pay £300.  The Government also plans to fine businesses up to £500 if they make a 'careless' or deliberate mistake while filling out their forms. Officials claim it will deter businesses from lodging speculative appeals backed with little or no evidence. This should help to clear a backlog of 280,000 appeal cases that stretch back to 2010.  But several other changes have also been made to the appeals process that will make it harder for businesses to complain.  Previously, it was a two-stage process involving a simple form and no fees were charged. Now, it is expected to become a three-stage process, including an initial 'checking' stage where firms must confirm that every part of their property which the valuation is based on is accurate.  Experts say that businesses will also be required to submit more formal evidence than before. If the appeal has still not been resolved, the final stage is a tribunal, when a fee is charged.	PM May stands by Sajd Javid after business rates dossier	partially false
7043de09	Theresa May’s government is under pressure to explain claims that it neglected to improve fire safety in buildings despite warnings about the potential for tragedies like that at Grenfell House tower block.  Gavin Barwell, the Prime Minister’s new chief of staff, failed to give the go-ahead to a safety review during his tenure as housing minister, despite it already having been delayed for years.  His predecessor as housing minister Brandon Lewis declined to bring in regulation forcing developers to fit sprinklers because he said it was not the Government's responsibility.  Jeremy Corbyn ramped up pressure by calling for Mr Barwell and others who had failed to act on calls for a safety review to face questioning.  Recommended Theresa May promises to investigate Grenfell Tower disaster  Theresa May ordered an urgent meeting of officials on Wednesday afternoon to ensure authorities were best placed to deal with the fire and its fallout, with the group concluding that checks should be carried out other blocks.  In 2013 the All-Party Parliamentary Fire Safety & Rescue Group called for a review of safety regulation, after six people died and more than 20 were hurt in the 2009 blaze at Lakanal House in Camberwell .  But the group’s honorary administrative secretary, Ronnie King, said successive ministers had failed to carry out the review that the group’s report called for.

He added: “Our group recommended that due to the speed that the fire spread in Lakanal House, that building regulations should be reviewed.  “It's nearly 11 years since it has been reviewed.”  Grenfell tower fire Show all 42 1 /42 Grenfell tower fire Grenfell tower fire Local residents watch as Grenfell Tower is engulfed by fire Getty Images Grenfell tower fire London Fire Brigade said there has been a number of fatalities from the blaze Rex Features Grenfell tower fire The fire was first reported in the early hours of Wednesday and continued into the morning Rex Features Grenfell tower fire A local resident sees the fire over the rooftops @Ebajgora Grenfell tower fire A firefighter reacts at the scene of the blaze Getty Images Grenfell tower fire Residents watch as the blaze continues Getty Images Grenfell tower fire More than 200 firefighters have been fighting the blaze PA Grenfell tower fire London Mayor Sadiq Khan has declared the fire a major incident Getty Images Grenfell tower fire Police and fire services attempted to evacuate the concrete block of flats Getty Images Grenfell tower fire A woman runs to assist paramedics working at the fire at the Grenfell Tower Getty Images Grenfell tower fire Smoke rises from the building after a huge fire engulfed the 24 story Grenfell Tower in Latimer Road, West London in the early hours of Wednesday morning Getty Images Grenfell tower fire Fire fighters tackle the 24-storey building in West London Getty Images Grenfell tower fire Ambulances are stationed nearby Getty Images Grenfell tower fire Paramedics arrive with oxygen Getty Images Grenfell tower fire Emergency services believe it will take some time to establish the cause of the fire Grenfell tower fire Tens of people have been taken to five different hospitals across London Getty Images Grenfell tower fire A man comforts a boy after the tower block was severely damaged Reuters Grenfell tower fire Firefighters stand amid debris in a childrens playground nearby Reuters Grenfell tower fire Firefighters are stationed at the building Getty Images Grenfell tower fire Smoke engulfs Grenfell tower Rex Features Grenfell tower fire Lots of people donating water, food and clothing to St Clement's church for the residents of Grenfell Tower in Latimer Road Samuel Osborne Grenfell tower fire A man speaks to a fire fighter after a huge fire engulfed the 24 story Grenfell Tower in Latimer Road, West London Getty Images Grenfell tower fire According to the London Fire Brigade LFB, 40 fire engines and 200 firefighters are working to put out the blaze.

He added: “Mr Barwell said he was still looking at it and was preparing to meet with the All-Party group. That's when the election was called and the meeting never happened.”  As the Grenfell death toll rose to 12, it also emerged that Mr Lewis, recently promoted to immigration minister, had declined in 2014 to force building developers to fit sprinklers.  The coroner's report into Lakanal House had recommended regulations be updated, and called for developers refurbishing high-rise blocks to be encouraged to install sprinkler systems.  But five years later, Mr Lewis told MPs: “We believe that it is the responsibility of the fire industry, rather than the Government, to market fire sprinkler systems effectively and to encourage their wider installation.”  He said the Tory government had committed to being the first to reduce regulations nationwide, pledging a one-in-two-out rule.  He added: “The cost of fitting a fire sprinkler system may affect house building – something we want to encourage – so we must wait to see what impact that regulation has.”  ✕ Grenfell fire update: 12 dead with death toll expected to rise  Mr Corbyn hit out at the Government’s record demanding that ministers be forced to answer questions on fire safety.  Suggesting spending cuts may also have a role to play, he said: “If you deny local authorities the funding they need, then there is a price that’s paid.”  He went on: “A review took place after the fire in Camberwell and the Government has that review.  “I believe we need to ask questions about what facilities and resources have been given to local authorities that have tower blocs in the area and, frankly, most do. We need to deal with this, we need people to be safe living in high rise buildings.”  Asked whether that involved any current serving frontbench politicians, he replied: “Obviously ministers that served and received those reports must be questioned. But today every focus and every concentration must be on saving and protecting life.”  A government spokesman said that following the Lakanal House fire, the coroner recommended the guidance relating to fire safety within the building regulations be simplified, work he said is on-going.  The coroner also asked government to write to councils encouraging them to consider retro-fitting sprinklers, he said, adding that it had happened.  The fire-damaged lower floors of the 24-storey residential Grenfell Tower block Leon Neal/Getty Images  The spokesman added: “Our thoughts are with the residents and families of everyone caught up in this dreadful event. We stand ready to help in anyway possible as the emergency services continue to stabilise the situation.  “The London Fire Brigade will be conducting their investigation and at this stage it would not be appropriate to comment on the cause of the fire.”  The cause of the fire is so far unknown, but residents had previously raised concerns that a 'catastrophic' event could happen, with an action group claiming that their warnings fell on “deaf ears”.  The group said there was one entry and exit to Grenfell Tower during improvement works at the block in Latimer Road and it had issues with evacuation procedures.  Following the fire, the group posted: “All our warnings fell on deaf ears and we predicted that a catastrophe like this was inevitable and just a matter of time.”  Grenfell was fitted with zinc rainscreen cladding and glazed curtain walling after a £10m refurbishment and some have suggested this could have exacerbated the spread of the fire, though the firm that carried out the work said it all met safety regulations.  Announcing an urgent meeting of ministers and officials in the wake of the fire, the Prime Minister said she was “deeply saddened”.  After the session finished Policing and Fire Minister Nick Hurd said they wanted to provide reassurance to people living in other buildings as soon as possible.  He said: “We have discussed with the Department for Communities and Local Government, local authorities and the fire service a process whereby we seek to identify towers that might have a similar process of refurbishment, run a system of checks so that we can, as quickly as possible, give reassurance to people.”  London Mayor Sadiq Khan said there are “questions that have to be answered” after residents of the tower were told to stay in their flats in the event of a fire.  Mr Khan condemned the “bad advice” given to residents of the west London tower block that was engulfed in flames overnight, killing several inhabitants and leaving many trapped inside the burning building.  A newsletter to residents in 2014 said the “stay put” policy worked because the block had been designed according to “rigorous fire safety standards”.

c9a08752	Tom Clark: Osborne swung his axe without mercy  Still bathing in the glow of the Conservatives’ unexpected election success, George Osborne is now determined to repeat his newly vindicated tricks during the old parliament in the new one. At the dawn of the coalition, in his first budget in June 2010, the new chancellor established one convenient untruth: that the great recession had been caused by Labour’s wild way with spending. Britain’s emergency, he said, was about state largesse “crowding out private endeavour”.  He has used the first budget of the new parliament to establish a second important untruth. Namely, that poverty in Britain is in some curious sense the product of the government having given poor people too much money. As the chancellor savaged family tax credits, he was shameless in skating over how these are in fact the building blocks for the Tories’ own universal credit, which he is undermining before it has even got going. He was shameless, too, in forgetting how he himself had – during the days when David Cameron’s Tories were still interested in projecting a moderate face – felt it necessary to increase the main tax credit rate to protect poor children. Now the credits were presented, plain and simple, as the wicked legacy of Gordon Brown, which ensnared the poor in a hideous system of bureaucracy.  Sheltering behind an eye-catching rise and rebranding of the minimum wage, which will have less effect than the headlines suggest because it is restricted to over-25s, Osborne swung his axe without mercy. Children will be cut out of the system, and therefore impoverished, simply because they have been born into bigger families. Forget the hype about a workers’ budget: low earners will be able to keep less of their pay packet before they start losing benefits. The very perversities that the universal credit pretends to solve will therefore intensify for those at the bottom of the heap. What a contrast with the position of others, higher up the pay scale, who will enjoy real income tax cuts.  Polly Toynbee: A return to public squalor and private excess  Keep your eyes on their prize – the deep and permanent shrinking of the state. Ignore the confetti of distractions – look where we are headed. The “low tax, low welfare” UK state will be smaller even than the US as a proportion of GDP by 2019 – far from the European social democratic norm.  Before these cuts, the IMF and OECD projected the UK state would fall to 36.6%, very close to the US at 35%. Germany is at 45.4%. Today’s £12bn welfare cuts add another 1.6%, so UK spending will fall below America’s.  Government is shrivelling, the welfare state dwindling. Everything that makes people proud is waning, from science to the arts, transport, libraries, sports, parks and swimming pools. It’s back to public squalor amid private excess.  Tories are liberated to reward the haves and batter the have-nothings. Hurrah for a £1m inheritance tax bonus for the richest 6% of families, despite the 100 wealthiest people owning as much as 19 million others. Cut corporation tax, while a FTSE-100 chief executive earns in three days what an average worker gets in a year.  Don’t be deceived by a minimum wage rise that doesn’t begin to compensate for drastic tax credit cuts or the £30 a week stripped from employment and support allowance. Tax cuts don’t help the 6 million too low-paid to pay tax. Housing benefit cuts will cleanse the poor from the south-east.  This was indeed an “emergency” budget for the poor, for children, for students. Osborne sneered in the Sun that he expected “depressingly predictable howls of protest”. Well, start howling now.  Matthew d’Ancona: A resounding victory for the modernising Tories    Shortly before George Osborne stood up to deliver his remarkable budget, a senior Conservative called me to say that there would be an announcement that would “round off” the long march of Tory modernisation. As it turns out, that prognosis was spot on. A process that began a decade ago with David Cameron’s recycled trainers and a photo-op with huskies ends for now in the momentous introduction of a national living wage.  There were clues, of course. Osborne is an astute political strategist who would never have hit welfare as hard as he did today without a balancing innovation to secure his party’s one-nation credentials. Taking a hatchet to tax credits, he had to offer a political quid pro quo, a measure that will start the process of making such credits unnecessary.  Why, after all, should the taxpayer subsidise the parsimony of employers? If ever there was an idea whose time has come, it is this one. Steve Hilton was often Osborne’s rival, but thanks him in the acknowledgments of his recent book, More Human. In the chapter on poverty, Hilton develops an argument for the national living wage that is to my mind unanswerable: what is the state doing he asks propping up companies that will not pay their employees a decent wage? Tories instinctively hate interventions in the labour market and warned of mass unemployment when New Labour introduced the national minimum wage. Even now, there will be Conservatives who recoil from this enlightened measure.  But the modernising wing of the party was investing ever more heavily in this particular idea. In this week’s Observer, Rohan Silva, a close friend of both Hilton and Osborne, who worked for Cameron in No 10, issued a passionate call for a compulsory living wage. This much is certain: Silva would never have sought to embarrass the chancellor on the eve of the first Conservative budget since 1996. At the very least, his article indicated the direction of travel.  Tory modernisers have always argued that the party is at its best when securing progressive ends by Tory means. Same-sex marriage was one such example. This is another. It is the right thing to do in principle, but it is also an audacious land grab by Osborne, colonising terrain that has long been Labour’s sovereign soil. What will the leadership contenders have to say about this almighty twist in the tale? And will the Tory right be able to stop themselves from ruining it? Stay tuned.  Gaby Hinsliff: Osborne’s cunning trick will leave Labour floundering  The key thing to remember whenever chancellors produce rabbits from hats is that rabbits aren’t actually native to hats. It takes considerable sleight-of-hand to force the damn things in there. Tempting as it is to gawp solely at the rabbit – a compulsory £9-an-hour living wage for all! – it’s usually better to focus gimlet-eyed on the hand. And George Osborne’s was busy rifling pockets.  What he unveiled was actually a more generous than expected rise in the minimum wage, not a living one, since in London the living wage is already £9.15 it’s £7.85 elsewhere and who knows where it might be by 2020. It’s not enough to set good times rolling for families who will start losing tax credits before the £9 minimum kicks in; or to compensate for stunts like the shameless scrapping of student maintenance grants, which unlike tuition fees will directly hit kids from poor families destined for university. The gulf between working people and jobless ones - particularly those sick enough still to get ESA despite tougher new ‘fitness to work’ tests, who will now receive no more than ordinary job seekers’ allowance – will meanwhile widen sharply. There’s trouble ahead.  But the immediate result is to leave Labour floundering, its critique of the Tories as providers of low-wage dead-end jobs in pieces; and there were just enough unexpected moves – curbing the buy-to-let boom by reducing landlords’ tax relief, ending permanent non-dom status – to keep things unpredictable. Osborne’s reputation as a political, if not economic, strategist – and thus his own career prospects – can only be enhanced.  Aditya Chakrabortty: A serious invasion into Labour territory – but not a substantive one  Not content with merely beating Labour in the election, the Tory’s cleverest strategist George Osborne now wants to nick most of their clothes – then club them to death.  This was much more than a victory lap of a budget. Fresh from May’s election win, delivering the first true-blue budget in nearly a quarter of a century, the chancellor could have just stood up, reiterated the measures his minions have been leaking to the papers for the past fortnight and sat down to a roaring ovation. But this afternoon he went so much further, and launched a serious invasion into Labour territory.  First came the finger-jabbing at the opposite side and the references to the Tories being the party to keep its promises. The repeated avowals that the Conservatives were the party of workers. The harking on about establishing the northern powerhouse in Labour heartland and the offer to work with cities across the north of England. Then came the crackdown on non-doms – not hard enough, but much better than anything Blair and Brown managed in their 13 years.  Finally, the rebadging of the minimum wage to being “the national living wage” and the commitment to raise it to £9 an hour by 2020, for those aged 25 and over. Compare that with Ed Miliband’s pre-election pledge to raise the minimum wage to £8 an hour by the end of this decade. Forget about Red Ed, the chancellor appeared to be saying: I am Red George.  So runs the rhetoric, at least. Look at the detail and it is not especially progressive, of course. The rise in the minimum wage is great news – but is undermined by the hacking away at tax credits. I’ll wait to see the impact assessments, but my guess is that low-paid families with children will still be poorer at the end of this decade.  Then think about the cut in inheritance tax – introduced by a Treasury that previously judged that “there are not strong economic arguments for introducing an inheritance tax exemption specifically related to main residences”. Who gains from this apparent dog of an idea? “Disproportionately” the very richest in society, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.  Consider the reduction in corporation tax – in a country that already has lower corporation tax rates and more generous corporation tax benefits than the US, Germany or any of our major competitors. As we reported in the Guardian this week, the government that is lopping billions from the social welfare budget hands businesses £93bn a year in direct corporate welfare – the equivalent of £3,500 from each and every household in Britain.  Look at the utterly bizarre attacks on housing associations, already struggling to keep on top of the benefits changes imposed on their tenants. Now Osborne wants to go further by forcing them to sell their houses at a discount and cut rent – houses he doesn’t own and rent he doesn’t collect.  But then look across at a Labour frontbench in disarray at the prospect of spending another decade out of power, too frightened to say anything leftwing. Her Majesty’s opposition is retreating from their own territory – leaving Osborne to rush in and plant a big blue flag on it. Do not underestimate the political seriousness behind this budget: just like the last Conservative governments of Thatcher and Lawson and Major, this administration is getting together a cogent true-blue appeal to working- and middle-class voters. Yes, it’s cruel to those in low-paid or no work, even while directing cash to the richest. But I wouldn’t bet on a timid, uninspired Labour party to point that out – or defend its own turf.	Budget 2015: the verdict from our columnists	true
753da2b7	What is the coronavirus?  A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown.  The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2.  Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it.  The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.  Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals.  'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease Severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS coronaviruses.  'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.'  The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31.  By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge.  The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.  Where does the virus come from?  According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats. Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals – the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively.  The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation.  Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat.  A study by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats.  However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was.  Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China.  'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.'  So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it?  Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly.  It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19.  Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold.  Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them.  'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.'  If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die.  'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in.  'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.'  How does the virus spread?  The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms.  It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces.  Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person.  What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms?  Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms – but they may still be contagious during this time.  If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever high temperature. The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all.  In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.  Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why.  What have genetic tests revealed about the virus?  Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world.  This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause.  Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much – changing is known as mutating – much during the early stages of its spread.  However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people.  This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it.  More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately.  How dangerous is the virus?  The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people.  Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is.  However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true.  Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured?  The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain.  Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money.  No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above.  The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology.  Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people.  People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public.  And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill infection causes a raised temperature.  However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport.  Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic?  The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'.  Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world.

246c4405	A report by the National Audit Office has said schools face cuts of 8% in real terms by 2019-20. While the government said school funding would be ringfenced, headteachers are facing a mountain of increased costs: higher contributions to national insurance and teachers’ pensions, the introduction of the “national living wage”, pay rises and the apprenticeship levy. There’s no extra money for these, nor is funding per pupil rising in line with inflation. The NAO warned that cuts could put students’ “educational outcomes at risk”. To make matters worse, the education services grant, worth £600m, is also being cut, which means there will be less money for local authorities or academies to provide services such as school improvement.  Meanwhile, headteachers are nervously keeping an eye on proposals for a new funding formula for schools in 2018-19, expected to redistribute money from inner-city schools to rural areas. But even schools that are likely to gain under this model say any extra cash will be eaten up by increased costs.  ‘We’ve cut our counsellor’s hours despite suicide attempts’  Everything has been cut. We used to spend lots of money on speech therapy, especially in primary, but the number of hours has been cut. Our gangs worker has gone, our drugs worker has gone. These were important people in our area, where students need this support.  Our counsellor has had her hours cut. I have a number of students on suicide risk assessments because they have attempted suicide, either at home or at school. For those children, part of their risk assessment is that they see the therapist. Apart from one, who has become a school phobic, they’re all in and attending and mostly succeeding. I think you can attribute that to the therapy. My concern is that there’s a fairly big waiting list of kids who haven’t tried to kill themselves and I can’t get them into therapy, because we haven’t got enough capacity. There’s absolutely no help outside of school.  The only thing we haven’t cut is the classroom teachers, but staffing has become leaner. We’ve lost teaching assistants, admin staff, senior leaders and this has included redundancies. If a teaching assistant leaves, we replace them with someone cheaper – fewer hours or less responsibility. In the past three years we’ve lost 25 people.  At Christmas time, we used to get theatre companies in to do pantomimes, because a lot of our children’s families just don’t do that sort of thing. It would cost £350 and normally we’d ask for contributions from parents - we’d get £100 in and then we’d top it up. We can’t top it up any more. This year it didn’t happen.  The gap between my kids and some of the other schools in the area is widening at a frightening rate. Parents elsewhere are stepping up and paying for things. But in my school I’ve got more than one family per year group where this Christmas the kids didn’t get any presents and they sat in their bedrooms eating sandwiches. I can’t fix that, but I can try to make coming to school as much fun as possible. Headteacher, west of England      David Waugh, headteacher, Cheshire: ‘I can’t afford my own special needs coordinator, so I share. I’m a school of 1,500 and the other school has 1,100 students’  ‘I’m running nine-year-old computers’    I’ve got my training budget for staff down to £10,000 – I have 178 staff and the guidance says it should be around £70,000-£80,000. At a time when the government has changed every course, every exam curriculum, I’m struggling to cope with training my staff and I can’t afford to resource these courses.  I have 32 A-levels for my sixth formers at the moment, and I’m putting them into three categories: A-levels I’ll deliver myself, A-levels I’m going to have to find a different way of delivering, and A-levels I will never offer again. Some A-levels, such as music and languages, I may have to run jointly with other schools. I can’t afford my own special needs coordinator [who makes sure pupils with disabilities or special needs get the right support], so I share one with another school. I’m a school of 1,500 and the other school has 1,100 students. I’ve restructured everything. Over the last few years I’ve taken 13.2 full-time equivalent teaching staff out of the system through redundancy and non-replacement of staff. This includes two members of the senior leadership team. I don’t put any money into computers, I’m running nine-year-old computers.  There’s not a morose feeling in my school because it’s a bloody good school and people want to stay. But if I were in a different school, with a different demographic, it would be catastrophic.  As a local authority area, we are the sixth worst-funded schools in the country. A lot of us have been holding out for the national funding formula to save us. But Cheshire East will become officially the 150th in the list of 150 local authorities under the new funding formula. We’ll go from sixth worst to the worst. I can’t cut back any more. David Waugh, Poynton High School, Poynton, Cheshire  Sean Maher, headteacher, Greater London: ‘If we do not sort out the problem, within two to three years the system could implode.’  ‘We can’t offer computer science as we can’t afford a teacher’  Over the last three years we’ve adopted a policy of not replacing staff where we don’t have to, and last year we ended up making four people redundant. It was the most brutal thing I’ve ever had to do, it was just horrible.  If you’re in education and you’re working with children you want staff who are happy and pulling together – try doing that and also saying “some of you are losing your jobs”. It has a massive effect on the children. We rely so much on our teachers; we’re an outstanding school and do loads and loads of wider curricular activities. Staff do that without charge, through goodwill. They’re not going to keep doing things like that if morale isn’t high.  We’ve had to look at our curriculum offer and say “well we can’t offer computer science to this year group because we can’t replace that member of staff”.  With these new courses coming out across A-levels and GCSE, staff are coming to me and saying “I want £2,500 to buy a new set of textbooks”. I say “no, I can’t afford them, find another way to do it”. With everything, you’re just trying to find ways of penny pinching. If something in the building breaks we won’t fix it unless we have to.  We’ve been told there’s no more money in the pot. One of the things I find galling is that when the prime minister decides she has a policy she wants to announce, like let’s have more grammar schools, they suddenly find millions to set up new grammar schools.  Education is at a tipping point – I really do think if we do not sort out the funding problem and the recruitment crisis, then within two to three years the whole system could implode. Fantastic, dedicated classroom practitioners will just turn around and say: I’m not going to carry on doing this job any more, not for this money, not for this workload, not with this amount of stress. Sean Maher, Richard Challoner school, New Malden, Greater London  ‘No wonder teachers are leaving, they’ve had enough’  We are running on a skeleton staff. We have some classes of 34; we went up to 35 at one point because we couldn’t afford to open a new class.  We have a boy in a wheelchair who needs one-to-one support but he’s not funded for one-to-one, so I’m pulling staff from other classes who should be supporting other children. We haven’t got enough staff.  You end up with a teacher with 34 children in a class, with many with special needs and medical problems, and you don’t get medical support [which used to pay for a member of staff to be specially trained] any more. We have a child with diabetes who keeps passing out; we don’t get any medical funding to support her. No wonder teachers are leaving; they’ve had enough.  Over the last two to three years I’ve been really prudent with the budget, but next year we’ll start going into deficit.  We don’t use teachers for supply any more; we use higher level teaching assistants. We used to have a capital budget [which pays for improvements to the school premises] that was quite large; now it’s £6,000. I’ve had to apply to the local authority to have my roof replaced and I’ve got to provide the first £15,000. I’ve got to find the money somehow. That means next year I won’t be able to spend anything on my curriculum budgets – literacy resources, numeracy resources, IT spending and so on.  Some schools have a dedicated family liaison person, but none of the schools in Cambridgeshire does because we just can’t afford it. I’m sitting here counselling the same parents week on week, having massive arguments with them about attendance, because I’m going to be judged on attendance. I’m constantly referring cases to social services – who say it doesn’t meet the threshold. Primary head, Cambridgeshire  Helen Longton Howorth, headteacher, Brighton: ‘You’re having a conversation with teachers about whether to buy a set of Pritt Sticks. It’s ridiculous.’  ‘I worry about asking parents for money’  In Brighton we’ve got a peculiar situation where in the city centre, schools – the more middle-class schools – are full, but on the outskirts our funding problem is that we’re not full. I’ve got 100 or so places that I can’t fill. You get £3,000 per child, so you’re looking at £300,000 I’m already down on my budget before you’re even thinking about funding cuts.  We’re only not in deficit because I have a good business manager and we’re spending absolutely no money. We don’t hire supply teachers, we have one person who is in-house supply. If anybody is off sick we tend to split classes or use learning mentors to cover because we can’t afford supply teachers. Heaven forbid if anybody goes long-term sick leave because that would tip the budget into the red. It’s a massive worry.  I’m spending a lot of time thinking creatively about how to make money. We are having to make ourselves into marketable commodities – we’re thinking all the time about how to creatively raise funds, divert funds or not spend funds. Our PTA and fundraising events are funding our equipment. All the computers are funded through the PTA.  At Christmas, the children all made decorations in class and sold them to parents. We filmed the school play ourselves, spent the weekend burning many, many DVDs, sold them cheaply to parents, and we made £600 from things like that. That went to pay for resources to use in lessons. You worry about the fact that, for example, we charge parents £1 a ticket to come and watch the children’s play.  It’s come to the point that you’re having a conversation with teachers about whether they can afford to buy a set of Pritt Sticks before the end of the financial year – that’s quite ridiculous.

f92d4814	R io 2016 is officially Great Britain's best overseas Olympics after they surpassed the Beijing tally of 47 medals with five days of action still to go.  Boxer Josh Buatsi's bronze took Britain to 48 medals as they surpassed the previous best tally in Beijing eight years ago, and they had 50 in the bag by the end of play on Tuesday.  Moments after Buatsi's medal was confirmed, cyclist Jason Kenny triumphed in the men's Keirin to take Team GB's tally of gold medals to 19 in Rio - the same amount won in Beijing.  It was a golden day for Kenny and his fiancee Laura Trott, with the engaged couple's gold medal tally into double figures - with the pair now able to boast 10 between them.  Great Britain's Olympic gold rush - who's won what in Rio so far?  Trott became the first British woman to claim four Olympic gold medals with her win in the Omnium, while Kenny equalled the British record haul of Sir Chris Hoy after winning his sixth Olympic gold by scooping the top title in the keirin.  There is still a lot of work to do to equal the London 2012 tally of 65 medals, 29 of which were gold, but plenty of chances remain.  Trott cried on the sidelines as Kenny pedalled his victory lap with his arms in the air, before the couple embraced and kissed as the crowd cheered.  Speaking to the BBC following his win, Kenny said:  Today just felt like a dream really, I think I'm just kind of so tired I'm just floating through it. So yeah, I really enjoyed today.

664308f8	Plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds are to be banned in England from April next year in a move campaigners have welcomed but warned will “only scratch the surface” in tackling the damage that non-degradable waste is doing to the environment.  The environment secretary Michael Gove confirmed the ban on the supply of the items after an open consultation revealed “overwhelming” public support for the move.  The ban will include exemptions to ensure that those with medical needs or a disability are able to continue to access plastic straws, the government said.  Mr Gove said: “Urgent and decisive action is needed to tackle plastic pollution and protect our environment. These items are often used for just a few minutes but take hundreds of years to break down, ending up in our seas and oceans and harming precious marine life.  “So today I am taking action to turn the tide on plastic pollution, and ensure we leave our environment in a better state for future generations.”  Senegal's plastic waste crisis Show all 10 1 /10 Senegal's plastic waste crisis Senegal's plastic waste crisis Senegalese boys play on a section of beach that has been eroded away by a big storm revealing layers of waste in the beach sand in the fishing village Yenne Todd in Senegal, 24 February 2019.

EPA-EFE  In England, it is estimated we use 4.7 billion plastic straws, 316 million plastic stirrers and 1.8 billion plastic-stemmed cotton buds a year, according to government figures.  An estimated 10 per cent of cotton buds are flushed down toilets and can end up in waterways and oceans.  weekly exclusive email The Independent Climate Newsletter Get our Free Climate Newsletter Sign up for news and advice on saving the planet Email Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address sign up I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our privacy notice Thanks for signing up to the  Climate newsletter  The consultation revealed 80 per cent of respondents backed a ban on the distribution and sale of plastic straws, 90 per cent backed a ban on drinks stirrers, and 89 percent supported a ban on cotton buds.  Paper straws and cotton buds with paper stems are already widely available.  It is estimated there is over 150 million tonnes of plastic waste polluting the world’s oceans and every year around a million birds and over 100,000 sea mammals die from eating and getting tangled in plastic waste.  A recent report estimates the quantity of plastic in the sea will treble by 2025.  The ban on straws, stirrers and cotton buds is the latest policy announced by the UK government to crackdown on plastic.  The plastic microbeads ban came into force last year, and the 5p plastic bag charge was introduced in 2015 – which the government says has led to nine billion fewer bags distributed.  Sam Chetan-Welsh, political campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “It’s been a long time coming, but we welcome the news that DEFRA are finally enforcing a ban on throwaway plastics like straws, cotton buds and stirrers. The reality is though that these bans only scratch the surface.  “To really tackle the plastic crisis we need bigger bolder action from this government – including targets to radically reduce the production of single-use plastics and an all-inclusive deposit return scheme for drinks containers.”  Laura Foster, from the Marine Conservation Society, said: “We are delighted with this government decision which will help consumers move to a more plastic-free lifestyle.  ✕ Support free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events  “Surveys last year during our Great British Beach Clean showed, for instance, that cotton buds were in the Top 10 items found by volunteers – with an average 17 found per every 100 metres of beach in England. It’s right that plastic cotton buds should be banned.  “While we strongly welcome today’s announcement, we now need Michael Gove to go further in moving to reduce plastic consumption overall and increase recycling rates, particularly with a fully inclusive deposit return scheme for bottles and glass.  “It’s clear that the public mood has changed and what we need to see now is further action by retailers and the government to encourage a move against all single use plastic and to improve recycling.”  Lauren West, from Muscular Dystrophy UK, said: “Plastic straws are sometimes the only type of straw that work for disabled people due to their flexibility and ability to be used in hot and cold drinks.  “We’re pleased the government has recognised this in its proposals put forward today.”	Plastic straws and cotton buds to be banned next year in effort to tackle plastic pollution	false
58985a7d	Families' venting fury at needless tragedies as overworked staff fail sick and elderly who are being 'forgotten to death' Exclusive      Shaun Wooller      8 Jan 2017, 23:11Updated: 10 Jan 2017, 8:20  AT LEAST two Brits a day are dying of thirst or starvation in our ­hospitals and care homes.  The appalling statistic heaped pressure on Health Secretary ­Jeremy Hunt to come to the aid of the crisis-ravaged NHS. Out of sight ... patients are being “forgotten to death” in a social care scandal that sparked nationwide fury last night 10 Out of sight ... patients are being “forgotten to death” in a social care scandal that sparked nationwide fury last nightCredit: Alamy  Age UK last night  described the situation as “horrifying”.  Critics blame the back-breaking workloads piled on NHS staff, many of whom lack the time to help patients eat and drink.  Pressure groups also point to the poor quality of the food served up.  Malnutrition was mentioned on the death certificates of 297 patients who died in hospital during 2015, while dehydration was cited on 429.  For care homes, the figures were 54 and 76 respectively.  Many of the patients will have been unable to hold cups or cutlery, others may have forgotten they need to eat.  In 47 of the dehydration cases and 66 of the malnutrition incidents, that was identified as the main cause of death. Hunger and thirst were a factor in the remaining 743.

Ian Mack, whose dad died from dehydration in hospital in 2008, said: “He was absolutely forgotten to death.”  Patient Concern’s Joyce Robins, said last night: “Every one of these deaths is a tragedy.  “Hospital wards are full and staff are run off their feet looking after so many patients it is impossible to give them the care they need.  “Patients will need help eating or drinking but are being neglected.”  The figures, from the Office of National Statistics, come after the British Red Cross warned of a “humanitarian crisis” in the NHS.  And Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said on Friday: “The emergency care system is on its knees, despite the huge efforts of staff.”  Overwhelmed casualty units are failing to meet key performance targets and are turning ambulances away.  The government has slashed spending on social care, swamped doctors and nurses are dealing with record numbers of patients and care homes are struggling to recruit staff. Grief ...

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has previously spoken of his devastation after hearing how a 100-year-old patient died of dehydrationCredit: PA:Press Association  Inspections revealed 312 care homes were failing to adequately feed and hydrate residents between January 2015 and November 2016.  That accounts for one in 50 care homes, looking after 11,500 people.  Data also shows millions of patient meals are thrown away every day.  Caroline Abrahams, from Age UK said: “It’s horrifying to think that older people are dying because they haven’t had enough to eat or drink in care homes and hospitals.  “If malnutrition is left untreated it has serious consequences, as these new figures show.” Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has previously spoken of his devastation after hearing how a 100-year-old patient died of dehydration.  Great-grandmother Lydia Spilner died at Leicester Royal Infirmary in February 2012 after her daughter’s pleas for a drip were ignored.  University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust admitted Lydia died of kidney failure caused by dehydration and paid her family an undisclosed sum.  Mr Hunt said at the time: “That story is devastating. There are still too many places where the patient is not foremost in the considerations.”  The NHS Litigation Authority said £311,750 has been paid in compensation to patients and their families in the last five years after they claimed poor care caused malnutrition.

This may mean sitting with them to help them eat and drink.  “The government has an important role in making sure the funding is in place to support good quality care. Our worry is these figures are another sign that our system for caring for older people is failing.” Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb said: “It is frankly a national scandal people are dying due to thirst and hunger. Staff are overworked and patients are at risk.  “Anyone who has been in hospital also knows how poor the food is. We need to fix it.  “People are not expecting the Ritz but it needs to be edible.  “How can we live in a country that cannot give people water who are sick? It’s outrageous.  “Theresa May is in denial about the extent of the crisis facing the NHS.  “The reality is chronic underfunding by her government is running our NHS into the ground.” Under pressure ... The government has slashed spending on social care, swamped doctors and nurses are dealing with record numbers of patients 10 Under pressure ... The government has slashed spending on social care, swamped doctors and nurses are dealing with record numbers of patientsCredit: Getty Images  Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said: “These are deeply saddening figures that paint a picture of the strain the government has put on the NHS. The funding gap and strain on hospitals and care homes has reached a critical point.  “The Prime Minister needs to wake up to this crisis, bring forward the planned £700million of social care funding and pledge a new funding settlement for the NHS and social care at the Budget.”  The 856 mentions represent a small rise from 833 in 2014 but are down from more than 1,000 a year across the preceding decade.  The controversial Liverpool Care Pathway — in which patient deaths were hastened by the withdrawal of food and water — was phased out from 2013.  Patients were often placed on the pathway without relatives being informed. Hospitals also received a cash incentive for each patient on it.  The guidelines that replaced the LCP say the dying person should be checked for dehydration at least daily and supported to drink, should they wish, or provided with medically assisted hydration.

The PM admitted there are “huge pressures” on hospitals and GP surgeries at the moment but added: “I don’t accept the description the Red Cross has made of this.” She also rejected calls for another emergency bailout of the health service.    Basic care neglected Stanley Mack, 77, died from dehydration after being admitted to Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham 10 Stanley Mack, 77, died from dehydration after being admitted to Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham  AN inquest in 2013 heard that Stanley Mack, 77, died from dehydration after being admitted to Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham in July 2008.  The former Rover worker had initially been admitted with a chest infection and was later diagnosed with the superbug C.diff.  His son Ian said: “It was the hospital’s job to get the basics right and very clearly they failed. He was absolutely forgotten to death.”  Stanley’s widow Carol said: “He would be given drinks and occasionally they would be written up as given to him, but we knew he was not drinking it.”    Residents' choke risk Windsor Care Home, in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, failed to safely manage residents’ hydration and nutrition 10 Windsor Care Home, in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, failed to safely manage residents’ hydration and nutrition  A CARE home left residents at risk of choking on food and without adequate access to drinks, an inspection found.  The Care Quality Commission said Windsor Care Home, in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, failed to safely manage residents’ hydration and nutrition.  Inspectors saw a resident choke after they were given the wrong texture food.  Poorly recorded food and fluid charts were also noted.  The report says: “There were no target amounts set out in care plans so it was not possible to know whether each person had the right daily amount of fluid.”  The home was branded inadequate last week.  	kill by mouth NHS hospitals plunged into crisis as up to two patients die each DAY of thirst or starvation	partially false
87a297a2	The NHS Long Term Plan, published today, will save almost half a million more lives with practical action on major killer conditions and investment in world class, cutting edge treatments including genomic tests for every child with cancer.  The blueprint to make the NHS fit for the future will use the latest technology, such as digital GP consultations for all those who want them, coupled with early detection and a renewed focus on prevention to stop an estimated 85,000 premature deaths each year.  Measures outlined by NHS leaders today will help prevent 150,000 heart attacks, strokes and dementia cases while more than three million people will benefit from new and improved stroke, respiratory and cardiac services over the next decade.  Patients will benefit from services ranging from improved neonatal care for new parents and babies to life-changing stroke therapy and integrated support to keep older people out of hospital, living longer and more independent lives.  The NHS Long Term Plan is also the first time in the NHS’ 70 year history when there will be a new guarantee that investment in primary, community and mental health care will grow faster than the growing overall NHS budget. This will fund a £4.5 billion new service model for the 21st century across England, where health bodies come together to provide better, joined up care in partnership with local government.  The commitment to tackle major physical conditions comes alongside the biggest ever investment in mental health services rising to at least £2.3 billion a year by 2023/24. Building on significant expansion in recent years, the long term plan will see around two million more people who suffer anxiety, depression or other problems receive help over the next decade including new dads as well as mums, and 24 hour access to crisis care via NHS 111.  The NHS Long Term Plan will also:  Open a digital ‘front door’ to the health service, allowing patients to be able to access health care at the touch of a button  Provide genetic testing for a quarter of people with dangerously high inherited cholesterol, reaching around 30,000 people  Give mental health help to 345,000 more children and young people through the expansion of community based services, including in schools  Use cutting edge scans and technology, including the potential use of artificial intelligence, to help provide the best stroke care in Europe with over 100,000 more people each year accessing new, better services  Invest in earlier detection and better treatment of respiratory conditions to prevent 80,000 hospital admissions and smart inhalers will be piloted so patients can easily monitor their condition, regardless of where they are  Ensure every hospital with a major A&E department has ‘same day emergency care’ in place so that patients can be treated and discharged with the right package of support, without needing an overnight stay.  NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: “The NHS has been marking its 70th anniversary, and the national debate has rightly centred on three big truths. There’s been pride in our health service’s enduring success, and in the shared social commitment it represents. There’s been concern – about funding, staffing, increasing inequalities and pressures from a growing and ageing population. And there’s also been legitimate optimism – about the possibilities for continuing medical advance and better outcomes of care.  “In looking ahead to the Health Service’s 80th birthday, this NHS Long Term Plan acts on all three of these realities. It keeps all that’s good about our health service and its place in our national life. It tackles head-on the pressures our staff face. And it sets a practical, costed, phased route map for the NHS’s priorities for care quality and outcomes improvement for the decade ahead.”  Seventy years after the NHS was founded, the health service will expand care for patients and their families at every stage of life, supporting people to start well, live well and age well.  The NHS will be the first health service in the world to offer whole genome sequencing for children with cancer and young people who have a rare genetic disorder, in addition to adults suffering from certain rare conditions or specific cancers.  The new, individually tailored treatments will be introduced alongside cutting edge testing services that will mean three quarters of cancer patients are diagnosed early, when the condition is easier to treat, up from half at present, saving 55,000 lives a year.  Around 23,000 premature deaths and 50,000 hospital admissions will be prevented over the next decade by putting over 100,000 patients with heart problems through a healthy living and exercise programme every year.  Children and young people’s health will be a priority with the introduction of a new transformation programme to oversee delivery of commitments for the next ten years, from bringing mental and physical care together to services for 0-25 years so that care is timely and continuous.  A renewed focus on prevention including action to help people live healthier lives will stop thousands of people developing life threatening or limiting conditions, including the expansion of the Diabetes Prevention Programme.  And as more people live longer, care will increasingly be delivered in people’s homes or somewhere convenient, freeing up space in hospitals for those who need it most.  Ian Dalton, chief executive of NHS Improvement, said: “At the heart of the NHS are hard-working staff who pull out all the stops to care for patients every day. It is thanks to their dedication that the NHS is admired around the world and that it has taken great strides over the last seven decades.  “We need to build on these achievements and make the best use of the new investment to fundamentally reset how the NHS is run so that our growing and ageing population can get the right care at the right time and in the right place.  “This means breaking down organisational barriers to take a more holistic approach to how care is delivered and paid for, embracing new and existing forms of technology, recruiting and retaining the right number of staff, and shifting the focus away from hospitals to prevention and care in the community.  “Developed by those working within the NHS, the long term plan sets out an exciting roadmap for how we will do this together for the benefit of patients.”  Professor Carrie MacEwen, chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges said: “It’s good to have a plan which sets a clear direction for the NHS and tackles many of the issues the Academy has long been saying need to be addressed if we are to improve patient care. Our challenge now is to make sure it’s properly implemented and in this regard we, that is everyone who works in the NHS and patients who use the service, must all play our part if we are to make it a success.”  Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation said: “This plan is a welcome and significant step in the fight against heart and circulatory diseases, which promises to save thousands of lives in the coming years.  “The plan’s strong focus on improving prevention and detection of heart and circulatory diseases and their risk factors has the potential to make a huge difference, ensuring that deaths rates fall further in the future. In addition, better care and support for people living with heart failure will significantly improve quality of life for many.  “It’s now essential that work gets underway on making this transformational plan a reality.”  Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind, said: “We are really pleased to see that mental health is such a key focus in the NHS long term plan and we welcome the £2.3bn set aside for mental health services. This is the kind of sustained investment we need to see to put mental health on an equal footing with physical health and, if delivered, this plan will make a difference to the lives of thousands of people with mental health problems.  “Everyone now needs to work together to develop the workforce needed and to deliver these plans and to ensure the money reaches the frontline. Local decision makers need to develop their own plans and the proof of delivery will be in the experiences of people trying to access the services they need.”  Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan, said:  “It’s been a privilege to work with NHSE shaping the cancer section of the long term plan. I’m delighted that cancer has continued to remain a high priority. One in two people will get a cancer diagnosis during their lifetime and the plan lays out important milestones around improving survival and ensuring high quality personalised care for every patient. I look forward to continuing to work with the NHS to meet these milestones and to improve cancer care for patients now and in the future.”	NHS Long Term Plan to tackle major killer conditions and save up to half a million lives	other
66e01970	A Liberal Democrat MP has tabled a parliamentary bill that would make it a criminal offence to take a photo up a person’s skirt without their permission.  Wera Hobhouse introduced the bill after discovering “upskirting” is not illegal because there is no specific crime covering the act.  As a result, police have often been unable to charge people found to be taking inappropriate photos of women without their permission.  Ms Hobhouse’s bill would amend the Sexual Offences Act 2003 to add upskirting as an offence under a section on voyeurism.  The proposals would see anyone convicted of the crime given a fine or a jail term of up to two years.  The Bath MP is due to meet with government ministers to discuss the bill, which she hopes will be passed with cross-party support.  Upskirting was made illegal in Scotland in 2009 but equivalent legislation has not been passed in England and Wales. Ms Hobhouse’s proposed law is based on the Scottish version.

Read our privacy notice  While some people have been charged for committing the act under laws relating to public decency, this relies on the incident taking place in a public place or being witnessed by others – a factor campaigners say is irrelevant to the inappropriate nature the act.  Speaking to The Independent, Ms Hobhouse said: “It’s a very vile practice – it’s humiliating, it’s degrading, it doesn’t fit with what we as women expect to encounter in the 21st Century.  “It’s discriminating and disgusting and there’s a very simple change that would make it a criminal offence.”  She added: “It’s never happened to me, luckily, but I know how embarrassed and awful I would feel if somebody had done that to me.  “It makes you immediately sympathise and think ‘this should absolutely be stopped’.”  International Women’s Day: groundbreaking figures from history Show all 17 1 /17 International Women’s Day: groundbreaking figures from history International Women’s Day: groundbreaking figures from history Radical political activist Angela Davis speaks at a protest in Raleigh Getty International Women’s Day: groundbreaking figures from history Poor pay, 14 hour days and dangerous working conditions led to a strike by around 1400 women and girls at a match factory in Bow, London, 1888.

She said: “We’re doing this in advance of International Women’s Day because we think everybody should do something on that day, not just say ‘Oh we’ve achieved a great deal but we need to achieve more’. Let’s do one little thing that will make a difference.  “I think this has the potential to make a difference.

Before then the MP is due to lobby Victoria Atkins, the minister for women, who asked to meet her to discuss the issue.  It follows a petition set up by Gina Martin, 25, who was the victim of upskirting at a music festival last summer but was told by police that the culprit could not be charged because the offence was not technically a crime.  Ms Martin said: “I am delighted that Wera Hobhouse and her colleagues in the Liberal Democrats have decided to support my campaign to introduce a specific upskirting offence.  “During her work on this bill with my lawyer Ryan Whelan, at Gibson Dunn, I have seen first-hand just how much Wera wants to get this right, how much she, like me, wants to ensure that upskirters can be prosecuted appropriately in all circumstances.  “I believe this bill achieves that and I look forward to other politicians from across the political divide joining Wera, Ryan and I in working to implore [Justice Secretary] David Gauke – and others in government – to close this gap in the law.”  The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners has previously said a new law is needed to make upskirting a sexual offence.  Vera Baird QC, the organisation’s lead on matters relating to victims, said the current law “is far from clear” because there is “no specific offence relating to the taking of pictures for sexual gratification without the victim’s knowledge or consent”.

8c7cfe8f	One in ten patients admitted to hospital are suffering from a form of diabetes linked to being overweight and inactive.  The scale of the growing crisis was laid bare last night as it was revealed hospitals are being deluged with 5,000 type 2 diabetes patients every day.  It is taking an unprecedented toll on the under-pressure NHS, with doctors now seeing children aged under nine who need help.  The reason the illness is so burdensome for the NHS is its devastating complications, which include heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure and amputations. The figures show there were 4,992 admissions for women aged 20 to 29 in 2018/19, compared with 1,755 for men [File photo]  GP leaders also warned that some patients need up to 200 health appointments a year to deal with their condition.  There were more than 1.7million admissions of patients with type 2 diabetes last year, costing the NHS an estimated £22million a day.  An admission can count the same patient more than once.  The figure has doubled in a decade and last night the head of the NHS warned: ‘Our ever-expanding waistlines are taking a growing toll.’  Simon Stevens warned the ‘alarming rise’ in admissions across the board was putting ‘avoidable pressure’ on our hospitals.  The figures also reveal there were 940 admissions involving children and teenagers aged 19 and under in 2018/19. This included 45 admissions for children aged nine or under – a shocking statistic for an illness once only seen in middle-aged adults [File photo]  The illness appears to be having a worrying impact on younger women, according to the latest data from NHS Digital.  Two thirds of the type 2 diabetes admissions for the under-40s last year involved female patients and there is evidence they are more susceptible to complications.  The data only covers those patients with type 2 diabetes, which is strongly linked to being overweight and inactive – and largely preventable.  The reason the illness is so burdensome for the NHS is its devastating complications, which include heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure and amputations.  The figures show there were 4,992 admissions for women aged 20 to 29 in 2018/19, compared with 1,755 for men.  GP leaders also warned that some patients need up to 200 health appointments a year to deal with their condition. There were more than 1.7million admissions of patients with type 2 diabetes last year [File photo]  Similarly, there were 16,707 admissions for women aged 30 to 39 compared with 10,207 for men. Overall women accounted for 65 per cent of the 34,601 admissions among the under-40s last year.  Although type 2 diabetes is more common in men, research has shown women are more at risk of complications arising from it including heart disease, kidney disease as well as depression.  Disturbingly, the figures also reveal there were 940 admissions involving children and teenagers aged 19 and under in 2018/19. This included 45 admissions for children aged nine or under – a shocking statistic for an illness once only seen in middle-aged adults.  Regardless of their age or sex, most patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes will need to take medication and attend regular check-ups for the rest of their lives.  Mr Stevens, chief executive of the NHS, said: ‘Our ever-expanding waistlines are taking a growing toll on our families’ health and on our NHS, with this alarming rise in admissions demonstrating the avoidable pressure it is putting on hospitals.  ‘The NHS Long Term Plan is more than playing its part, with plans to prevent 200,000 people a year from developing type 2 diabetes, but wider society including supermarkets and retailers need to step up in the battle against the bulge.’  Caroline Cerny of the Obesity Health Alliance, a coalition of 40 organisations which are aiming to reduce obesity levels, said: ‘Obesity significantly increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and that’s why we need the Government to take strong action to protect children’s health, with comprehensive restrictions to curb the relentless marketing and promotion of junk food.’  One in ten patients admitted to hospital are suffering from a form of diabetes linked to being overweight and inactive. The scale of the crisis was laid bare last night as it was revealed hospitals are being deluged with 5,000 type 2 diabetes patients every day [File photo]  An estimated 4.7million adults and children in Britain are living with diabetes, and the majority have type 2. This number has doubled since 1998, in line with rising obesity levels and the condition is believed to cost the NHS £14billion annually.  To gauge the impact of the illness on hospitals, the Mail analysed admission data from NHS Digital for the last ten years.  This revealed there were 1,749,025 admissions for type 2 diabetes in 2018/19, up from 1,637,565 in 2017/18 and 924,536 in 2009/10. An admission could include a planned check-up for diabetes as well as one for a complication – or an emergency admission via A&E.  After the age of 40, men catch up with women and go on to account for a higher proportion of admissions for patients aged 50 to 90.  This is probably because men are more likely to get type 2 diabetes and the illness most commonly develops in the over 50s. However, previous studies have suggested women with type 2 diabetes are more susceptible to heart disease and strokes.  The diabetics who use NHS 200 times a year  By Sophie Borland, Health Editor for the Daily Mail  Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard above said adults in the ‘later stages’ of the condition required daily consultations or home visits  Diabetes is putting a huge strain on GP surgeries with patients needing up to 200 NHS appointments a year, a top doctor has revealed.  Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard said adults in the ‘later stages’ of the condition required daily consultations or home visits.  She said the ‘steady increase’ in the number of new cases was creating ‘significant problems’ for surgeries, which are already under intense pressure. The head of the Royal College of GPs also revealed how patients are developing symptoms 20 years earlier in life than compared to when she first qualified in the early 2000s.  Professor Stokes-Lampard, who represents 52,000 GPs in the UK, said: ‘Every person who is diagnosed is going to need several appointments with their GP, several appointments with the practice sister, education, lifestyle, then the optician, and chiropodist foot specialist.  ‘In your first year of diabetes you’ve probably got eight to ten health-related appointments, assuming everything goes to plan. Then you’re going to need monitoring for the rest of your life with blood tests, you’ll probably need medication for the rest of your life.  ‘If you have complications however – a patient whose control hasn’t been good, is in the later stages, could need to be seen in the surgery daily.  ‘You could have 200 appointments a year or a district nurse who is calling to your house daily. This is at the extreme end of the spectrum.’  Diabetes is putting a huge strain on GP surgeries with patients needing up to 200 NHS appointments a year, a top doctor has revealed. GPs are trying to encourage overweight patients to slim down to reduce the rates of diabetes and other health conditions [File photo]  GP surgeries are under intense strain as growing numbers of doctors are taking early retirement or cutting back on their hours, without being replaced.  This is at a time when demand for appointments is going up due to the aging population and the increasing prevalence of lifestyle-related illnesses such as diabetes.  GPs are trying to encourage overweight patients to slim down to reduce the rates of diabetes and other health conditions.  But Professor Stokes-Lampard, who practises in Lichfield, Staffordshire, said one of the hardest parts of her job was telling parents their children were too fat and needed to go on a diet.  She said: ‘If I see a very overweight parent bringing in a child who is heading to the overweight category it’s a difficult conversation to have.  ‘You ask the question have you noticed they’ve gained weight since started going to school, how do you get on with healthy eating at home, you steer the conversation in different ways to work out the reaction and see what motivates them.  ‘Sometimes when people really, really don’t seem to be getting the message you have to have a more direct conversation.’  Although Type 2 diabetes is closely linked to obesity, certain groups are at much higher risk including people of South Asians origin or those with a family history.  Professor Stokes-Lampard said that some patients were so ashamed of having an illness ‘of fat people’ that they refused to take any medication.

6f2dd3a8	New research reveals that Labour’s reckless spending plans could hand an additional £2,400 bill to every taxpayer every year if Jeremy Corbyn becomes Prime Minister. This figure - the ‘Cost of Corbyn’ - is equivalent to an entire month’s pay for the average earner.  Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour would wrack up a spending bill of an extra £1.2 trillion over the next Parliament. This includes £546 billion of capital expenditure – which their Fiscal Rule would allow them to borrow for. The remaining resource spending of £651 billion would need to be funded through tax measures.  Analysis of Labour’s spending plans shows that there is a £374 billion black hole in their numbers – with only £277 billion of their £651 billion of resource spending covered by taxes under their current plans. Labour will have to put up taxes to cover the shortfall.‍  ‍  The taxes that Corbyn’s Labour are considering bringing in include:    A homes tax.  ‍A movers’ tax.  A gifts tax.  Fuel duty hikes and increased holiday taxes.  ‍  Commenting, Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid said:    “Jeremy Corbyn is planning a reckless spending spree which we will all have to pay for. He will open up a huge black hole in the nation’s finances and hard working people will be the ones that suffer. In order to pay for his policies, he will not only have to massively increase borrowing and debt, he will also need to hike up taxes by £2,400 per person – this is equivalent to an entire month’s pay for the average earner.  “The British people have made huge progress over the last decade in repairing the damage left to us by the last Labour Government. If Jeremy Corbyn gets into power he would throw all that hard work away.  “A vote for Corbyn’s Labour is a vote for higher taxes and the chaos of two more referendums. Only a sensible, majority Conservative Government will get Brexit done and provide the economic certainty that families and businesses need to plan for the future. We simply cannot afford the cost of Corbyn.”    ‍  What you need to know:  John McDonnell has ruled out borrowing to fund for Labour’s day-to-day spending plans.  ‍‘Labour’s Fiscal Credibility Rule does not allow for borrowing for day to day spending. Under our rule, drafted by leading economists, only borrowing for long term investment is allowed.’ John McDonnell, Twitter, 6 January 2019, link  Labour’s day-to-day black hole means that each individual taxpayer in the UK could see their income tax rise by £2,400 a year.  ‍By their own fiscal rules, Labour are not allowed to borrow to fund the £650 billion of day-to-day spending commitments they have made, and would instead need to raise taxes. They have committed to £277 billion in revenue raisers, meaning they have a gap to fill of £374 billion. There are 31,199,000 income taxpayers in the UK, who would each need to pay an extra £12,000 over five years, or £2,400 a year, to cover Labour’s this gap every year HMRC, Number of income taxpayers, 28 June 2019, link.  The average person would have to work an extra 30 days to pay off this increase.  ‍The median weekly wage is £479 – or £394 after tax under current plans. This is equal to around £78.80 a day, so £2,400 is equivalent to 30 days of work. This is based on 30 calendar days including weekends, so in reality it would take more than six weeks of working Monday to Friday to pay off ONS, ASHE Table 1, 29 October 2019, link.  Families will be around £20,000 worse off over the course of a five-year Parliament.  ‍Labour’s resource black hole, divided by the 19.1 million families in the UK, would see each family liable for £19,598.70 over five years ONS, Families and households, 7 August 2019, link.‍  That means families will have to pay an additional £3,900 in tax every year to cover the £374 billion black hole in Labour’s resource spending plans. This is equivalent to each family across the country paying £75 a week more in tax.  This can be averaged across the regions, as shown in the table at the link HMRC, Number of income taxpayers, 28 June 2019, link; ONS, Country and regional public sector finances revenue tables, 28 May 2019, link.  ‍  Calculating Labour’s blackhole:‍  Labour have committed to spending £1.2 trillion over the next five years.  Of this total, Labour have made £651 billion worth of spending commitments that are considered day-to-day spending and therefore cannot be borrowed for The Telegraph, 10 November 2019, link; The Conservative Party, The Real Cost of a Labour Government, 10 November 2019, available upon request.‍  Labour said their 2017 manifesto would raise £48.6 billion a year, or £243 billion over a Parliament. However, part of this includes revenue from introducing VAT on private schools, which, due to a motion passing a Labour conference, it is now party policy to abolish. Giving Labour the benefit of the doubt, we have assumed this would not happen in year one, so have included revenue of £1.6 billion for the first year from this The Labour Party, Funding Britain’s Future, May 2017, link.  ‍Since 2017, Labour have committed to introducing further revenue raisers worth £40.5. billion over five years CRD analysis, 10 November 2019, available upon request.‍  Even taking revenue raisers into account, Labour are facing a blackhole of more than £370 billion on their day-to-day spending. They have committed to £651 billion of day-to-day spending, but have only announced revenue raisers worth £277 billion over a five-year Parliament – leaving a blackhole of £374 billion CRD analysis, 10 November 2019, available upon request.‍  ‍  That’s why Labour will need to consider more taxes to fill the gap:‍  A homes tax.  ‍A Labour policy document called for a new ‘progressive property tax’, which would see the average household pay up to £375 more on property tax than under the current Council Tax system. This is expected to raise an additional £10.2 billion across England compared to the current Council Tax system Labour Party, Land for the Many, p.33, June 2019, link; Resolution Foundation, Options for reforming property taxation, March 2018, link; alongside analysis of Land Registry, UK House price index summary, March 2019, and MHCLG, Live Tables on Council Tax, March 2019  A movers’ tax.  ‍A Labour Party policy document states: ‘Applying a capital gains tax to main residences too would allow us to limit the wealth inequality arising from the housing boom’. Scrapping the Capital Gains Tax exemption on main homes would force owners to pay income tax on the profits when they move home – and lead to a ‘double whammy’ levy on their estates when the owners die. Such a tax could raise £28 billion a year The Labour Party, Land for the Many, p. 34, June 2019, link.  A gifts tax.  ‍This would mean a huge tax hike for most people who inherit the family home their parents. Labour’s proposal is for a new ‘lifetime gifts tax’ on cash or homes given to individuals during the course of their lives. This is expected to raise an additional £9.2 billion a year The Labour Party, Land for the Many, June 2019, link.  ‍Fuel duty hikes and increased holiday taxes.  ‍Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald has said: ‘Fuel duty, frozen since 2010 … Air passenger duty in aviation, broadly frozen over a similar period … This is not a sensible approach to transport policy’.  ‍Increasing fuel duty is expected to raise up to £855 million a year; raising Air Passenger Duty could raise £300 million a year Andy McDonald speech to the Institute for Government, 20 March 2019, archived; HMT, Budget 2018, 29 October 2018, link; Hansard, 10 July 2018, link.    ‍  But even all of these taxes combined wouldn’t plug the hole, leaving Labour with nowhere left to turn except increasing income tax on hardworking people…  ‍  Over five years, these proposed taxes would raise £242.8 billion – leaving more than £131 billion still to fund.  ‍These taxes would raise around £48.6 billion annually, or £242.8 billion over five years. There is still a black hole of £131.6 billion – or £26.3 billion annually – that Labour would need to fill.‍  Jeremy Corbyn has already suggested he could put up income tax.  ‍He said: ‘We have to talk about tax.

2e48fffe	Of the 113 successful applicants appointed Queen’s Counsel today 12 January 2017, 31 were women up from 25 last year, and 16 were of a BAME background up from 9. In addition, distinguished academics are among the 5 new Honorary Queen’s Counsel also appointed today.  The news has been welcomed by the Lord Chancellor, Elizabeth Truss, who is working closely with the legal industry to break down barriers and improve promotion of talent across the board, from law firms to Supreme Court judges.  Lord Chancellor Elizabeth Truss said:  I commend each of the 113 barristers and solicitors, alongside the five Honorary Queen’s Counsel, for their appointments. I want us to tap into all the talents of our society and today’s appointments are a step in the right direction. The number of women and BAME candidates applying and being successful is moving in the right direction. There is more to be done, but my message is clear - when you widen the pool of talent from which lawyers and judges are drawn, you make the justice system stronger.  Today the Judicial Appointments Commission also launches the latest recruitment exercise for High Court judges. The selection process has been changed so the wider merits of all candidates are recognised. For the first time, it opens the door to a wider pool of ‘direct-entry candidates’ – individuals who while exceptionally talented have not had previous judicial experience.  Notes to editors  The list of 2016 to 2017 Queen’s Counsel appointments The 113 Queen’s Counsel QC also known as silks appointments includes: - 31 women applicants of the 56 who applied; last year, 25 of the 48 female applicants were successful - 16 applicants who declared an ethnic origin other than white of the 37 who applied; last year, 9 such applicants out of 32 were appointed QCs are appointed by The Queen, on the advice of the Lord Chancellor. She is in turn advised by an independent Selection Panel which receives and considers each application and makes recommendations as to appointment. The Lord Chancellor will preside over the appointment ceremony, where the rank will formally be bestowed upon successful applicants, at Westminster Hall on 13 February 2017.

22b5eb59	Nearly 99 per cent of Covid-19 patients who are vitamin D deficient die, according to a terrifying study that adds to mounting evidence that the 'sunshine' nutrient could be a coronavirus life-saver.  Indonesian researchers analysed hospital records of 780 people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.  Results revealed 98.9 per cent of infected patients defined as vitamin D deficient — below 20ng/ml — died. Yet this fell to just 4.1 per cent for patients who had enough of the nutrient.  Researchers warned the study was not definitive, however, because the patients with high vitamin D levels were healthier and younger.  It comes as health chiefs are urgently reviewing the use of vitamin D as a coronavirus lifesaver, with several studies suggesting that Covid-19 patients are far more likely to die if they have a deficiency.  One investigation – carried out by Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge – found European countries with lower vitamin D levels have had significantly more pandemic casualties.  The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is conducting a 'rapid evidence review' of the issue – and publication is expected as early as next week.  A graphic, pictured, shows how the Covid-19 death rate is affected by the level of Vitamin D  The main source of vitamin D for most people is daylight - the body can make its own supply of the nutrient when the skin is exposed to UV rays stock image  Researchers at the University of East Anglia in May produced a correlation graph showing the relationship between levels of vitamin D bottom, measured in nmol/l compared to infection numbers of coronavirus. Countries with low vitamin D levels tend to have the highest case rates per million, they found  Data in a Public Health England report showed that the mortality rate - the number of people dying with the coronavirus out of each 100,000 people - was considerably higher for black men than other group. The risk for black women, people of Asian ethnicity, and mixed race people was also higher than for white people of either sex. People with non-white skin are also at a higher risk of vitamin D deficiency because it takes them longer to make it from sunlight  The Indonesian study was not associated with experts from any university, unlike most Covid-19 research.  All five researchers, led by Prabowo Raharusuna, were listed as 'independent'. No details of their scientific backgrounds were provided in the paper.  The research — published in April — has yet to be peer-reviewed by fellow scientists, a process that often uncovers flaws in studies.  The team found vitamin D-deficient patients were 10 times more likely to die when age, gender and co-morbidities were taken into account.  They wrote in the paper: 'When controlling for age, sex, and comorbidity, vitamin D status is strongly associated with Covid-19 mortality outcome of cases.'  And they called for randomised controlled trials — considered the gold-standard of scientific research — to prove whether vitamin D can be a life-saver.  One in five British adults and one in six children is lacking in vitamin D, thanks to poor diets, indoor lifestyles and lack of sunshine.  Experts estimate around 1billion people worldwide are deficient in the vitamin, with the figures having been described as a 'global public health issue'.  Some scientists fear that the lockdown and months of indoor living have cut levels even further.  Some ethnic groups tend to be at higher risk because their skin is less able to make the vitamin in response to sunlight.  Older people are also in danger because the body gets less efficient at producing the vitamin with age.  Public Health England is working with NICE on the review and has asked the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition to carry out a separate report. In other developments in the pandemic:  VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY 'COULD RAISE COVID-19 DEATH RISK' FOR BAME PEOPLE BAME people may face a higher risk of dying from the coronavirus because they are more likely to have a vitamin D deficiency, scientists claim. The pandemic is seeing higher rates of people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds dying if they catch the coronavirus. The reasons are still unknown and will likely be numerous and complicated. But some experts think a lack of vitamin D may play a role. People with darker skin need to spend more time in sunlight in order to get the same amount of vitamin D as a person with lighter skin. For this reason, the NHS suggests people with an African, African-Caribbean or south Asian background could benefit from take a daily supplement throughout the year. Vitamin D may have a protective effect against severe coronavirus by regulating the immune system, and deficiencies of it have been linked to other respiratory viruses. However, the largest study to investigate the link between BAME, Covid-19 and vitamin D in a UK population found no proof. William Henley, a professor of medical statistics at University of Exeter, told MailOnline the link is worth exploring. He said: 'Preliminary research suggests vitamin D levels may also impact on the risk of people suffering from severe COVID-19 infections. 'In the UK and northern European latitudes, vitamin D deficiency is a public health concern because ultraviolet B UVB radiation is of insufficient intensity for vitamin D synthesis during winter months. 'This is a particular concern for people with dark skin, such as those of African, African-Caribbean or south Asian origin, who will need to spend longer in the sun to produce the same amount of vitamin D as someone with lighter skin.'

Vitamin D tablets are extremely cheap – they cost as little as 3p a day – and Public Health England issued guidance in April advising everyone to take the supplements.  A trial being led by Professor Adrian Martineau of Queen Mary University in London is investigating how certain lifestyle factors – including vitamin D levels – affect susceptibility to the virus.  'Vitamin D could almost be thought of as a designer drug for helping the body to handle viral respiratory infections,' he told The Guardian last night.  A review from the University of Surrey, which was published in the British Medical Journal last month, found that vitamin D should be seen as part of a healthy lifestyle but not as a 'magic bullet' – because the evidence was not yet clear.  Dr Lee Smith, who led Anglia Ruskin's study, said: 'It has been shown to protect against acute respiratory infections, and older adults, the group most deficient in vitamin D, are also the ones most seriously affected by Covid-19.  A previous study found that 75 per cent of people in institutions, such as hospitals and care homes were severely deficient in vitamin D.'  A Public Health England spokesman said: 'NICE is working on a rapid evidence summary on vitamin D in the context of Covid-19 with support from Public Health England. This report will be published in due course.'  The NHS says the general consensus is levels of below 25nmol/L — the equivalent of 10ng/ml — in the blood indicate vitamin D deficiency.  This is thought to be the equivalent of taking around 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day.  The Institute of Medicine — a US health advisory body — states levels below 20ng/ml 50nmol/L is a deficiency.  Large doses of vitamin D can be dangerous, with anything above 100 micrograms to be taken only under medical supervision.

991b2922	Junior doctors have been urged to return to the negotiating table by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who described their 24-hour strike in England as completely unnecessary.    NHS England said about 10,000 junior doctors had reported for duty out of 26,000 scheduled to work the day shift.    Thousands of routine operations have been cancelled during the walkout in protest at a proposed new contract.    The BMA said the strike sent a clear message to the government.    We deeply regret the level of disruption caused, but this is a fight for the long-term safety of patients and junior doctors' working lives, said Dr Johann Malawana, chair of the British Medical Association BMA junior doctors' committee.    He said that junior doctors had no confidence in the new contract.    NHS England apologised to affected patients, and said trusts would try to reschedule cancelled appointments and operations as soon as possible.  'Hardly surprising'    The walkout, which began at 08:00 GMT, comes after talks between the union and government failed to reach agreement on the proposed new contract. The BMA is concerned about pay for weekend working, career progression and safeguards to protect doctors from being overworked.    But ministers have argued the current arrangements are outdated and changes are needed to improve standards of care at the weekend.  media captionEmily Rogers was due to have an operation but it was cancelled because of the strike  media captionConsultant: We'll do whatever is needed to make sure patients are safe    NHS England said more than 3,300 operations had been cancelled on Tuesday - about one in 10 of those planned.    Several hundred more operations have been impacted in the days before and after the strike.    Emily Rogers, from Cheltenham, told the BBC she had been due to have an operation to insert a new feeding tube, which had taken four months to arrange.

Junior doctors who support the industrial action are providing only emergency cover during the 24-hour period.    BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said it was thought many of the 10,000 doctors who turned up were medics who had agreed to work to cover emergency care, although a few thousand were also likely to be doctors who were not members of the BMA and not taking part in strike action.    The BMA said: Since we asked junior doctors who would be covering emergency care to go into work today it is hardly surprising that they have done so along with those who are not members of the BMA.  line  The Sandwell Hospital saga  A demonstrator holds a tray of decorated cakes at a protest by junior doctors outside the Frimley Park Hospital in Frimley, south-west London.image copyrightAFP    By BBC Health editor Hugh Pym    This was supposed to be a day of clear dividing lines with junior doctors going on strike, except those on shifts for urgent and emergency work.    But the understanding clearly broke down at Sandwell Hospital in the West Midlands.    The trust wrote to local junior doctors in a letter dated 11 January, saying they all needed to work because of an internal incident and that it anticipated high patient demand.    Under an agreement struck with the BMA, hospitals can recall striking doctors in the event of life-threatening emergency scenarios.    But the BMA argued Sandwell had not acted in line with the agreement and so instructed members not to heed the hospital management's call.    An awkward stand-off ensued after a handful returned to work. By late afternoon the hospital dropped its call for help and said things were under control.    It was an ominous illustration of what might go wrong in the current fraught atmosphere around the dispute.  line    Mr Hunt said the number that had gone into work showed the values of the vast majority of junior doctors.    We have some disagreements with the BMA over pay. But we all want to promise every patient who uses the NHS the promise of the same high-quality care every day of the week, he said.

Nobody wanted to see industrial action least of all the junior doctors, but we understand why they feel they have no other option, she said.  line  BMA badgeimage copyrightPress Association  What is the dispute about?        The row between junior doctors and the government is over a new contract      Talks broke down in 2014, but the dispute has escalated since the summer after ministers said they would impose the deal      Ministers offered doctors an 11% rise in basic pay last year, but that was offset by curbs to other elements of the pay package, including payments for unsociable hours - they have maintained there is not extra money for junior doctor pay      The government says the changes are needed to create more seven-days services, but the BMA warns safeguards to keep a lid on excessive hours are being weakened      The union balloted its members in the autumn, and 98% of those who voted backed strike action      Talks restarted in December, leading to three days of strikes being called off, but these have so far failed to reach a breakthrough, which is why strikes are taking place      A 48-hour strike is scheduled for Tuesday 26 January - emergency cover will again be provided      An all-out junior doctors' strike is planned for Wednesday 10 February - emergency cover will not be provided      Talks are ongoing and the two sides are set to get around the table again later this week    The junior doctors row explained    What exactly do junior doctors do?

The BMA had refused to agree to the request, arguing it was not clear whether the situation qualified as a major incident.    The number we have been able to safely discharge has increased so that services are safe for tonight and tomorrow, a hospital spokeswoman later said.    Anne Rainsberry, from NHS England, apologised to all patients in England who had been affected.

NHS trusts are now working hard to reschedule cancelled tests, appointments and operations as soon as is possible.    The Patients Association, an independent health charity, urged both sides to continue discussions.    Any new contract must offer terms that are fair for doctors and protect them. Junior doctors are the backbone of the NHS, and it is vital that they are able to provide the safe and effective care that patients need, it added.

c46da247	The majority of UK graduates are being forced into jobs which do not need their talents, according to a newly-published study.  Research for the CIPD Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, which represents human resource managers, shows 58.8 per cent of UK graduates have ended up in non-graduate jobs - a figure exceeded only by Greece and Estonia.  Around one in twelve of those working in low skilled occupations - such as in coffee shops, bars, call centres and front of house at hospitality events - are now graduates, according to the figures.  The research also shows that the UK has the second highest graduation ration amongst Western nations belonging to the OECD - behind Iceland. It shows it has a 54 per cent graduation rate. Germany, by contrast, has a rate of just 31 per cent.  It concludes the growth of graduates is “significantly outstripping the growth of high-skilled jobs generated by the labour market” in most OECD countries. However, it adds the trend is “particularly pronounced in the UK”.  “The assumption that we will transition to a more productive, higher value higher skilled economy by just increasing the conveyor belt of graduates is proven to be flawed,” said Peter Cheese, chief executive of the CIPD.  Instead, employers have started using degrees as a determinant when recruiting for what have traditionally been non-graduate jobs.

Read our privacy notice  “Many graduates are simply replacing non-graduates in less demanding jobs or entering jobs where the demand for graduate skills is non-existent or falling,” says the report.  “This trend has particularly affected occupations where apprenticeships have been historically important such as construction and manufacturing.”  The report’s findings emerge as UK universities are about to enrol a record number of graduates this autumn following the Government’s decision to lift the cap on the number of students universities can recruit.  Around one in 12 people working in low-skilled occupations in the UK are graduates Getty Getty Images  That, coupled with thousands of students aiming to beat the Government’s decision to axe maintenance grants from next September by forgoing gap years, means the number of recruits to universities is set to beat last year’s all-time high of half a million.  Figures published by UCAS, the university and colleges admissions service, showed 461, 120 had already been signed up for university courses this year - a three per cent rise on the same point last year. Of these, 34,000 had been accepted through the clearing system - a rise of six per cent on last year which was itself a record.  In addition, 5,020 of these were late applicants - meaning they could have decided to change their minds after Chancellor George Osborne’s budget decision to scrap maintenance grants.  The rise in student numbers will fuel concerns that growing numbers will be unable to repay their loans if growing numbers are recruited into lower paid jobs. At present, they only have to pay once they are earning £21,000 a year and the debt is written off after 30 years.  “This situation is unsustainable given that the Government estimates that 45 per cent of university graduates will not earn enough to repay their student loans,” said Mr Cheese. The figure is the estimate being worked on by the Government.  “Efforts need to be redoubled to ensure young people who are making choices after receiving their GCSE and A-level results can access good quality careers information, advice and guidance so they can make better informed decisions,” he added.  The report also coincides with further research published this morning showing a dire shortage of apprentices in the UK building industry with 66 per cent of small construction firms admitting they have been forced to turn down new business because they just do not have the employees to carry it out. Almost half have had to outsource work to other firms rather than leave it unfinished.  Watch more  The research by the Federation of Master Builders blames pressure being put on teenagers to stay in full-time education and influence from teachers and family friends to pursue more academic goals.  The CIPD report, which is published the day before more than half a million teenagers received their GCSE results, calls on ministers to raise their efforts to increase the quality and quantity of apprenticeships to plug the skill shortage gaps. It urges employers to review recruitment practices to avoid using degrees as a screening process for jobs who do not require a university education.  Thursday is expected to see little change in the pass rate of 98.5 per cent and the 68.8 per cent getting five or more top grade A* to C grade passes last year. Exams regulator Ofqual has already indicated there will be a further drift in the numbers taking core academic subjects such as maths, English, the sciences, history and geography. The numbers taking modern foreign languages is expected to remain about the same.  A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: “We are providing the right mix of university places and apprenticeships to ensure more people have the opportunity to advance their careers and businesses get the skills they need to grow.  “Demands for higher education remains strong and graduates enjoy a pay premium that reflects their value to employers.”  Case study  Will Swarbrick, 21, enjoyed a distinguished academic career at the University of Warwick graduating in the summer of this year with a First Class history degree.  Will Swarbrick secured a job in the technology sector after completing a history degree  In spite of this academic success he, like many of his counterparts, has entered into employment in an entirely unrelated sector.  Will secured a job just after graduation in the technology sector.  He now works for the games development company Exient, based in Leamington Spa, where he confesses that he rarely uses his degree.  “Unfortunately other than very general, transferable skills my degree hasn’t really come into play in my current job,” he said.  “Although I enjoyed studying history, in reality its practical use is almost non-existent in my current role.”  No longer concerned with Marx and Foucault, Will now spends his days thinking about console, handheld and mobile game development.  Does he feel the degree provided good value for money?  “Not yet, but maybe at some point in the longer term.”  He does not regret his choice to study history but is now more mindful of the non-academic aspects of university education like extra-curricular activities and employer networking.  He wishes that his university had provided more hands-on, practical employment support and says that such support was insufficient while he was an undergraduate.  “The university tried their best with emails and occasional talks, but real-world experience could have been better.”  He suggests that universities could have built employability sessions into the curriculum from the beginning of the degree course and could have made access to employer information more readily available.  He advises future graduates to put more emphasis on part-time work and work experience to build a successful CV.  “I had a job while studying for my degree and I’m sure this has helped me secure my current employment.”  Harvey Day	Majority of UK graduates are being forced into non-graduate work, says study	partially false
b0ba5e99	Britain is footing a £36million bill for the closure of the Jungle migrant camp in Calais.  Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the UK would help pay for the evacuation that began on Monday and for measures to keep the site shut.  The UK has already pledged £80million to pay private security firms to patrol ports in northern France for three years.  Scroll down for video  More than 2,000 migrants were moved from the Jungle on Monday but many more remain pictured and there are fears a hardcore will refuse to budge  And a few weeks ago the British government agreed to fund the £2million ‘Great Wall of Calais’ to stop stowaways sneaking across the Channel.  It means British taxpayers face a total bill of £118million to secure the Jungle site and the French ports over the next three years, despite charities warning many migrants will inevitably return.  The frontrunner for the French presidential elections, Alain Juppé, has also threatened to tear up the Le Touquet deal that allows Britain to carry out border checks in France.  Amber Rudd left is willing to give France £118 million to help clear up the migrant mess and secure borders but Alain Juppé right, with a supporter wants to remove Britain's right to carry out border checks on the French side of the border  French authorities finally began evacuating the makeshift Jungle camp ahead of its demolition, which was due to start today.  The first 2,000 migrants were evacuated to temporary accommodation centres around France.  But in a series of developments:  Charities warned thousands more migrants could refuse to leave over the coming days because of their desperation to reach Britain;  Hundreds gathered in protests, chanting ‘UK, UK, UK,’ and vowed to build a new Jungle;  Others vowed they would return to Calais if relocated, and step up illegal efforts to cross the Channel;  British police joined the search to identify up to 200 British anarchists intent on fuelling protests at the camp;  Up to 70 young male refugees arrived at a 17th Century manor house in Devon;  France asked Britain to temporarily suspend the transfer of child refugees.  In an urgent statement to the Commons Miss Rudd said responsibility for Calais rested with the French government, but insisted border controls between the two countries were vital to Britain’s security.  She said: ‘The UK Government will be contributing up to £36m to maintain the security of these controls, to support the camp clearance and to ensure in the long term that the camp is kept closed. This funding will also be used to help keep children safe in France.  A young migrant cycles through the remains of the camp on Monday night. Most of those still inside the Jungle are young men, mostly from Africa  ‘This contribution is not made unconditionally, and we will continue to work with the French Government to ensure that the clearance operation is full and lasting.’  The Home Secretary said British officials were only given access to the camp to begin interviewing children last week.  Britain could not begin transferring unaccompanied children until it had permission from France, which was only given recently, she said.  But in Calais, migrants said they would build a new Jungle as buses began taking hundreds of mainly Sudanese and Eritrean men to temporary accommodation centres around France.  A migrant from Ethiopia's persecuted Oromo tribe hugs a friend as he leaves the Jungle today  Many left willingly but others said they would ‘rather die’ than give up on their dreams of reaching the UK.  Scuffles broke out as a poorly-managed crowd of migrants was penned together by French riot police while they waited to be processed.  As dusk fell, protests were held by those unwilling to leave, who chanted ‘UK, UK, UK!’ and fires raged in the camp amid claims that migrants had torched an area used as a base by British charity workers.  Riot police were on standby amid fears up to 200 anarchists from the British group No Borders had infiltrated the camp over the weekend and were intent on violence.  A 16-year-old migrant from Ethiopia cries as he waits to register at a processing centre in the the Jungle near Calais  A helicopter flew overhead and two specialist ‘spotter’ officers from the Metropolitan Police joined their French counterparts to help search for suspects.  Many migrants told the Daily Mail the closure of the camp meant they would step up efforts to cross the Channel by any means necessary.  Imran Ali, 20, from Afghanistan, said: ‘We must get to the UK. If I die it’s no problem. I would rather die than stay here. In France they don’t like refugees. They treat refugees like dogs.’  Another man fleeing Afghanistan admitted several of his friends in their 20s had tried to register as children in a bid to reach Britain.  The migrants were registered before getting onto buses which took them from Calais to reception centres the length and breadth of France  His admission follows widespread concern that some of the ‘child’ refugees brought to Britain appeared to be far older than 18.  In Calais four men were spotted attempting to board a British-registered lorry as it halted at traffic lights in the town centre.  Christian Salome, president of the French charity Auberge des Migrants, said he expected 2,000 people in the Jungle to refuse to leave.  He told French newspaper La Voix du Nord: ‘They still want to get to England.  'If the evacuations have been calm on Monday, you have to be far more careful in the coming days when the only ones left are the ones who don’t want to leave, and are adamant that they are going to keep trying to get to England.’  Many migrants are still determined to get into Britain by hook or by crook  French authorities admitted those willing to leave had been delayed by a lack of buses, and one accommodation centre in Loubeyrat, central France, was set alight just hours before the migrants were due to arrive.  The Home Office said it had temporarily suspended transferring child refugees from the camp to Britain at the request of the French.  Labour MP Luciana Berger said social workers working in the UK had described a ‘bureaucratic shambles’, with wrong names and addresses given out and the wrong forms submitted.  The Home Secretary told the Commons there were 36 British officials working to find and prioritise the youngest and most vulnerable children and Britain had a ‘moral responsibility’ to help.  She said British officials have interviewed around 800 children in the Jungle and almost 200 have been brought to the UK so far, including 60 girls said to be at high risk of sexual exploitation.  Charities estimate more than 1,000 children could still be inside, including 49 unaccompanied children aged under 13, and three under 11, and warned they remained at risk of trafficking and abuse.  The Home Secretary said several hundred more children would arrive in Britain in the next few weeks, but new children who arrived in Calais after the Jungle was cleared would not be accepted in this country.  England Test star of the future? Migrants play cricket in the camp just before dusk on Monday  French newspaper Le Figaro said around 500 unaccompanied children in Calais were claiming to have family in the UK, meaning they were eligible to come here.  Miss Rudd said 800 had been interviewed and 200 had been transferred to Britain, with several hundred more expected to follow in the next few weeks.  She said children accepted as unaccompanied refugees would not be allowed to ‘sponsor’ their parents to come and join them in the UK.  Conservatives called for Britain to step up its border security to prevent migrants making last-ditch attempts to make their way across the Channel.  Charlie Elphicke, MP for Dover in Kent, said: ‘People will be more desperate than ever to see if they can break into Britain.’	Britain picks up £36m bill for closure of the Calais 'Jungle' camp	false
856e15b2	The number of people dying in police custody has reached its highest level for five years, according to the latest figures released hours before the home secretary launches an independent review following decades of pressure from families who have lost loved ones.  The new statistics from the Independent Police Complaints Commission IPCC say 17 people died in or following detention by the police in 2014-15 – six more than during the previous year.  15 of 17 who died in custody were white,1 Asian and 1 black person; Dead include 14 men & 3 women, ages ranged from 22 to 57 years, say IPCC — vikram dodd @VikramDodd July 23, 2015  The last time the figure was higher was in 2010-11 when it stood at 21. The IPCCalso revealed that there were 69 apparent suicides following custody. This is 50% higher than the 46 people in 2010-11.  On Thursday afternoon Theresa May will launch an independent review of deaths in police custody and promise to stamp out the “evasiveness and obstruction” suffered by families at the hands of the authorities. The home secretary aims to transform public confidence in the police, declaring that she has been “been struck by the pain and suffering of families still looking for answers”.  The speech, to be given in south London, is expected to touch on some of the most emotive issues in the police’s relationship with the communities it serves and follows five years of barely concealed running warfare between ministers and the police under the Conservative-led coalition.    The invite for selected guests to attend on Thursday afternoon hails the significance of May’s speech. It reads: “The home secretary will set out the government’s reforms to transform the relationship between the public and the police and to preserve the historic principle that the public are the police and the police are the public.”  We have published the statistics for deaths during or following police contact in 2014/15 http://t.co/CYCLHjmAyU pic.twitter.com/S1JYA2Vc2w — IPCC @IPCCNews July 23, 2015  May will return to a subject she focused on in an uncompromising 2014 speech to the conference of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers. She warned then that abuses by officers had jeopardised the bedrock of British law enforcement – policing by consent of the public.    Families and those who have helped their battles for justice said they wanted to learn the full details of the government’s plans before giving their blessing.    In extracts released in advance by her officials, May says: “In my time as home secretary, I have been struck by the pain and suffering of families still looking for answers, who have encountered not compassion and redress from the authorities, but what they feel as evasiveness and obstruction.  “I have also heard first-hand the frustration of police officers and staff, whose mission it is to help people but whose training and procedures can end up causing bureaucracy and delay.  “No one – least of all police officers – wants such incidents to happen, and I know everyone involved takes steps to avoid them. But when such incidents do occur, every single one represents a failure – and has the potential to undermine dramatically the relationship between the public and the police.”  The review of deaths in custody will investigate the restraint methods used by officers and how incidents are investigated, following sustained criticism of the IPCC from families.  It will also examine how to provide alternative places for people with mental health problems, so they do not end up in a police cell with officers acting as a service of last resort because there is no other service available.  In April, the Guardian revealed that the home secretary had held several meetings with the families of two men who died in custody – Sean Rigg and Olaseni Lewis – and wrote to them to say how moved she was by their suffering, which was made worse by the failings of the criminal justice system. Rigg and Lewis died after restraint by officers in 2008 and 2010 respectively. Their families are yet to receive full answers and the final resolution they want despite years of legal action.    The home secretary, Theresa May. Photograph: Rex Shutterstock  Ajibola Lewis, the mother of Olaseni Lewis, said families such as hers should have been consulted by the home secretary about what the review should examine and it was too early to tell if it was a public relations exercise or meaningful: “We are surprised that the proposed review, its purpose and its scope is being announced without any prior consultation with us or other families in our position.”    Lewis added: “We find deep-seated and repeated failures on the part of all of the agencies of the state to whom we look to take responsibility to investigate and prevent such deaths, including those concerned within the senior management of our police service, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, the Crown Prosecution Service and the coroner’s courts.”    Marcia Rigg-Samuel said of the proposed review: “There is a clear need for a radical overhaul of how the whole system works following a death in police custody, and I hope that the independent review will address this, as well as the root causes of these avoidable deaths and ensuring accountability for those who fail in their duties to members of the public.”  The latest official statistics show that in 2013-14, 68 people took their own lives within two days of being arrested or detained, the highest figure for a decade. There were also 11 deaths during or after police custody. May will say: “All too often vulnerable people, often those with mental health problems, are taken because there is no other place to go.”  It is also expected that May will promise to make the police more diverse because police officers are currently more white than the communities they serve.    The speech follows a raft of announcements on key policy areas from the new Conservative government, showing that despite only having a small majority, it will not shy away from pursuing its agenda, which it says is reformist and radical, while critics dismiss it as dogmatic and divisive.  Now elected with a parliamentary majority and armed with a fresh electoral mandate, the Conservatives seem set to take on the police service between now and 2020. Ministers will say they are necessary reforms, while some in policing will see it as a continuation of bashing a service already diminished and demoralised by the past five years, which have seen large budget cuts.  The home secretary is threatening police with legislation over their use of stop and search powers if they do not demonstrate that they are voluntarily stamping out the excessive targeting of black people and other minority groups.  As part of the drive to professionalise the police, the government pressed for a College of Policing to be founded, which it was in 2012. Its chief executive officer, Alex Marshall, said: “Police officers and custody staff do a difficult job dealing with detained individuals who may be aggressive and abusive. However, policing is often seen as a service of last resort, and officers often come into contact with people in a vulnerable state.    “While we have seen significant improvement in this area over the past decade, much remains to be done to improve cross-sector work. It is vital that health and social services recognise their role to help prevent the tragic loss to the families involved.”  Deborah Coles, of Inquest, which supports those who have lost loved ones during detention or contact with state agencies, said: “It is too early to tell if this is more about a public relations exercise than a real attempt to bring about effective systemic change and the necessary accountability of police officers.”	Deaths in police custody at highest level for five years	partially false
688adf93	The number of Britons taking up EU citizenship of another member state more than doubled in the year of the Brexit referendum, official EU figures show.  Eurostat, the EU’s statistics agency, shows that 6,555 British nationals acquired such citizenship in 2016, up from 2,478 in 2015.  Germany was the biggest country for Britons to adopt the citizenship of, with 2,702. France and Belgium followed with 517 and 506 citizens each.  Other​ significant beneficiaries of British citizens were Cyprus, Ireland and Italy.  “We are seeing a Brexodus of people giving up their passports and rushing to take citizenship in EU countries as Brexit draws near,” Paul Butters, a spokesperson for the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, said.  “People have done this to give themselves some security. This should make David Davis ashamed that people feel they have no option but to give up their citizenship or apply to be a dual national. These people are giving up part of their identity to try to secure their future.  “The government don’t seem to care and their only interest is their ill advised ‘tens of thousands’ immigration target.  “The government dragged their feet over EU citizens’ rights and this is the real life manifestation of their tactics. The government should be incredibly embarrassed today.”  Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox every weekday Please enter your email address Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP Thanks for signing up to the Inside Politics newsletter {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

British citizens will lose the automatic rights to work and settle in other EU countries after Brexit, making UK passports less powerful. The government has, however, said British passports will be changed to blue, which Brexiteers claimed could not be the case while the UK was still in the bloc.  The EU referendum was held on 23 June 2016 meaning that any acceleration of applications for citizenship after the referendum would only have applied in the second half of the year.

One possible post-Brexit immigration scheme could struggle to channel workers towards less attractive roles - while another may heighten the risk of labour exploitation, a new report warns. PA The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Customs union A key point in the negotiations remains Britain's access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does? No 10 has so far insisted that “Brexit means Brexit” and that Britain will be leaving the customs union, but may be inclined to change its position once the potential risks to the UK’s economic outlook become clearer. Alamy The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Northern Ireland-Irish border Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. To ensure borderless travel on the island, the countries must be in regulatory alignment and therefore adhere to the same rules as the customs union. In December, the Conservative Party’s coalition partners, the DUP, refused a draft agreement that would place the UK/EU border in the Irish Sea due to its potential to undermine the union. May has promised that would not be the case and has suggested that a “specific solution” would need to be found. Getty The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Transition period Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit. The talks, however, have reached an impasse. Though May has agreed that the UK will continue to contribute to the EU budget until 2021, the PM wants to be able to select which laws made during this time the UK will have to adhere to. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said the UK must adopt all of the laws passed during the transition, without any input from British ministers or MEPs. EPA The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Rights of EU citizens living the UK The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear. May insists that those who arrive during the transition period should not be allowed to stay, whereas the EU believe the cut-off point should be later. Getty The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Future trade agreement with the EU Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU. Infighting within the Cabinet has prevented a solid position from being reached, with some MPs content that no deal is better than a bad deal while others rally behind single market access. The EU has already confirmed that access to the single market would be impossible without the UK remaining in the customs union. Getty The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Future trade agreements internationally The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London. However the UK cannot make trade agreements with another country while it is still a member of the EU, and the potential loss of trade with the world's major powers is a source of anxiety for the PM. The EU has said the UK cannot secure trade deals during the transition period. EPA The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Financial services Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal. However according to new reports Germany has suggested allowing trade on the condition that the UK continues paying into the EU budget even after the transition period. Getty  Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs said in late 2017 that more than a fifth of all Irish passports issued in the last year went to people living in the UK.  The department in Dublin said more than 779,000 of the Republic’s passports were issued in 2017, a record figure, with 81,752 Irish citizens in Northern Ireland being among those who received passports.  The European parliament has repeatedly called in its resolutions for exploration of some mechanism by which British people can opt-in to keep their EU citizenship, but little actual movement has been made on this so far in talks – with such a system looking increasingly unlikely.

14010ae5	Today, the Court of Appeal has ruled that the so-called ‘bedroom tax’ is unlawful because of its impact on vulnerable individuals. The Court of Appeal dealt with two appeals together and in both cases ruled that the discrimination against victims of domestic violence and disabled children was not lawful.  One appeal, brought by a woman known only as ‘A,’ concerned the effect of the policy on women living in ‘Sanctuary Scheme’ homes – properties which are specially adapted because of risks to the lives and physical safety of women and children who live in them. The second appeal, brought by Paul and Susan Rutherford and their grandson Warren, concerns the impact of the policy on seriously disabled children who need overnight care. In both appeals, the judges accepted that the bedroom tax policy unlawfully discriminates – against women and domestic violence victims, and against seriously disabled children requiring overnight care.  A’s Appeal  This appeal is brought by a woman known only as ‘A’ because her identity must be protected for her own safety. She is a victim of rape, assault, harassment and stalking at the hands of an ex-partner. She challenges the under-occupation provisions/ size criteria, colloquially known as the ‘bedroom tax’. She claims that the housing benefit regulations which have introduced the scheme are discriminatory and will have devastating consequences for her and her 11-year-old son.  Under the ‘bedroom tax’, A and her son are only entitled to receive housing benefit for a 2-bedroom property. However they live in a 3-bedroom property which has been specially adapted for them by the police pursuant to a Sanctuary Scheme, because her life and physical safety are at risk from her ex-partner who has a history of serious violence. Her housing benefit has been reduced by 14% given the Secretary of State’s policy.  The Sanctuary Scheme aims to enable householders at risk of violence to remain safely in their own home by installing a ‘Sanctuary’ within the home and provide support to the household. A has had a ‘panic space’ installed in her home, as well as a specialist ‘sanctuary system’. This includes expensive reinforced doors, electric alarms, a marker on the house and alarms linked to the police station.  Her legal team solicitor Rebekah Carrier at Hopkin Murray Beskine and barristers Karon Monaghan QC, Matrix Chambers, and Caoilfhionn Gallagher and Katie O’Byrne, Doughty Street Chambers argued that the Secretary of State had failed to take into account the disproportionate impact of the ‘bedroom tax’ upon victims of domestic violence, who are overwhelmingly women, and in particular those in Sanctuary Scheme homes.  According to figures obtained in freedom of information responses from 79 local authorities, almost 1 in 20 households using the Sanctuary Scheme for people at risk of severe domestic violence have been affected by the under-occupancy penalty or bedroom tax, totalling 281 households across the country. The vast majority of people in the Sanctuary Scheme are women.  Rebekah Carrier, the solicitor acting for A, said:  “These changes to housing benefit have had a catastrophic impact upon vulnerable people across the country. Our client’s life is at risk and she is terrified. The anxiety caused by the bedroom tax and the uncertainty about this case has been huge. She lives in a property which has been specially adapted by the police, at great expense, to protect her and her child. The prospect of having to move to another property where she will not have any of these protections or take in a lodger has loomed large for her during the three years it has taken this case to come to the Court of Appeal. She is a vulnerable single parent who has been a victim of rape and assault. She is delighted that the Court of Appeal has recognised the impact that the bedroom tax is having on her and others like her. She very much hopes that the Secretary of State will now see sense and agree to change the rules to protect the small but extremely vulnerable class of women and children who need the safety of a sanctuary scheme whilst they try to rebuild their lives after surviving domestic violence.  “An investment has been made in keeping these vulnerable women safe and to move families in these circumstances out of their homes is a false economy as it will cost further money to provide security at the new property, and this may provide a reduced level of safety, putting them at risk. It is important to remember that on average two women every week are killed by a current or former partner in England and Wales – protecting abused women and their children is a matter of life and death, and we should always remember this.”  A’s claim is supported by evidence from the charity Women’s Aid on the prevalence of domestic violence and on the important function of Sanctuary Schemes in providing protection and preventing homelessness for those at risk.  The Rutherford Appeal  Paul and Susan Rutherford care for their severely disabled grandson, Warren, in a special-adapted three bedroom bungalow in Pembrokeshire. Warren has a rare genetic disorder, Potokoi-Shaffer Syndrome, and is unable to walk, talk or feed himself and requires24 hour care. In the judgement handed down today, the Court found that the ‘bedroom tax’ discriminates against disabled children in breach of the Human Rights Act.  Both Paul and Susan have disabilities themselves and can only care for Warren with the help of paid carers who stay overnight on a regular basis. The couple was hit by the bedroom tax for their third bedroom which they need for the carers to stay in overnight and for storing disability equipment for Warren. The current regulations allow for an additional bedroom if a disabled adult requires overnight care but not for a disabled child in the same situation. The Court found that this unlawfully discriminates against disabled children and cannot be justified.  The family had launched a judicial review challenging the ‘bedroom tax’ which reduces housing benefit payments to tenants deemed to be under-occupying their accommodation. They have been receiving discretionary payments from the local authority to cover the shortfall in rent but the Court found this policy was not adequate as there is no guarantee it would continue to be available to them in the future.  Lord Thomas CJ found that the failure of the Secretary of State to make provision in the regulations for overnight carers of disabled children amounted to unlawful discrimination contrary to Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It was “very difficult to justify the treatment within the same regulation of carers for disabled children and disabled adults, where precisely the opposite result is achieved: provision for the carers of disabled adults but not for the carers of disabled children.” The Secretary of State had also failed to have regard to the best interests of disabled children when devising the regulations.  Mike Spencer, solicitor at the Child Poverty Action Group, who acts for the Rutherfords, said,  ‘We are delighted that disabled children will finally be entitled to the same treatment as disabled adults. It is absurd to have a situation where children like Warren might have to go into residential care at vast cost to the taxpayer because their families cannot pay for the housing they need. Instead of putting this family through the ordeal of a further appeal, the Government should now think seriously about amending the regulations to protect severely disabled children.’  NOTES FOR EDITORS:	Court of appeal rules that ‘bedroom tax’ is unlawful	false
5d57071e	Chris Guest More pictured became one of the UK’s most wanted criminals after he fled to Spain following the shocking torture and murder of Brian Waters in June 2003  Tens of thousands of crime suspects are on the loose because of the ‘near perilous’ state of policing.  The official watchdog says many cases are being shelved without proper investigation, emergency calls downgraded and victims left in danger.  Almost 46,000 suspects are now on the police wanted database including 343 sought for murder or manslaughter and 1,012 for rape.  The hard-hitting report from HM Inspectorate of Constabulary accused the 43 forces of England and Wales of failing the public.  Zoe Billingham, who heads the watchdog, said: ‘We are leading to a very serious conclusion regarding the potentially perilous state of British policing in this report. We are raising a red flag: it is a large red flag.’  Her inspection concluded that:  A shortage of detectives and investigators amounted to a ‘national crisis’;  Constabularies wrote off too many domestic abuse cases;  2,700 sex offenders had not been fully assessed for the risk they posed to the public;  Only 19 per cent of the public had seen a beat bobby in the past month as the decline of community policing continued;  Gangs of dangerous criminals were not being formally classified and monitored.  Police unions blamed crippling cuts to budgets as part of the national austerity drive.  Since 2009 – the year before the Tory-led coalition came to power – forces have lost around 21,500 officers. Miss Billingham said the issues facing the police were not solely down to the budget cuts imposed by the Government.  Twenty per cent of the 45,960 wanted suspects on the database were being sought for theft and one in eight for violence. Other main categories included terrorism and firearms offences.  HMIC said it had serious concerns that forces were taking ‘insufficient action’ to actively find suspects. It added: ‘Too often suspects wanted in connection with crimes are not being tracked down relentlessly.’  Among those who have fled justice is a man alleged to have shot dead a teenager and then a mother of three 12 months later.  THE FUGITIVES WHO ARE WANTED FOR RAPE AND MURDER Chris Guest More MURDER Chris Guest More, 39, became one of the UK’s most wanted criminals after he fled to Spain following the shocking torture and murder of Brian Waters in June 2003. Three men were jailed but More has never been found after fleeing 36 hours after the attack in Tabley, Cheshire. His millionaire father Christopher was jailed for nine months in 2004 for assisting an offender after visiting his son in Malaga with cash and clothes. David Ungi MURDER David Ungi, 24, is thought to be in the Netherlands after fleeing Britain 18 hours after the 2015 drive-by shooting of Vinny Waddington, 18, in Liverpool. Arif Chowdhury CHILD ABUSE Arif Chowdhury, 20, the suspected ringleader of a gang who allegedly raped a girl of 13, fled after he was freed on bail. Police believe he is hiding in Bangladesh. Kevin Thomas Parle MURDER Kevin Thomas Parle, 36, fled Liverpool after the shooting of Liam Kelly, 16, in 2004. A year later he became a suspect in the killing of mother Lucy Hargreaves. Sultan Amari RAPE Syrian migrant Sultan Amari, 46, fled to Turkey during his trial last year for raping a university student in Chester. He was given 11 years’ jail in his absence. Costas Sampson RAPE Costas Sampson, 26, a Greek Cypriot, fled the country on the day he was due to stand trial for the rape of a girl he met in a London nightclub in 2010. Advertisement  Others on the run include a Syrian migrant rapist who fled to Turkey half way through his trial last year. HMIC found that the details of at least 67,000 people suspected of committing offences were not on the database – if stopped in another part of the country it would not flag up that they were wanted.  Inspectors said the public was being left at ‘unacceptable risk’ because some hard-pressed forces were downgrading emergency calls. This meant officers would be permitted to respond to a call within an hour, instead of the standard 15 minutes.  Another tactic was that of failing to send officers to domestic abuse incidents. The 128-page report said the ‘unwelcome practices’ had the effect of ‘artificially suppressing the demand for the police to take prompt and effective action’. The watchdog said this was a form of rationing of police services.  One in five investigations were never taken further because the victim ‘did not support police action’. In domestic abuse cases, this rose to a third. Inspectors said some forces were using this option to close investigations prematurely.  The report said: ‘Overuse of this outcome is likely to mean that far too many perpetrators of extremely harmful domestic abuse crimes are not being brought to justice and victims are being failed by the police.’  Miss Billingham said: ‘We have seen how some forces are attempting to reduce pressure on their teams by artificially suppressing or downgrading calls upon their service, reducing their ability to take the most effective and prompt action. This is often an unintended consequence of recent changes forces have made, frequently in response to the challenge of austerity, and as they struggle to respond to increasing and ever changing levels of demand.  ‘Consequently, some basic things are not being done. We found evidence of fewer arrests being made, some crimes are being shelved without proper investigations and suspects are not always being relentlessly tracked down.’  Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Brian Paddick, a former senior police officer, said: ‘It is totally unacceptable that police officers, who are doing more than anyone can reasonably expect of them, are being forced to downgrade “life at risk” calls.  ‘How long before someone dies because there is no police officer to respond? The police are not doing enough to keep us safe from some of the most dangerous criminals. Hundreds of killers and rapists are not being kept under control. These people should not be on our streets.’  Lucy Hastings, of the charity Victim Support, said victims were being let down.  Overall, one force was judged to be outstanding, 28 were good, 13 required improvement and one was rated inadequate. Michael Barton, the National Police Chiefs’ Council spokesman for crime operations, said it was disappointing that HMIC had concerns that some forces were falling short.  He blamed budget reductions and the loss of thousands of officers and staff, adding: ‘It’s a simple reality that we are required to prioritise more.’  Steve White of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said: ‘What we are seeing is a service that is only being driven by cost constraints and some areas of policing are on the critical list and heading towards intensive care.’  Brandon Lewis, the Minister for Policing and the Fire Service, said: 'I am pleased that two-thirds of forces are rated in today’s report as either good or outstanding.  'But a number clearly still have to do more to deliver the services communities expect and deserve. Those identified as inadequate or requiring improvement must take urgent action.  'I am also concerned by HMIC's findings over wanted suspects not being recorded on the Police National Computer. Police chiefs must respond swiftly and decisively to HMIC’s recommendation, to ensure this unacceptable situation is rectified.'

6ffa74c1	Only one in every five migrants claiming asylum in Europe is from Syria.  The EU logged 213,000 arrivals in April, May and June but only 44,000 of them were fleeing the Syrian civil war.  Campaigners and left-wing MPs have suggested the vast majority of migrants are from the war-torn state, accusing the Government of doing too little to help them.  'This exposes the lie peddled in some quarters that vast numbers of those reaching Europe are from Syria,' said David Davies, Tory MP for Monmouth. 'Most people who are escaping the war will go to camps in Lebanon or Jordan.  'Many of those who have opted to risk their lives to come to Europe have done so for economic reasons.'  Hungary has announced plans to build a giant fence along the Croatian border - just days after sealing off access from Serbia with a 100 mile razor-wire barrier pictured  One man lifts a crying baby as he waits to board a bus heading for a reception centre for migrants in Croatia's capital of Zagreb  Sir Bill Cash, a fellow Tory, said: 'These figures make extremely disturbing reading. The whole argument has been made that this influx is all real refugees from Syria whereas this adds to the substantial evidence that there are a large number of economic migrants who are aiming for a better life.'  The figures from Eurostat, the EU's official statistical agency, show that migration from April to June was running at double the level of the same period in 2014.  The number of Afghans lodging asylum claims is up four-fold, from 6,300 to 27,000. Another 17,700 claims were made by Albanians, whose country is at peace.  A further 13,900 applicants came from Iraq which, like Syria, is being torn apart by the Islamic State terror group.  This exposes the lie peddled in some quarters that vast numbers of those reaching Europe are from Syria. David Davies, Tory MP for Monmouth  Half a million migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, with 156,000 coming in August alone. Rather than claiming asylum in the first safe EU country they reach, most head on toward wealthy northern states. The human cost of the crisis has been paid by the estimated 3,000 migrants who have drowned after putting their lives in the hands of people smugglers for the perilous crossing of the Mediterranean.  Risks being taken by many families were highlighted by the deaths of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi and his brother Galip, five, whose bodies were washed up on the tourist beach of Bodrum in Turkey earlier this month.  More than 250,000 migrants have reached Greece and Italy, where the authorities are close to breaking point.  Struggling to cope: Croatia's Prime Minister said today that his country will redirect migrants to Hungary and Slovenia  Police officers watch on as migrants sit on the windows of a train at a railway station near the Slovenian-Croatian border in Dobova, Brezice  Refugees are making increasingly desperate attempts to cross Europe. A group of migrants are pictured trying to cross the river Sutla near Senkovec, Croatia on their way to Slovenia  DAILY MAIL COMMENT TO listen to the BBC, you might believe that every one of the hundreds of thousands of migrants clamouring to get into the EU was a Syrian refugee fleeing the horror of Islamic State or tyrannical president Bashar al-Assad. But new Eurostat figures show the truth: 80 per cent are from as far afield as Pakistan, Nigeria and Albania - many of them economic migrants simply looking for a better life. The Mail does not underestimate the agony and desperation of genuine Syrian asylum seekers who, of course, deserve care and compassion. That’s why David Cameron was right to ensure that those granted refuge in Britain come from camps on the Syrian border, rather than from among those already in Europe – who may not be Syrian. But Germany – by first extending a welcome to all migrants, then slamming its borders shut when overwhelming numbers responded to the invitation – has created chaos for all its neighbours, where untold numbers are now stranded. Through her naive and muddled policy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has placed the very future of the EU in jeopardy. Advertisement  German Chancellor Angela Merkel fuelled the chaos last month by declaring that any Syrian who reached the country could claim asylum.  When the numbers became uncontrollable Berlin shut its borders, throwing Austria, Hungary and other EU countries into turmoil.  Croatia has received 14,000 migrants in the past two days and was last night moving some to the Hungarian border.  Hungary is laying razor wire on the border having done the same on its border with Serbia.  Croatia has closed seven of eight road crossings to Serbia and ordered its border guards to redirect migrants to Hungary and Slovenia. The Hungarian government described this as 'totally unacceptable'.  Violence broke out yesterday between Syrian and Afghan migrants fighting to board trains across Croatia.  And Slovenian riot police last night stood in the path of 200 migrants trying to enter from Croatia. Slovenian ministers say they will accept asylum seekers but send back anyone deemed to be an illegal immigrant.  Britain, which received 7,470 asylum applications between April and June, has come under fire for failing to join an EU scheme to spread 160,000 migrants between the 28 member states.  A man uses crutches as he joins other migrants crossing the border between Greece and Macedonia near the city of Gevgelija, Macedonia  Refugees sit under a bridge at the border between Austria and Germany, in Freilassing, southern Germany this morning  GERMANY COULD SPEND UP TO €25 BILLION ON MIGRANT INTAKE Germany's lead in housing hundreds of thousands of migrants heading to Europe from a war-torn Middle East could cost its Treasury tens of billions of euros over the next two years, according to early private estimates. The Japanese investment bank Mizuho was one of the first to put a number on it on yesterday, saying that accepting up to one million refugees a year over the next two years could cost Berlin €25 billion euros. That is derived from a basic calculation of €12,500 per migrant, according to Peter Chatwell, senior rates strategist at Mizuho. Part of the extra spending may have to be met by extra borrowing. Over half a dozen banks contacted by Reuters broadly agreed with Mizuho's calculations. Advertisement  David Cameron has announced the UK will shelter 20,000 vulnerable Syrians from camps in Lebanon and Jordan. But he rejected calls to take migrants already in Europe, saying this would encourage more to make the dangerous journey.  Yvette Cooper, who chairs Labour's refugee taskforce, said: 'Britain's approach of only planning to take refugees from the camps in Syria isn't working.  'It ignores the crisis also happening in Europe itself and means Britain has no leverage to get other countries to sign up to help.'  But a Home Office spokesman said: 'Claiming asylum must not be viewed as an easy means of settlement by those who are not actually refugees.  'We need systems which keep out unfounded claims so we can all respond more quickly and effectively to those genuinely in need of refuge.

The minor royal will get married at the same venue as Harry and Meghan.  Labour’s Chris Williamson said: “It really is an outrage.”  Security expenses for Princess Eugenie’s wedding have more than doubled amid increased terror fears since she announced her engagement in January, sources say.  Extra firearms officers may have to be drafted in when the ninth in line to the throne weds tequila brand ambassador Jack Brooksbank on October 12.  Eugenie, 28, who carries out no royal duties, has nevertheless chosen to marry at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle where Prince Harry wed Meghan in May.  Image: Getty Image: Splash News  Dad Prince Andrew was said to have demanded a similarly glitzy event for his younger daughter with Sarah Ferguson.  A royal source said: “The Duke of York has insisted his daughter’s wedding must be a huge occasion to be remembered and wants everyone to get on board to celebrate the happy couple.”  Despite warnings about the extra security issues it would cause, Eugenie and Jack are determined to enjoy all the pomp of an open-top carriage procession down Windsor High Street.  Image: Splash News  It means dozens of officers must be deployed to search the route in advance.  Drones will also be banned from flying over the castle for the whole weekend.  The same tactics were employed for the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, but Eugenie’s wedding was initially set to cost around £750,000.  The increased expenses are due to officers’ overtime, cancellation of holidays and the need for extra patrols.

She said: “In these times of heightened security risks it is irresponsible for a minor member of the royal family to have a high-profile, very public wedding.  “This may be the time to review the role and cost of minor royals.”  Eugenie and sister Beatrice, 30, said this month they just want to be seen as “real”.  Image: Internet Unknown Image: Splash News  But Chris Williamson, Labour MP for Derby North, said tonight: “It really is an outrage when you’ve got people sleeping rough and gripped by poverty that people are indulging in this conspicuous consumption.  “They are as far as it’s possible to be from being real normal people. No one else gets their wedding paid for by the public purse and they’ve got the resources to do it themselves.”  Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon 8 Cancel Play now  Police sources say there is no intelligence of any threat or sign of any serious anti-monarchy protests, but nothing will be left to chance.  The huge security operation will be managed by the Met, Thames Valley and British Transport Police.  But amid heightened terror fears in London after this week’s Westminster attack, other forces are understood to have been asked to potentially help out as other teams are needed in the capital.  Image: Splash News Image: Reuters  Eugenie and Jack, 32, who is UK representative for George Clooney’s tequila brand Casamigos, will host 300 guests including dozens of celebrities such as Clooney and his lawyer wife Amal, who were at Harry’s wedding too.  Model Cara Delevingne, actress Suki Waterhouse and supermodels Kate Moss and Cindy Crawford could also attend, alongside singers James Blunt and Ellie Goulding, and pop star Robbie Williams and wife Ayda Field, whose daughter Theodora Rose will be a flower girl.  Beatrice will be maid of honour and Prince William’s children George, five, and Charlotte, three, are expected to be a page boy and flower girl.  Image: Getty  Invitations have also been extended to 1,200 members of the public who will watch the event outside via a live feed.  Eugenie’s cousin Zara, also one of the Queen’s grandchildren, wed ex-England rugby captain Mike Tindall in a small ceremony in Edinburgh in 2011.  Jack’s and Eugenie’s parents will pay for the wedding and reception. A royal spokesman said: “Costs for security will be shared by individual police forces and the local council but all other costs for the wedding will be met privately.”  Wedding list Princess Eugenie Victoria Helena of York is her full title.  She is the Queen’s sixth grandchild while currently ninth in the line of succession.  Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank have been together for 7 years.  The couple are blood relatives. The Duchess of York is the great-great-granddaughter of Lady Julia Coke, who is the daughter of Jack’s great-great-grandfather, Thomas Coke.  There are expected to be 350 guests inside St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, with senior members of the Royal Family including the Queen, and supermodels Cara Delevingne and Cindy Crawford.  Eugenie could opt for British designer Erdem or Vivienne Westwood for her wedding dress.  For: It's right for her to marry at the Castle  Ingrid Seward  Majesty Magazine Editor in chief  Having known Princess Eugenie and her sister Beatrice for many years I can honestly say you could never meet two lovelier, more polite and well-grounded women.  They are a credit to family and friends. They are making their way in the world with successful jobs as well as managing the business of being in a very well-known family.  Image: PA  Eugenie is the Queen’s granddaughter and there is nothing at odds with her getting married at Windsor Castle.  The Queen is expected to attend with almost all other senior members of the Royal Family – and hundreds or thousands of well-wishers – so it stands to reason there will be proper security.  Against: Why all this trouble for a minor royal?  Dai Davies  Ex head of Royal Protection  The fact that the Queen and senior royals will be there is the reason nothing will be left the chance, as well as protecting the crowds.  I think the question should be asked about why is this expense and trouble being afforded to such a minor royal like Princess Eugenie.  Image: PA  Princess Anne’s children have all managed superbly well without any fanfare at all and I can’t imagine many people will be in support of it.  The carriage ride through the streets is a potential problem.  I’m not sure who would have thought this would be a good idea, certainly none of those planning the operation would have encouraged it.

e3cbd113	The government has published an analysis of the UK's options if it left the EU - suggesting they would all be worse for the economy than staying in.    Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the aim was to smoke out Leave campaigners who had avoided spelling out their vision of a post-EU Britain.    The document says the UK would lose influence and exporters could be hit with damaging tariffs.    But Leave campaigners said the dodgy dossier was misleading.        Follow the latest EU referendum and Prime Ministers's Questions updates      The UK's EU vote: All you need to know    Iain Duncan Smith - one of five cabinet ministers campaigning in favour of a vote to leave the EU - said it misrepresented the Leave case by suggesting Britain could follow the example of other non-EU countries, such as Norway or Switzerland.    He said: The truth is, we won't copy any other country's deal. We will have a settlement on our own terms - and one that will return control of our borders, and money to Britain. That's the safer choice.    He said the government was in denial about the risk of remaining a member of the EU. This dodgy dossier won't fool anyone, he said, adding that the real uncertainty is the future of the EU project.    Cabinet ministers are allowed to campaign freely on either side of the debate, but the official government position is in favour of staying in a reformed EU in the 23 June referendum.  line  Four post exit options  UK and EU flagsimage copyrightReuters        Norway model: Member of European Economic Area, full access to single market, obliged to make a financial contribution and accept majority of EU laws, free movement applies as it does in the EU      Swiss model: Member of the European Free Trade Association but not the European Economic Area, access to EU market governed by series of bilateral agreements, covers some but not all areas of trade, also makes a financial contribution but smaller than Norway's, doesn't have a general duty to apply EU laws but does have to implement some EU regulations to enable trade, free movement applies      Free Trade Agreement: Deal would be negotiated after UK voted to leave, generally mean low tariffs on goods but trade in services is usually more limited, exact obligations would depend on depth of agreement: the more comprehensive, the more co-operation there would be on standards, regulations, etc, no free movement or financial contribution unless they were part of the specific agreement      World Trade Organisation rules: WTO sets rules for international trade that apply to all members, no free movement or financial contribution, no obligation to apply EU laws although traded goods would still have to meet EU standards, some tariffs would be in place on trade with the EU, trade in services would be restricted    line    The document says Norway and Switzerland's trading arrangements outside the EU require them to make financial contributions, accept the EU principle of free movement of people and be subject to other EU laws.    Meanwhile, Switzerland and Canada's arrangements provide only limited access to the single market, it adds.    In a speech in London, Mr Hammond said Britain would be locked in talks with the EU for two years after an exit, while our competitors, including our EU competitors, forge ahead.    He said there was no guarantee the UK could reach a deal within the two year limit, and talks could drag on for many years because there would be no goodwill from member states to help the UK get a deal.    He claimed Leave campaigners had deliberately avoided sketching out what a post-exit trade deal would look like because there were no credible options that come close to the deal we already have on the table that had been negotiated by David Cameron.  media captionCould Norway model work for UK?    Mr Hammond said Leave campaigners should be honest with voters and say they are prepared to sacrifice jobs and growth in order to get a clampdown on migration, in order to stop paying into the EU.    He said he hoped the dossier would force Leave campaigners to put some flesh on the bones of their vision of a post EU Britain.    The official government analysis of UK membership of the EU is required by law under the EU Referendum Act, which paved the way for the in-out referendum on EU membership.  'Analysis flawed'    If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would then be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by penalties or sparking a trade war.    The government paper runs through examples of other countries, such as Norway, Switzerland and Canada, who have trade deals with the EU without being members - as well as the option of breaking free from the EU altogether and striking deals with individual countries through the World Trade Organisation.    These scenarios have been mentioned by anti-EU campaigners in the past.    Speaking to the BBC, Norway's prime minister, Erna Solberg, said she would like her country to be part of the EU because it lacked influence over important decision making and had basically... left part of our democracy to Europe.    Asked if she thought Britain could retain access to the single market without being subject to free movement of people, she said: To believe you'll get everything you want without giving something back does not happen in any political body.  Vote Leave campaignersimage copyrightGetty Images  image captionFive cabinet ministers, including Mr Duncan Smith, are campaigning against the government in favour of an EU exit    The government paper says they each carry serious risks for business - but Leave campaigners say the analysis is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of a bespoke trade deal between the UK and the EU, with no tariffs or trade barriers.    Gerard Lyons, of investment managers Black Rock and chief economic adviser to London mayor and Leave campaigner Boris Johnson, said it would be a shock for both sides if Britain left but it would be in the EU's interest to reach a trade deal with the UK as it was one of the EU's biggest export markets.    Meanwhile, Lord Lamont has become the latest Conservative grandee to nail his colours to one side or other of the EU debate.    Lord Lamont, who was chancellor in the early 1990s when Britain crashed out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, is calling for Britain to leave, arguing in the Daily Telegraph that the country could succeed economically and would regain control of immigration.

1aff43d1	The Mail today launches a campaign to save Britain's high streets – after a staggering 50,000 retail jobs were axed in the first half of this year.  The figures expose the bloodbath up and down the country as hundreds of stores – from major chains to small shops – shut their doors.  Business leaders, shopkeepers and MPs blame punitive business rates that cripple high streets and hand a huge advantage to internet giants.  Today chief executives of some of the country's biggest chains, along with politicians from all parties, demand reform as they warn that sky-high rates are stifling investment and driving long-established companies to the wall.  The Mail is launching a campaign to save Britain's high street after 50,000 retail jobs were axed  Last year shops closed at a rate of 16 every day. Figures compiled by the Press Association show that between January and June this year, 50,000 jobs were either lost or expected to go.  In recent months the trail of destruction has hit household names including House of Fraser – which has put 6,000 jobs under threat – and Poundworld, which plunged into administration endangering a further 5,100.  Toys R Us and Maplin collapsed, while chains such as Prezzo, Byron and Jamie's Italian shut restaurants and culled hundreds of jobs.  Meanwhile, the taxman is raking in more and more from business rates – with a total haul of £30.8 billion predicted this year, up from £29.6 billion last year.  The vast majority comes from major retailers in the heart of towns and cities, while online stores and out-of-town shopping centres pay much less in both rates and corporation tax.  Critics say high business rates which force firms to go bust are self-defeating, as they reduce tax revenues.  Marks & Spencer, which is closing more than 100 stores in the next four years with hundreds of jobs at risk, told the Mail that rising rates were partly to blame for its drastic plans.  Chief executive Steve Rowe said: 'Business rates are an unfair burden of taxation directly contributing to the challenges the high street is facing. The long-term effects of these charges are now a reality.  'Our Covent Garden store faced a rate rise of close to a half a million pounds in the year before it closed, an untenable position for any retailer.  Today chief executives of some of the country's biggest chains, along with politicians from all parties, demand reform as they warn that sky-high rates are stifling investment and driving long-established companies to the wall  'These challenges will continue until the system is reformed to create a level playing field between high street and online retailers.'  Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis said: 'UK retail is the most employment-dense sector of the economy, so constantly losing businesses in the way we are will have an economic impact.  'And so if they're not careful the Government risk taking too much out of business rates and then losing in the medium term.'  Labour MP Frank Field, chairman of the Commons work and pensions committee, said: 'The taxation of online retailers and firms which funnel their profits abroad should be changed now.  'A specific sales tax should be put on those firms that compete against the high street and barely pay a penny to the Government. Reform is long overdue.'  Senior Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg said: 'Business rates have not kept up with economic change.  High street shops are penalised while online sellers face lower charges giving them another competitive advantage.'  Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said: 'This is a very important and welcome campaign.  Last year shops closed at a rate of 16 every day. Figures compiled by the Press Association show that between January and June this year, 50,000 jobs were either lost or expected to go  'There must be a level playing field and this campaign would be a significant step to achieving that.'  Business rates are based on the estimated rental value of a property. It means that traditional retailers such as department stores with large premises in town and city centres are hit particularly hard, while newer internet rivals such as Amazon pay far less.  Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said one in five of his organisation's members had thought about closing down or selling up because of the pressure from business rates.  He said: 'Along with spiralling rents, increasing labour costs and weakening consumer demand, rising business rates bills are threatening high streets across the country.  'Business rates are an unfair and regressive tax, which hit firms before they've made their first penny in turnover, let alone profit.'  Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, added: 'The broken business rates system puts pressure on firms of all shapes and sizes, taking no account of economic circumstances or business performance.  'In this climate of sluggish growth and weak investment, a system which saps funds and undermines firms' investment potential is particularly jarring.'  The Institute of Directors and Confederation of British Industry also backed calls for reform.  Business leaders, shopkeepers and MPs blame punitive business rates that cripple high streets and hand a huge advantage to internet giants  Meanwhile, pub and restaurant bosses say rates have made it hard to survive in an industry where profits have always been tight and rising inflation has put them under even more pressure.  Experts say 2018 will go down in history as the 'year of the Company Voluntary Arrangement' – an insolvency procedure used to push through several store closure programmes this year.  Robert Hayton, head of UK business rates at Altus Group, said: 'Business rates are rarely the sole driver for insolvencies but certainly a contributory factor, with bills having risen by more than a fifth through inflation during the seven years before last year's revaluation.  'Add that to the lethal cocktail of other increased operating costs for the national living wage and apprenticeship levy and it creates the perfect storm.'  The Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank says business rates should be torn up and replaced with a new system where the value of the land itself is taxed, rather than the buildings on top of it.  Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said: 'Government ministers will weep crocodile tears about the situation, but it is government policy that is partly to blame, given the lamentable failure of the Government to shift the unfair burden of business rates away from hard-pressed high street retailers and find a way of taxing online retailers more effectively.'

a8ecc454	The number of children needing foster care has risen by 44% during the coronavirus pandemic while the number of people looking to become foster parents plummeted by nearly half compared to the same period last year, according to the UK’s leading children’s charity.  From March 1st - April 23rd 2020, there were 2,349 referrals to Barnardo’s fostering services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a figure which shot up from 1,629 for the same period in 2019. Meanwhile the number of enquiries from people looking to become foster parents for the charity fell from 302 to 161 - a dramatic 47% drop.  Barnardo’s says this has created a ‘state of emergency’ as children who may have experienced abuse and neglect wait for places with loving foster families. Without more potential foster carers coming forward, hundreds of children referred to Barnardo’s will not be placed with a family.  The UK’s leading children’s charity believes that the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown has increased pressure on vulnerable families, with job losses, deepening poverty and worsening mental health all leading to family breakdown. Children have also been in lockdown in homes where domestic abuse and sexual abuse are taking place. These pressures will likely impact more families as the crisis continues.  At the same time Barnardo’s believes that the change in circumstances experienced by many because of COVID-19 and uncertainty about the future has resulted in a drop in enquiries being made to the charity from people looking to foster.  Barnardo’s is calling on people over 21, who have a spare room and the time and commitment to support a child to get in touch and consider fostering a child. Barnardo’s welcomes foster carers from all walks of life, including single people, those from the LGBTQ+ community and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic backgrounds.  The charity also wants to make it clear that foster carers will be supported every step of the way by Barnardo’s, and will also be eligible for financial support including carers’ allowance.  To find out more about fostering with Barnardo’s, go to https://www.barnardos.org.uk/foster or call 07712402312 or 0800 0277 280.  Barnardo’s Chief Executive Javed Khan said:  “The Coronavirus pandemic has hit vulnerable families the hardest, with many reaching crisis point. This has created a state of emergency, as more children than ever need a safe and loving foster family, while fewer adults are coming forward as potential foster carers.  “Barnardo’s has over 100 years’ experience bringing vulnerable children together with loving foster families, who provide the vital love and support children need to thrive. If you become a foster carer with Barnardo’s we will support you every step of the way with training and a dedicated social worker. You’ll also receive financial support, including a carer’s allowance.  “Today, there are hundreds of children who have been referred to Barnardo’s and are waiting to be placed with a foster family. If you’re over 21, have a spare room and the time and commitment to support a child in need, please do consider getting in touch today.”  ENDS  Case study  Nichol Garcia is 50 and has been a full-time foster carer for the past nine years. She lives in Nottingham with her teenage son and three foster children.  Nichol says: “I felt I had space in my heart and life for more children, and after talking to my family and most importantly, my son, I got in touch with Barnardo’s and have not regretted it since. I’ve done so many different things in my life, but foster caring is by far the best thing I’ve ever done.”  Over the past nine years, Nichol and her son have fostered 11 young people, mainly teenagers but also younger children, most of whom have stayed with them for long periods of time.  “I was worried I would feel upset when the children left, as I invest so much into each child, but we keep in touch with all of them as they are a part of our family now and we sometimes meet up too. I am a part of their history and they are a part of mine.”  Nichol acknowledges that fostering has its share of challenges too.  She says: “Sometimes children may have had difficult experiences and need additional support such as therapy to help them make sense of what they’ve been through, and it’s important for foster carers to support them with this. I really fight for all of my foster children and young people to get them what they deserve.”  Nichol believes that the constant support and ongoing training offered by Barnardo’s has enabled her to deal with any difficult periods.  “My social worker from Barnardo’s is like a professional friend,” Nichol says. “I meet with her regularly, but if I ever need any advice or support, day or night, there is always someone there to give me everything I need. There is always lots of different training on offer too, and I go on several courses each year.  “Before you are approved to foster, Barnardo’s does some really intense training to ensure potential foster carers are fully aware of what they may experience. They don’t just have the child’s best interests at heart, but also the foster carer’s too.”  Nichol’s advice to anyone who is considering fostering is this: “If you go into foster caring for the wrong reasons, you won’t last long. It’s not always easy, but it is the most rewarding thing you can ever do. For those who already have their own children and may be worried about whether fostering is the right decision for them, in my experience, by keeping my child involved every step of the way, he loves it just as much as I do and we wouldn’t have it any other way now.  “Some of my favourite times are when we all sit outside together chatting around the log burner and I feel really lucky to have them all and love seeing them so happy.”  Notes to Editors  Data shows the number of fostering referrals and enquiries to Barnardo’s from people looking to become foster carers from March 1 - April 23 in 2019 and 2020 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland only.  About Barnardo’s  Last year around 300,000 children, young people, parents and carers were supported by Barnardo’s through more than 1,000 services across the UK, such as young carers, care leavers, foster carers and adoptive parents, training and skills or parenting classes.  We work to change the lives of vulnerable children in the UK and every year we help thousands of families to build a better future. But we cannot do it without you.

5225b538	Hospitals have axed 15,000 beds in just six years, leaving wards at ‘breaking point’, a shock report reveals today.  The dramatic reduction – equivalent to closing 24 hospitals – amounts to a 10 per cent fall in NHS beds at a time when the health service is under unprecedented pressure.  There are now just 129,458 hospital beds available for patients at night, down from 144,455 in 2010/11.  Critics say patients’ safety is at risk and blame the cuts on an NHS obsession with shifting care out of hospitals and ‘closer to home’.  The dramatic reduction – equivalent to closing 24 hospitals – amounts to a 10 per cent fall in NHS beds at a time when the health service is under unprecedented pressure  Health officials say patients recover more quickly if they are looked after in their own homes by GPs, district nurses and carers, but many surgeries and councils do not have the resources to care for people who would previously have stayed longer in hospital.  At the same time, demand for beds is soaring due to the pressures of a social care crisis, immigration and an ageing population, with many more patients succumbing to long-term illnesses and frailty.  New figures today will suggest the problem is likely to get worse. Regulator NHS Improvement will warn that despite being given a £1.8 billion cash injection from the Government last year, hospitals are on course for a £1 billion deficit by the end of this year.  The figures will spark a fresh debate about whether the NHS is contributing to its problems by squandering precious resources.  One report yesterday said hospitals had blown £2 billion by overpaying for items such as toilet roll, blinds and wet wipes, with items that could have been sent in one hospital’s internal mail being sent by Royal Mail instead.  The British Medical Association BMA warned that the loss of 15,000 beds ‘risked patient safety’ because nothing had been done to improve the level of care at home.  The lack of beds means hospitals are having to cancel operations at the last minute – including cancer and heart surgery – or send patients home before they have properly recovered.  Hospitals have axed 15,000 beds in just six years, leaving wards at ‘breaking point’, a shock report reveals today  The BMA report also highlights how the NHS has fewer beds per head than nearly every country in Europe  The BMA report also highlights how the NHS has fewer beds per head than nearly every country in Europe. The UK has an average of 2.4 beds per 1,000 population, compared to Germany 8, Austria 7.5 and France 6.  And it raises concerns over occupancy rates on wards. Hospitals are not meant to be more than 85 per cent occupied, but the report highlights figures showing that nine out of ten exceeded this over the winter. Several hospitals are 99 or even 100 per cent occupied with patients at much higher risk of infections and neglect.  Last week an inquest heard that grandmother Mary Muldowney, 57, from Crawley, West Sussex, died from a brain haemorrhage after three hospitals refused to admit her because they had no beds.  Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the BMA’s council, said: ‘These figures paint an even bleaker picture of an NHS that is at breaking point.  Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the BMA’s council, said: ‘These figures paint an even bleaker picture of an NHS that is at breaking point'  ‘High bed occupancy is a symptom of wider pressure and demand on an overstretched and underfunded system. It causes delays in admissions, operations being cancelled and patients being unfairly and sometimes repeatedly let down.  'The delays that vulnerable patients are facing, particularly those with mental health issues, have almost become the norm and this is unacceptable.’  The bed shortage is being exacerbated by the bed-blocking crisis, caused by the problems in the social care sector. With a shortage of home help and places at residential care homes, elderly and vulnerable patients are staying in hospital longer than they should.  Former health minister, Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb, said: ‘The situation is getting intolerable, with more cancelled operations, longer delays and those with mental health issues being systematically let down. The Government is failing to properly fund the NHS and patients are paying the price.’  Today’s figures cover all hospital beds, including those on general and maternity wards, as well as in mental health and learning disability centres. An average hospital has 634 beds, so a loss of 15,000 beds is equivalent to almost 24 hospitals.  Fiona Johnson, of the Nuffield Trust think-tank, said: ‘The extremely high level of bed occupancy in England’s hospitals creates pressure-cooker conditions for the NHS.  ‘The drive to achieve efficiencies by reducing bed numbers has become counterproductive, as there is no slack in the system to accommodate surges in demand and as a result procedures and operations get delayed.’  Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘The shameful reality is this overcrowding puts patients at risk and blows apart ministers’ claims to be prioritising safety.’  FAMILY DOCTORS ARE OFFERING FIVE-MINUTE APPOINTMENTS Family doctors are offering patients urgent appointments lasting only five minutes in a bid to meet soaring demand. A snapshot survey found several surgeries offering the same-day slots for anyone who thinks they need to be seen immediately. This includes parents worried about sick children or patients with chest pain or breathing difficulties. GP appointments in England usually last ten minutes and are already among the shortest in Europe. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, of the British Medical Association, said: ‘Five minutes is woefully too short. 'Nine out of ten GPs say they cannot manage in ten-minute appointments.’ Advertisement  An NHS England spokesman said: ‘Modern treatment advances such as minimally invasive surgery, fast-acting anaesthetics and medicines taken at home mean that the length of time patients spend in hospital has been falling in all Western countries.  ‘The NHS is highly efficient overall, but there are still meaningful differences in discharge practices and community support across England.’  The Department of Health said: Our hospitals are busier than ever but thanks to the hard work of staff, our performances are still among the best in the world. We have backed the NHS’s own plan for the future with an extra £10 billion by 2020.’	NHS cuts 15,000 beds in six years	other

The Prime Minister has come under fire in recent days, with calls for Britain to accept a greater number of Syrian refugees in the wake of the unprecedented amount of migrant tragedies in the Mediterranean. His decision to take in more refugees from camps on the borders of war-torn Syria came shortly after heartbreaking photos of two dead Syrian boys washed up on a Turkish beach began circulating online. Mr Cameron said he was “deeply moved” by the pictures and blamed their deaths on the Islamic State ISIS, criminal gangs and Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad.  Speaking today, he said: As a father and as a human being you cannot help but be moved by these terrible pictures, seeing the picture of that poor child on the beach in Turkey. Those images will remain with all of us for a very very long time. But the question you have to ask not just as a father but as a Prime Minister is what are the actions we can take that will really make a difference? That is why, in taking additional refugees, because of course every one we take we can offer a new chance and a new life to, I think it is important we take them from Syrian refugee camps. I want to send the message out that the best way to get a new life is not to make this perilous journey.  AP Tima Kurdi, touches a photo of her nephews Aylan and Galib Kurdi  Downing Street declined to put a precise figure on the number of Syrians who will be admitted to the country, saying that details of the scheme were being finalised and will be announced next week. The additional £100million funding pledge for refugee camps on Syria's borders brings the total contribution from the UK to more than £1billion, making it Britain's largest ever response to a humanitarian crisis, said Mr Cameron. As Europe struggles to deal with what is the greatest migrant crisis in its history, a dramatic East-West split has formed as the EU. Brussels, Germany and France want to force all EU nations - including Britain - to take their share of up to 160,000 refugees. But Hungary, which has borne the brunt of a recent influx of migrants, and Poland are steadfastly refusing to accept any more, insisting it is not their problem. The remarks from Mr Cameron came as French President Francois Hollande delivered a thinly-veiled swipe at the UK by complaining that some countries were not “shouldering their moral obligations”. France and Germany had earlier agreed to propose a permanent and mandatory system to take in refugees and asylum seekers, especially Syrians, in the European Union EU. “I believe that today what we have done is not enough,” Mr Hollande said in Paris. “There are countries - I am not going to name them here because we are here to work with everybody - and these countries are not shouldering their moral obligations.”  REUTERS Desperate migrant family on the tracks at Bicske, in Hungary, yesterday  Announcing the migrant agreement German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: “The French-German position, which we will transmit to the European institutions, is that we agree that we need binding quotas within the European Union to share the burden. That is the principle of solidarity.” She said the “economic power and size of countries should play a role” in the number of migrants they are asked to take in, but stressed that without quotas, “we cannot solve this problem.” It also emerged that EU leaders have drawn up a plan to relocate 160,000 refugees around the Continent.    Under the new scheme, masterminded by European Commission EC President Jean-Claude Juncker, migrants stranded in Italy, Greece and Hungary will be transferred to countries across the EU based on their population and economic wealth. It will see Germany granting asylum to 35,000 refugees, France accepting 26,000 and Spain 16,000. Bulgaria and Romania will be expected to take thousands of families. Britain refused to join up to scheme earlier this year. However, splits were already emerging over the plan. EC President Donald Tusk admitted there was a “divide between the east and the west of the EU” over the plan to force all countries to accept a share of the refugees.

But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who was holding talks with Mr Tusk, said that the flow of migrants was a “German problem”. “The problem is not a European problem, the problem is a German problem. Nobody would like to stay in Hungary, neither in Slovakia nor Poland nor Estonia. All of them would like to go to Germany,” he said. He told critics to stop blaming Hungary for the crisis and said that his country’s decision to force refugees to register meant it was just obeying EU rules before adding that Europeans were “full of fear because they see that the European leaders ... are not able to control the situation.” “Hungary did everything to fulfil regulations,” Mr Orban said. “Don’t criticise Hungary for doing what is compulsory.” The pugnacious Right-wing politician also argued that Europe’s open-door policy was fuelling the crisis. “If we would create ... an impression that ‘just come because we are ready to accept everybody’, that would be a moral failure. The moral, human thing is to make clear: Please don’t come,” he said. “Turkey is a safe country. Stay there. It’s risky to come.

59a9ea73	he Duke and Duchess of Sussex's home was renovated with £2.4m of taxpayer-funded costs, royal accounts show.  Frogmore Cottage in Windsor was turned into a single property for Prince Harry and Meghan, from five separate homes.  The couple, who moved from Kensington Palace in April before the birth of their son Archie, paid for fittings.  The Queen's Sovereign Grant from the Treasury was £82m in 2018-19, with £33m set aside for maintenance, including major work on Buckingham Palace.  The Sovereign Grant is funded by profits from the Crown Estate.  The estate is the Royal Family's commercial property arm and owns land and buildings in prime central London locations and across the UK. It is managed by an independent organisation, with any profit paid to the Treasury for the benefit of all UK taxpayers.  Separate accounts show the Crown Estate provided a record £343.5m to the Treasury in 2018-19, up 4.3% on last year. 'Our responsibility'  The royal accounts said the renovation of Frogmore Cottage was paid out of the Sovereign Grant and involved the reconfiguration and full refurbishment of five residential units in poor condition to create the official residence for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.  The 19th Century, Grade II-listed, property was given to them by the Queen.  It sits in the grounds of royal residence Frogmore House, where Prince Harry and Meghan held their wedding reception in May 2018.      Who lived in Harry and Meghan's house?     Harry and Meghan split from royal charity     Harry and Meghan move to Windsor     MPs back £369m Buckingham Palace revamp  Defective wooden ceiling beams and floor joists were replaced and inefficient heating systems updated. The house also required extensive rewiring - including an electrical sub-station - and the installation of gas and water mains.  The refurbishment took about six months although some areas are yet to be completed, such as repainting the exterior.  Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, said: The property had not been the subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation in line with our responsibility to maintain the condition of the occupied royal palaces estate.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also carried out renovations before moving into their Kensington Palace home in 2013, spending more than £4m on converting offices into an apartment. Taxpayer-funded spending on the royals has been a sensitive topic for decades.  That's why Palace officials went out of their way to explain how much had to be done to Frogmore Cottage, and how anything over basic fixtures and fittings would be paid for by the couple themselves.  The Sovereign Grant is to cover the cost of official duties and for the upkeep of royal palaces.  However, some will ask, why did the couple have to move out of Kensington Palace?  And why, if they felt that strongly about it, didn't they pay for the refurbishment of the house in Windsor themselves? Presentational grey line  The Royal Family's core sovereign grant is based on 15% of the net surplus of the Crown Estate, and allocated two years in arrears.  From 2017-18, the total grant was increased to 25% of the surplus for a 10-year period - with the extra funding intended to meet the £369m costs of refurbishing Buckingham Palace.  Excluding money transferred to reserves for future building work at the palace, the Queen's official expenses last year were £67m, a 41% year-on-year increase, the figures show.  A large amount of the rise was due to the ongoing renovation at Buckingham Palace, and work on the other occupied royal residences.  The campaign group Republic questioned why money had been spent on Frogmore Cottage at a time while public services were under financial pressure.  Graham Smith, from Republic, called for a parliamentary inquiry into royal spending, adding: The general funds of the Treasury should not be spent on individual members of the royal family at all - even if we had all the money to spend on public services it should not be happening. Presentational grey line What is the Crown Estate?

The report said there was a 98% increase in carbon emissions from flights used on official royal visits overseas in 2018-19 - going up to 3,344 tonnes of CO2 from 1,687.  Buckingham Palace said the rise was due to higher usage of chartered large fixed wing aircraft for foreign business travel, adding there was five such overseas visits in 2018-19 compared to one the previous year.  The trips are decided by the Foreign Office.  The accounts also reveal the Duke of Edinburgh maintains an office with a private secretary and receives £359,000 annuity from the Treasury. Despite retiring from public duties in 2017, Prince Philip has an official relationship with hundreds of organisations and charities,  Separately, the Prince of Wales pays for the public duties of Prince Harry and Meghan and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and some of their private costs, out of his Duchy of Cornwall income, which was £21.6m last year.  Accounts from Clarence House show this funding - in the year Meghan officially joined the Royal Family - stood at just over £5m, up 1.8% on 2017-18. The figure also included some of Prince Charles's capital expenditure and transfer to reserves.  	Harry and Meghan's home renovations cost £2.4m in taxpayer funds	true
1c068671	Pressure on the government to help struggling Britons has intensified after a leading thinktank warned that falling living standards for the poor threatened the biggest rise in inequality since Margaret Thatcher was prime minister.  The Resolution Foundation said Theresa May would need to make good on her pledge to support “just about managing” households as it released a report showing that rising inflation and an end to recent strong jobs growth would hit the least well-off hardest.  Its warnings chime with other forecasts for a squeeze on family budgets on the back of sluggish wage growth, welfare cuts, rising global oil prices and the pound’s sharp fall since the Brexit vote. The drop in sterling has made imports more expensive and there are already signs that is being passed on to consumers, with inflation hitting its highest level for more than two years in December.  The Resolution Foundation’s study found that the current parliament would be the worst for living standards for the poorest half of households since comparable records began in the mid-1960s and the worst since the early years of Thatcher’s 1979-90 premiership for inequality.  Since its sharp increase in the early 1980s – a period of high unemployment, factory closures and a cut in the top rate of tax from 83% to 60% – inequality has broadly remained flat.  But the Resolution Foundation forecast that between 2015 and the next general election in 2020 incomes for the poorest half of households will fall by 2%.  That compares with a rise of 4% during the last parliament and 1% between 2005 and 2010 – the five-year period that included the deepest recession since the 1930s.    Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said: “Britain has enjoyed a welcome mini-boom in living standards in recent years. But that boom is slowing rapidly as inflation rises, productivity flatlines and employment growth slows.  “The squeeze in the wake of the financial crisis tended to hit richer households the most. But this time around it’s low- and middle-income families with kids who are set to be worst affected.  “This could leave Britain with the worst of both worlds on living standards – the weak income growth of the last parliament and rising inequality from the time Margaret Thatcher was in Downing Street.  “The prime minister’s focus on supporting just managing families is absolutely right if we are to avoid the next few years being like the 1980s without the feelgood factor.”  The prediction that inequality is set to start rising again is based on the thinktank’s forecast that while incomes will fall for the poorer half of households they will rise by about 5% for the richest fifth over the next four years.  The foundation blames the upcoming living standards squeeze on a combination of stagnating pay, rising inflation and the rollout of more than £12bn of welfare cuts. It emphasised that the pound’s weakness since the Brexit vote and other economic factors such as flat productivity growth were only part of the picture. The unequal nature of the squeeze would be the result of government policy on tax and benefits.    “The vote to leave the European Union does not, thus far, appear to have impacted on the macroeconomy or employment, but it has hastened the end of ultra-low inflation and increased how far it is likely to rise in the next few years,” the report said.  “But, in some ways regardless of the average level of household income growth, Britain is also actively choosing to increase inequality. Despite welcome policies such as the national living wage, the plans the new prime minister has inherited are likely to ensure that the proceeds of growth are shared unequally and many families made worse off.”    The thinktank sees inequality rising to record highs by 2020 on three different measures: the 90:10 income ratio, which is the income of a household 90% up the income distribution scale, divided by that of a household only 10% of the way up; on the 80:20 ratio, calculated in a similar way from those 80% up the distribution and those 20% up; and on the Palma ratio, the income share of the top 10% divided by the income share of the bottom 40%.  “All forecast measures show large increases in inequality over the next four years, with all reaching record highs by 2020-21. This is a starkly different pattern from the trend of the past 20 years, over which time inequality has been broadly flat or even declining,” the report said.    Underscoring the challenge for May’s government as it seeks to redress deep regional imbalances in the UK, the Resolution Foundation also highlighted persistent inequalities between south-east England and the rest of the country.  Incomes in the vast majority of the country were more than 10% lower than in most wealthy region, south-east England, its analysis found. North-east England and the West Midlands had the lowest levels of income, both 20% lower than in the south-east.  On the capital, the report added: “Contrary perhaps to received wisdom London is not the region with the highest income, and once housing costs are taken into account, incomes in the region are roughly 10% lower than in the south-east.”  A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “Living standards reached their highest ever level in 2015, and are forecast to be higher still by the end of the parliament.    “Millions of people are taking home more of what they earn thanks to the government’s actions to reduce income tax bills and introduce the national living wage. We are helping households with the cost of living by increasing the supply of affordable housing, banning letting agents’ fees, and freezing fuel duty, and our investment to boost productivity will raise living standards in the long run.”  John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the Resolution Foundation was damning: “Labour called on the government at the autumn statement to end the unfair cuts to in work benefits, while they were going ahead with tax giveaways to a wealthy minority, but Philip Hammond chose to carry on with the work of his predecessor.  “It is becoming clearer by the day that working families will be forced to pay for a Tory Brexit that favours the rich and not the rest of us, as our country faces its biggest rise in inequality since Margaret Thatcher.”	UK faces return to inequality of Thatcher years, says report	other
2574e017	  Doc calls for a return to negotiations By DR JONATHAN STANLEY 12th January 2016, 12:01 am Updated: 6th April 2016, 9:54 am  TODAY my colleagues are going out on strike.  It is unprecedented, threatens patients’ dignity and safety — and it is unnecessary.  For me, it’s also illegal. That’s why today, I’m calling — along with think tank the Bow Group — for the British Medical Association BMA to call off its strikes and return to negotiations to bag the settlement we all need.  Savvy tactics from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt led to the Government going in too hard in talks none of us can walk away from.  That’s why a ballot was held.  But even back in November there was no reason why the BMA couldn’t have gone to mediators Acas first before upping the ante.  No one can honestly say that doctors, or the conditions on offer, are the same as what they were when the ballot was called. For me, the strike mandate ended when Acas talks started.  READ MORE:  Corbyn’s mob in doc strike as Momentum sends lefties to join picket line  Strike by junior doctors could drag on ‘for months’, says union boss  Moet medics: High life of docs’ leaders who are heading up NHS strike  Just days before the current talks broke down we all saw BMA reps briefing the media about how badly the whole thing was going.  Union bigwigs close to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn turned up the heat and the talks, naturally, collapsed.  With little chance of Labour returning to power any time soon we are now seeing Corbyn’s “new kind of politics” — a return to direct action to undermine the Government come what may.  His friends inside my union are leveraging the trust and goodwill we’ve spent years building and are weaponising my colleagues and our patients.  There has been no attention given to the victims of recent floods, who have lost so much and had operations cancelled.  With these strikes going ahead it is nonsense to say we can diagnose and treat cancers on time or that we can continue to see those suffering with mental health problems.  And it is nonsense to say the whole profession is behind the strikes — so many grades weren’t even balloted.  There are many different voices saying how many patients may die from understaffing over weekends and over these strikes.  The research I’ve worked on with the Bow Group suggests that more than two hundred lives could be lost just over the three days of industrial action this month.  There is our human side to this debate too. Thousands of us have worked hard to get into medicine.  We see so many patients suffer from their illnesses and are privileged to be there to help them as best we can.  I’ve worked as a doctor since 2005. I see the devastation when an operation is delayed, the anguish when a cancer is picked up late.  Paying me any more or working me any less will never blunt what I see.  Fair wages are fair, and I support the BMA in arguing for them.  Talks collapse ... Dr Stanley blames Corbyn's 'new type of politics' for breakdown  Reuters 1  We all want fair pay through negotiation. But there are many aspects of safety the current talks haven’t even touched upon.  For example, changing our rotas so senior doctors can stay on two weeks more in August — when newly qualified doctors start — would help the new doctors begin their careers in a safer and more supportive environment.  I’m sick of hearing how my colleagues will leave the country if they don’t get all that they want, that they’ll somehow be forced on to a plane to the Great Barrier Reef.  No one is forcing anyone to do anything and we have a debt to repay.  Doctors are one in eight of all NHS staff but we get three-fifths of the training budget.  That’s great, of course, because we really do need the best training to treat you. But why can’t clawbacks be written into our contracts so that if we leave as consultants for warmer climes we must pay back our training?  It takes £400,000 to train a GP — and for surgeons and cardiologists it’s even more.  Two thousand senior doctors leaving the UK would cost us a billion. More than twice that number applied to work abroad just last year.  But with competition for training and for medical school so high, I have to admit we’ve been too easy on those wishing to walk off with the loot.  In fact, if we did close this loophole maybe Jeremy Hunt would have more money to spend on nurses, medicines and, yes, on increasing our pay too.  I have seen emails and briefings from BMA negotiators attacking the Government, calling Hunt a liar, calling for other unions and left-wing groups to join pickets.  I won’t breach confidentiality by publishing these documents, you’ll have to take my word for it.  These briefings are not in my name, and they don’t represent the views of most junior doctors I know.  They make it clear to me there are elements of the BMA that wanted a strike from the moment they got their ballot and have no intention of returning to talks.  Where does that leave the public?  Strikes, I fear, will increase in number and severity.  Maybe, in time for May’s local elections, Corbyn will ride to the rescue and save the day from the strikes he prompted. He may even reward some of his Labour friends inside the profession, but the end result will be a conspiracy against the public and the patients.  I support the BMA, I have been a member for ten years. It does vital work for doctors and, ultimately, serves all of our interests.  But it has allowed a few members with a radical left-wing agenda very different to the union’s own to hijack it.  I will lose friends in calling out this failure to avoid strikes where possible.  I remember my early days of training at Sheffield Medical School and its motto shines through: “The art is long and life is short.”  The standing, trust and legacy of the medical profession is bigger than this showdown — and it has to be. There is a difference between being a professional and an employee. This is an employee dispute, but we are professionals crucial to the life of the nation.  We need to start acting like it.  — Dr Jonathan Stanley is a junior doctor and a member of the Royal College of Surgeons.

9b14da53	Junior doctors in England have overwhelmingly voted in favour of going on strike in their dispute with ministers over a new contract.  Some 98% voted in favour of a full strike and 99% in favour of action just short of a full strike.  The first walk-out will start on 1 December with another two dates earmarked for later in the month.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the doctors' decision was very, very disappointing news.  And he rejected calls for talks to be held at conciliation service Acas, although he would not rule it out completely.  Study after study has shown that our mortality rates at weekends are too high, he said. media captionIn full: Jeremy Hunt interview with Laura Kuenssberg  We put forward a very fair offer for doctors, which will see pay go up for three-quarters of junior doctors. We wanted to talk about this to them, but in the end they have chosen to strike so we will have to put in contingency plans.  He also said that the government's offer had been misrepresented. 'Unsafe contract'  The British Medical Association BMA said it was inevitable disruption would be caused to patients as a result of the strikes, but maintained it had been left with no choice as the contract was unsafe.  The action is likely to lead to the cancelling and rescheduling of thousands of routine appointments, tests and operations with the NHS forced to prioritise emergency cases.  The union has asked the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service Acas to get involved to offer independent arbitration - something the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which normally stays out of politics, has said it supports.  The dates for industrial action are:      08:00 GMT 1 December to 08:00 GMT 2 December junior doctors to staff emergency care     08:00 GMT to 17:00 8 December full strike     08:00 GMT to 17:00 16 December full strike  The BMA balloted just over 37,700 members - over two-thirds of the workforce - and 76% took part in the ballot.  Paris attacks: The young doctor who treated first casualties line What will happen in a strike? Doctorimage copyrightPA  Services will be disrupted, make no mistake about that. But the British Medical Association argues the aim of doctors taking part will not be to maximise that - as is the goal in many other industrial disputes.  On the first day of action that has been earmarked, junior doctors will still staff emergency care. On the other two dates, they will walk out in the knowledge there will be other medics - consultants, staff doctors and locums - that can plug the gaps.  Whether that will be enough for hard-pressed emergency services will be argued over ahead, during and after any walkout.  What is certain, though, is routine services will suffer. Hip operations, knee replacement and routine clinics will have to be cancelled.  In fact, as happened the last time doctors took action in 2012, over pensions, expect hospitals to start rearranging services in advance. Want to know more about the dispute?      The junior doctors row explained     What exactly do junior doctors do?     A nightmare for the NHS and patients     How does your job compare?     NHS v ministers: A case of deja vu?  line  The vote comes after thousands of doctors have taken part in a series of protests in recent months in the contract dispute.  Talks broke down last year, and ministers have since said they will impose the new contract from next year.  As the ballot papers went out a fortnight ago, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt made a last ditch attempt to persuade doctors to accept the offer.  He wrote to all the doctors in the country with a fresh offer.  It included a promise of an 11% rise in basic pay, but the BMA said this was misleading as it was offset by curbs to other elements of the pay package, including unsociable hours payments.  Ministers have promised to protect pay for the first three years of the deal.  But the BMA has said there are insufficient safeguards to stop hospitals overworking doctors and they could lose out financially in the long term. Junior doctors row  55,000  junior doctors in England  37,700  balloted over industrial action      £3.1bn spent on junior doctor pay currently      11% rise in basic pay offered      25% cut in weekly hours that attract a premium unsociable hours payment  Source: Department of Health and BMA Science Photo Library  After the result of the ballot was announced, BMA leader Dr Mark Porter said: We regret the inevitable disruption that this will cause but it is the government's adamant insistence on imposing a contract that is unsafe for patients in the future, and unfair for doctors now and in the future, that has brought us to this point.  Our message to him is that junior doctors have today made their views perfectly clear but that it is still possible to get back around the negotiating table to deliver a contract that is safe for patients, contains the necessary contractual safeguards to prevent junior doctors being overworked and properly recognises evening and weekend work.  Meanwhile, Labour shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander has written to the prime minister to ask him to intervene, saying the profession had lost confidence in Mr Hunt. She also wants to see independent arbitration.  The letter - seen by the BBC - says: With the NHS facing its most difficult winter in recent memory, and the prospect of industrial action now looming, it is imperative that urgent steps are taken to resolve this dispute. Graphic  Roger Goss, of the campaign group Patient Concern, criticised the way both sides had handled the dispute but said doctors should not go on strike.  This is the worst news for patients in the history of the NHS. What happened to the promise that the interests of patients are paramount and we put patients first?  Any honourable doctor with a genuine vocation who wants to preserve the high esteem which the medical profession currently enjoys will refuse to cause suffering inherent in a full-scale walk-out.  Scotland and Wales have said they do not want to introduce the contract changes, while Northern Ireland has yet to make a decision.  	Junior doctors row: 98% vote in favour of strikes	partially false
9289000c	More Britons are in work than ever despite predictions of huge job losses in the event of a vote for Brexit.  Official figures released yesterday showed that employment is at a record high, with more than 2,000 people finding work every day.  The workforce has grown to 32.34million – the highest level since records began in 1971, according to the Office for National Statistics. The total has risen by 609,000 since the referendum of June 2016.  Official figures released yesterday showed that employment is at a record high, with more than 2,000 people finding work every day. Before the vote George Osborne claimed up to 820,000 jobs could be lost within two years if Britain chose to leave  Before the vote George Osborne claimed up to 820,000 jobs could be lost within two years if Britain chose to leave.  ‘These figures just show how ridiculous and discredited Project Fear is,’ said pro-Brexit Tory MP Andrew Bridgen. ‘Britain has nothing to fear from taking back control of its money, its borders and its laws.’  Sir Bill Cash, a fellow Conservative MP, said the figures showed Brexit was ‘a great opportunity’ that was being put at risk by diehard Remainers.  The ONS also said the number of European Union citizens working in Britain had gone up since the referendum.  Almost 2.37million had jobs in March – 155,000 more than in early 2016. And workers from outside the EU have risen by 235,000 over the past two years.  Yesterday’s report from the ONS raised hopes that the economic slowdown at the start of this year would be temporary. The economy grew by just 0.1 per cent in the first quarter while output per hour – a key measure of productivity – dropped by 0.5 per cent.  Almost 2.37million had jobs in March – 155,000 more than in early 2016. And workers from outside the EU have risen by 235,000 over the past two years  But Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ‘We can be proud of our record on jobs. The unemployment rate is at its lowest in over 40 years.’  John Longworth, the former head of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘Once again Project Fear has been trounced by the outstanding jobs figures.  ‘At the same time, we see that the German economy has slowed and unemployment remains unacceptably high in many EU countries.’  An extra 3.2million people have joined the workforce since the Tories came to power in coalition in 2010. Four in five men aged between 16 and 64 are now in work, the highest proportion since 1991. Unemployment has dropped to a 43-year low of 4.2 per cent – compared with 8.5 per cent in the eurozone.  Unemployment has dropped to a 43-year low of 4.2 per cent – compared with 8.5 per cent in the eurozone  The total fell by 46,000 over the first three months of the year to 1.42million – 116,000 lower than a year earlier.  An average of 2,189 jobseekers found work every day in the first three months of the year.  John Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: ‘The great British job-creating machine kicked back into life in the first quarter of 2018.  ‘All of this good news stands in marked contrast to the subdued GDP growth of just 0.1 per cent. This estimate could be revised up later. But productivity growth turned negative again after a couple of quarters when it seemed to be perking up. This may reflect the fact that the downturn in output due to the cold weather in the first quarter did not lead to job losses given that it was seen as a purely temporary setback.’  Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said the post-crisis jobs boom in the UK was a big achievement given persistent fears over the threat to jobs from technology and machines.  German growth falls The eurozone economy slowed sharply at the start of the year as Germany and France stumbled, official figures showed yesterday. Output in the single currency bloc rose by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter of the year following a 0.7 per cent increase in the previous three months. The region was held back by Germany and France – the engine rooms of the eurozone. Growth in Germany slowed from 0.6 per cent to 0.3 per cent in the first quarter. At the same time, the pace of expansion in France dropped from 0.7 per cent to 0.3 per cent. The figures, from official statistics agency Eurostat, fuelled fears that the recovery in the eurozone is running out of steam after a solid performance in 2017. And while unemployment in the UK has fallen to a 43-year low of 4.2 per cent, it remains stubbornly high at 8.5 per cent in the eurozone. Peter Vanden Houte, chief economist at banking group ING, said: ‘The weaker first quarter might be the new normal.’ The unemployment rate in France is 8.8 per cent, 11 per cent in Italy and 16.1 per cent in Spain. The average across the advanced world is 5.4 per cent. Advertisement  Esther McVey, the Work and Pensions Secretary, said: ‘Since 2010 we have seen 3.2million more people move into work right across the UK.  ‘Youth unemployment has fallen by over 40 per cent and the unemployment rate at its joint lowest since 1975. Today’s figures once again cement that turnaround, with a new employment rate record of 75.6 per cent, and on average over 1,000 people each and every day, since 2010, getting a job.  ‘With wages growing faster than inflation and increases in the personal tax allowance, not only are more people bringing home a pay packet but they are keeping more of their hard earned money for themselves and their families.’  The Bank of England believes the official growth figure of just 0.1 per cent in the first quarter will be revised up to 0.3 per cent over time.  Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the Ernst & Young Item Club, said: ‘The labour market figures suggests that the economy may not be as weak as some of the recent data suggest. It may fuel hopes that the economy can bounce back after GDP growth slowed in the first quarter.’  The ONS also said wages were rising at the fastest pace for nearly three years as businesses took on more staff.  Average pay rose 3 per cent to a record £484 a week in the year to March. It was the biggest rise since 2015 and ahead of inflation at 2.5 per cent.

87ad7cb5	Staying in the EU is the riskier option for the UK because it will be unable to control rising migration, Boris Johnson has warned.  The ex-London mayor said population growth was the biggest economic change in the UK for a century.  His fellow Leave campaigner Michael Gove said the EU was undermining our population's security.  David Cameron accused the Leave campaign of trying to peddle fantasy politics.  Remain campaigners also dismissed Mr Johnson's claim the UK would be unable to resist extra payment demands from Brussels as nonsense because EU leaders had already agreed the UK would not pay towards future bailouts.  The UK also had a veto over future budget increases, they added.      Follow the latest updates with BBC EU Referendum Live     Reality Check: Will the UK pay for future euro bailouts     David Cameron likens Brexit 'bomb under economy'     Pro-EU MPs 'consider single market move'  Vote Leave attempted to counter repeated warnings by the government about the consequences of leaving the EU at an event in Stratford-upon-Avon featuring Mr Johnson, Mr Gove and Labour MP Gisela Stuart where they set out what they said were risks of remaining.  Mr Johnson said the population growth was partly down to migration driven by the crisis in the eurozone and challenged the Remain side to spell out a plan for the pressure it was causing on housing and the NHS.  Labour MP and Remain campaigner Harriet Harman said these were the responsibility of the government, not the EU.  Mr Johnson also said his side was winning all the democratic points and that the Remain arguments were morally and practically and completely wrong. line EU Referendum Reality Check      Will the UK pay for future euro bailouts?     Are we giving £350m a week to Brussels?     How much does the EU Budget cost the UK?

Taking questions afterwards, he rejected the idea that David Cameron's renegotiation had secured protection for the UK from paying for future bailouts.  The deal has no legal basis at the moment and could be quite easily overridden, he said.  Mr Gove, the justice secretary, said the EU's borderless Schengen Zone - which the UK is not part of - actively abets terrorists.  He also said the policies of the single currency had led to the rise of extremist parties. line Analysis by Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor  For voters who are only just tuning into the EU referendum debate they might take one look and tune out again.  What they might see this morning - one side accusing the other of being a bunch of liars who you wouldn't trust to feed your cat, the other side claiming the others include bitter has-beens and a load of sneering patricians telling you they know best.  Political debate that, in some moments, isn't much more sophisticated than a bunch of school kids shouting pants on fire at each other in the playground.  Given this is one of the biggest choices we have made as a country for generations - I know that sounds trite but it is true - it's not exactly edifying to watch, and as happened during the wilder days of the Scottish referendum, this campaign is dabbling in a world where the truth is not a safe anchor.  Read more from Laura line  Vote Leave says new figures suggest the UK could face a £2.4bn extra bill soon after the referendum because of a backlog of unpaid bills and a delay in the review of the EU's budget.  But it faced a rebuke from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which responded after Mr Gove cited the think tank during a live Q&A on Sky News.  Speaking on Friday night, Mr Gove said: There are billions of pounds that we send to the European Union every year and the IFS has pointed out that if we took that money back, we could spend it on the NHS, we could use it to reduce VAT on fuel.  The IFS issued a statement saying the UK's net contribution to the EU would be eclipsed by even a small damage to the public finances caused by leaving.  It added: That is why we conclude that leaving the EU would not, as Michael Gove claims we said, leave more money to spend on the NHS. Rather it would leave us spending less on public services, or taxing more, or borrowing more.  At a separate event on Monday, which Britain Stronger in Europe called an unprecedented display of cross-party support, Mr Cameron, Ms Harman, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said refusing to set out an economic plan for Brexit was reckless and undemocratic.  They said: It's time for the Leave campaign to outline their economic plan for Britain outside Europe.  They are perpetuating an economic con-trick on the British people, and we're calling time on it. The British public deserve better than being asked to roll the dice.  They also unveiled a dossier on the often contradictory statements the Leave campaign has made on the economy, claiming it has had 23 positions on the alternative to the single market.  Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott described the claims as desperate stuff from an increasingly desperate campaign.  We have set out a series of pledges about how life will be better if we take back control. We want to invest more in the NHS, create 300,000 jobs through new trade deals, cut energy bills for families and introduce a new Australian style points-based immigration system, he said.  Meanwhile, in a letter to the Guardian, union leaders - including the general secretaries of Unite, Unison and the GMB - backed the campaign to remain in the EU.  They warned the Conservative government would negotiate away our rights if voters backed Brexit.  Workers' rights - including maternity and paternity rights, equal treatment for workers and the right to paid leave - had been negotiated with European partners, they said.  If Britain leaves the EU we are in no doubt these protections would be under great threat, the union added.  	Boris Johnson warns of EU migration 'risks'	false
f0737897	Our NHS is safer in Europe: #NHSsaferIN  14 Jun 2016, by Frances O'Grady in Public services  Today I’m proud to be joining NHS staff and supporters at a rally at Congress House. We’re coming together to say don’t risk a leave vote – Don’t risk our NHS. And there’s a lot to concern us, whether we work in the NHS or rely on it for our families’ health care.  To start with, there’s the potential loss of so many talented NHS staff from the EU. That could unleash a staffing crisis in the NHS.  Where on earth would our NHS be without all the staff who are so dedicated to it: The doctors, nurses and support staff? The NHS staffing roster includes 50,000 staff from the European Economic Area – including 9,000 doctors, 18,000 nurses and midwives, and over 2,000 other health professionals.  These are people who fill crucial skills gaps, and use their incredible knowledge and expertise to help save British lives.  Of course the government should be investing more in training opportunities for locals. Our government’s NHS bursary cuts have been the worst thing possible in dealing with a growing training crisis.  But migrants don’t clog the NHS up – they prop it up.  Yes, our NHS is at breaking point. Staff are over-worked and services are stretched. But that’s not because of decent, hard-working migrants who pay their way. Migrants are often younger people, less likely to need health services than the average UK citizen but still paying UK taxes to support them.  The NHS is in a staffing crisis because the government has imposed another five-year spending freeze. The Tories’ pay cap has created recruitment and retention problems throughout the service, which means more and more taxpayers money is wasted on agencies and management consultants, increasing our deep reliance on EU healthcare staff.  Across the NHS, staff are demoralized – fed up with too little funding to help the patients they care so deeply about, too many top down reorganisations and not enough ministerial respect. And fed up that their dedication is being taken for granted.  The EU’s Working Time Directive means we have rules that protect staff wellbeing, and don’t needlessly risk patient safety. We already have dedicated health staff putting in long hours, but many Brexit leaders want to overturn their rights to refuse excessive working hours and push them to work even longer.  And of course funding for the NHS depends on Britain’s economy doing well. Pretty much everyone agrees leaving the EU will hit the economy even brexiteers admit it would hurt in the short term, and that will put our crisis hit NHS even deeper in trouble.  Based on IFS analysis, if we leave the EU, the public purse is likely to lose enough money each year to fund the whole of NHS England for 3 months.  Of course not all the public spending cuts would fall on the NHS. But it could still be as much as £10 billion a year by the end of the decade. Equivalent to every hospital trust in England cutting 1,000 nurses and 155 doctors.  But the thing that gets me about the discussion of the NHS in this referendum campaign is the hypocrisy. Because when did the leading lights of Brexit ever give a toss about the NHS?  Does anyone really believe that Boris Johnson cares about the NHS? That’s the same Boris Johnson who is on record saying he doesn’t believe in a free NHS; and that if people paid for services, they’d value them more.  Or Michael Gove who co-authored a book saying the NHS is “no longer relevant in the 21st century”? Or Iain Duncan Smith, who has said he’d prefer a social insurance system? Or even Nigel Farage, who believes that within the next ten years the NHS should be replaced by private health insurance?  I don’t believe they support the NHS as we know and love it, any more than I believe they oppose the EU/US TTIP trade deal. If we came out of the EU, these men would sign us up to their own secret trade deals like a shot. We wouldn’t even know about the deals; let alone have the chance to change them.  But perhaps the Leave campaign’s most shameful fib of all is the claim that leaving the EU would mean more money for the NHS. Frankly, I was gobsmacked when I first saw the Leave campaign’s battle bus slogan.  As the Tory MP and former GP Sarah Wollaston said last week, when she defected from leave to remain: “it simply isn’t true”. Even if we trusted them to do the right thing with the cash, the sums simply don’t add up. They’ve been repeatedly slammed for it by the UK’s statistics watchdog.  The leave campaign are fond of saying we remainers are negative. To be honest when faced with a change that could cause such damage it’s hard not to be. But there are also positive reasons to vote Remain for our NHS.  Being in the EU helps make our NHS better. It means a common set of professional standards across the EU. And when you’re away for work or on holiday, British citizens get the right to free healthcare in other member states.  It also means significant funding for research and development into health. Just last year, the UK received £232 million of EU money – incidentally the largest slice of funding received by any EU member state. That included vital money for research at Great Ormond Street children’s hospital, University Hospital Birmingham and NHS Blood and Transplant services. It keeps the NHS at the forefront of healthcare worldwide.  So we have a choice to make. To build our NHS – or risk it. To back our NHS – or privatise it. And to celebrate and cherish NHS staff – or demonise and divide them. A vote to Leave isn’t just a big gamble with jobs, wages and rights, it’s also a big gamble with our NHS.  The NHS was built by and for working people. It is about solidarity, collaboration and co-operation. And it is too special, too precious, to entrust to the privatising Tories and UKIP, who are pushing Brexit as a way towards a deregulated, low-tax and low-services UK.  The NHS needs to be safeguarded if it’s going to be able to care for our children and grandchildren. I’ll be voting remain to do that.	Our NHS is safer in Europe: #NHSsaferIN	other
2cf85ad9	Theresa May put affordable housing at the heart of her offer to voters when she became prime minister.  The government's target is one million new homes by 2020; the argument being that more supply will bring down prices.  But the head of one of the UK's largest housebuilders, Berkeley Homes, says the target may be missed.  Radical change will be required to raise the current new-build rate above 170,000 per year, says Rob Perrins.  When I asked him if the target would be hit, his answer was emphatic.  The answer is no, and surprisingly the answer is not due to planning, he said.  There have been some very good reforms in planning over the past few years. [However] there are three reasons why they will not hit the target.  Firstly, there is not enough land ready for development.  Secondly, the UK has the highest property taxation in the world. And it acts as a disincentive to build and [for people to] move.  And thirdly, I don't believe it is a top three political issue. And there is nothing more important for those under 30 than resolving the housing crisis, Mr Perrins added.  He said the government should take the issue as seriously as funding the National Health Service.  I interviewed Mr Perrins on the Kidbrooke estate in south-east London, where Berkeley Homes is building 4,500 new homes - 1,500 of which will be cheaper affordable homes.  The Kidbrooke estate is Britain's housing crisis in microcosm.  In the 1960s, the area was called the Ferrier Estate, a depressing jungle of pre-cast concrete that had fallen into disrepair.  In the 1990s, the local council, Greenwich - which Mr Perrins describes as one of the best when it comes to backing housing development - starting planning to redevelop the site.  It took 10 years to achieve a development agreement for the area, signed in 2007. House buildingimage copyrightPA  There are 800 conditions attached to the planning permission, from the type of building materials used, to the type of energy supply needed, to the type of facilities - such as a new school and health centre - that will be provided.  All might be very necessary, but all slow down the system.  The final houses will not be completed until 2030 - more than 30 years after the council first earmarked the area for redevelopment. Slow progress  Building homes in the UK is a glacial business.  The real issue in my view is getting land ready for development, Mr Perrins said.  It is also about infrastructure. It's about electricity. It's about gas. It's about adjoining land permissions. It's about all the infrastructure issues around getting land ready, and there are an awful lot of those.  There are, of course, many other reasons put forward for the chronic shortage of new homes in the UK.  One is that housebuilders deliberately constrain supply to keep prices - and their profits - high.  The government is considering bringing in financial sanctions for housebuilders that do not develop land quickly enough.  That policy proposal could be fleshed out in a housing White Paper to be published before Christmas.  Mr Perrins dismissed this criticism of housebuilders, saying that companies like his were ready to build.  We take huge risks getting sites like this [Kidbrooke] ready for development, he said.  It's hugely complicated and we take those risks over a number of years.  It also requires an awful lot of capital. Sites like this require over £200m of capital to bring them forward, he pointed out. 'Raise our game'  Returns need to be good to keep shareholders - which include many people's pension funds - satisfied.  You mustn't bring in policies that are a disincentive to bringing house [building] forward, Mr Perrins said about any government action on fining companies that do not build new homes quickly enough.  The government owns 40% of the land in the UK; they have enough of their own land to solve the housing crisis, he added. Bricksimage copyrightPA  With Number 10 and the Treasury both saying that new housebuilding is a priority, the government department responsible for delivering on housing policy - communities and local government - is under scrutiny.  The housing minister, Gavin Barwell, told me he didn't agree the one million new homes target by 2020 would definitely be missed.  I certainly accept that at the current rate we are not going to hit it, so we need to raise our game, he said.  But I think if you look in both our own past and if you look to some of our near neighbours, it is possible to build the number of homes we need in this country and it is my job, working with my boss Sajid Javid [the Communities and Local Government Secretary] to make sure we do it, the minister added.  How? is the question governments have been asked for decades, ever since the 1960s and 1970s when house building was a public and private affair, with 100,000 council houses a year adding to the number built by private developers.  I think if there was a simple answer to that question, someone would have solved the problem already, Mr Barwell said.  I think there is a combination of things. In some parts of the country we are not releasing enough land into the system.  Then often people get planning permission, but it takes too long to turn that into a home - you can't live in a planning permission.  We're too slow to get spades in the ground when we've got planning permission.  I think we are too dependent on a small number of large housebuilders, so we need to broaden the range of the people who are doing the building.  And then we need to make sure we've got enough people in the country who have got the skills to work in the industry, he said.  Mrs May has been careful to avoid too many targets in her short time as prime minister.  But she knows the one million new homes by 2020 will be one for which voters can and will hold her accountable.  Expect a flurry of government activity - on simplifying planning rules and promoting local authority building - by the end of the year. 	PM 'will not hit' one million new homes target	false
d56e6e70	The number of hospital beds for people with acute mental health conditions, where a consultant psychiatrist is on hand to oversee treatment, has fallen by almost 30% since 2009 despite repeated claims by ministers that improving care for the mentally ill is now a top priority.  New official figures show that the number of beds for those with some of the most serious conditions – including psychosis, serious depression leading to suicidal feelings and eating disorders – has fallen from 26,448 in 2009 to 18,082 in the first quarter of this year.  Over the same nine years, the data also show significant falls in the number of mental health nurses working in the NHS – from 46,155 to 39,358 – and in the number of doctors in specialist psychiatry training, from 3,187 in 2009 to 2,588 in the first quarter of this year.  Last night, the MP Dr Dan Poulter, a former Tory health minister who is now practising part-time as an NHS doctor in mental health services, said it was clear that government rhetoric about giving mental health “parity of esteem” with physical health was not matched by action.  Poulter, who obtained the new data through parliamentary answers, said that mental health was still a “Cinderella service”, with child and adolescent mental health lagging the furthest behind acceptable standards. The service in which he works is not just inadequate but also unsafe for patients, he claimed. “The reality on the ground is that there are ever fewer beds available for the patients who need them. This means that people who are very unwell, for example with psychosis or depression with suicidal ideation, are unable to access timely inpatient care. Eating disorders is another service where there is often a long wait for patients who need beds for urgent inpatient care. This is not safe for the patients.  “Mental health professionals work incredibly hard but we are under-resourced. Despite the need to expand services to meet the needs of patients, and to provide more support for people with mental illness in the community, there are simply not the resources available to do it.”  The shortage of beds leaves the most vulnerable shunted around the country or even in prison waiting for care they need. Janet Davies  Bed shortages are so severe in some parts of England that patients are sometimes sent hundreds of miles from home, and even to Scotland, to access inpatient care. Ministers have pledged to eradicate out-of-area care by 2020, but up to 700 people a month are still being cared for away from their home area.  Health organisations and charities said the data was further evidence that ministers were failing to respond adequately to a growing mental health crisis. Janet Davies, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said that the figures showed that politicians’ promises to improve NHS provision for those experiencing mental illness had not been honoured.  “Despite all the rhetoric on the importance of mental health, these figures show the painful reality. Thousands of experienced professionals have been lost and this shortage of inpatient beds leaves the most vulnerable shunted around the country or even in prison cells waiting for the care they desperately need,” Davies said.  Paul Farmer, chief executive of the mental health charity Mind and chairman of NHS England’s taskforce on mental health in 2015-16, said: “Mental health services have often been seen as a soft target for cuts, and these figures are a stark reminder of the longterm consequences of under-investing in the mental health workforce.”  The 2012 Health and Social Care Act established that there should be “parity of esteem” between physical and mental health. But despite promises of extra funding, many mental health trusts have been forced to cut acute mental health beds. Many NHS staff complain that services in the community are so inadequately funded that they fail to prevent patients with serious problems from ending up in hospital.  In October 2017, the prime minister Theresa May stressed that improving the treatment of mental health was one of her top priorities. “Tackling the injustice of mental illness is one of my absolute priorities as prime minister and I believe that by taking these steps together we as a society can transform how we think about mental illness, and improve the way we care for all those with mental health problems,” she said. But since then, the number of acute mental health beds has continued to fall and is now at its lowest for more than a decade. Last week, in the House of Commons, she admitted that more needed to be done, and that the service had been “overlooked for too long”.  NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens last week identified mental health as one of the five priorities that the service’s ten-year plan will need to tackle. Due in November, this will set out how the NHS will spend the extra £20bn it has been given. He warned, however, that improving mental health provision could take more than five years to achieve – because of understaffing.  However, in his first speech as the new health and social care secretary on Friday, Matt Hancock did not cite mental health as one of his three main priorities, despite Theresa May’s strong personal interest in the issue and description of it as one of British society’s “burning injustices”.  A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “Mental health is one of this government’s top priorities and we are committed to seeing services improve through record amounts of funding, an additional £1bn between 2017-18 and 2020-2021, and major increases to the workforce, with 21,000 new posts to be created by 2021.” Government sources said that there was a recognition that more nurses were needed, which was why ministers had announced an increase of more than 5,000 extra nurse-training places, which would be available from September, including mental health training places.

24fd8f3f	Howl, beat your head against the wall, tear your hair and despair of this country. How can it be that nearly half the population thinks the reason people lost their jobs in the pandemic was due to their own underperformance? Just 31% attribute it to bad luck. Look around every city and town to see the shuttered shops, closed offices, boarded-up pubs, bars and restaurants, the blindingly obvious signs of the mass loss of jobs. Yet again those on the left are forced to confront some dismal realities about British public attitudes.  King’s College London’s deep research into how people feel about inequality is enough to all but extinguish political hope. It’s nice to know that Labour supporters are kinder than their Tory counterparts, but even so, a shocking 39% of Labour voters think it’s people’s own fault they lost their jobs, as this week the unemployment rate hit 5%, with worse to come.  Why does it keep shocking us, since the British people have most commonly voted in Conservative governments, with Labour crushed again and again? The Brexit vote came as the heaviest hammer-blow in living memory, followed by Boris Johnson’s triumph. This research shows that enthusing the public with a strong enough will to significantly reduce inequality requires exceptionally clever efforts of persuasion.  “There is no widespread appetite for change,” concludes the final section of this devastating report. What a blow to all of us who hope this crisis can be a 1945 moment, that the state’s massive intervention for the survival of so many might have whetted the appetite for more. “We should not expect a widespread reappraisal of the case for greater government intervention in the economy, despite the economic hardship wrought by the pandemic,” is the sobering conclusion.  Its lead author, Professor Bobby Duffy, long-time Ipsos Mori researcher on social attitudes, reminded me that there has been historic change for the better in attitudes on race, gender and sexuality, and that younger people are considerably more progressive than those who are old. But when I talked to him, he warned that attitudes can change again: “It doesn’t mean there won’t be backsliding.”  He warned on race that a fixed 13% have toxic racist attitudes. A quarter of people think Covid causing a rise in ethnic inequality wouldn’t be problem, though 67% say it would. Gender inequality ranks low as a concern, possibly because an older generation remember how much that has already improved.  Here’s the great political gulf, which interestingly falls along Brexit-related lines: two-thirds of Labour remainers believe the crisis justifies more state intervention, compared to only one in five Conservative leavers. The pandemic has barely shifted views, despite all that clapping for carers and key workers. While 82% of Labour remainers believed Britain was unequal before the coronavirus outbreak, that view is shared by just 53% of Conservative leavers. What should be done about it now? That depends on how the question is phrased: use the word “redistribution” and support for action is just 48%, but phrase it as “government should take measures to reduce differences in income levels” and support rises to 62%. Tax those who are very rich and companies, but not themselves, is roughly how that translates, as in much other polling.  The one question of disadvantage on which most agree is inequality of place. Some 61% agree that inequalities between more and less deprived areas are the most serious kind. Paul Johnson, head of the IFS, for whom this research forms part of its Deaton Review of Inequalities, finds this startling. He puzzles over whether people mean north and south, say Burnley versus Twickenham, or do they, he hopes, mean the divide between poor and rich districts everywhere? London, for example, may have grotesque wealth among City bankers, but it has the most poverty too, and he says, is by far the hardest hit by unemployment caused by the pandemic. Averages deceive wickedly.  “Take the real divide between graduates and non-graduates,” Johnson says. “After counting housing costs, a graduate in Burnley has the same income as one in Twickenham, but lots more graduates living in Twickenham give it a high average.” Can that simple fact be explained, so people realise that levelling up is not just big projects in the north, but levelling up low incomes everywhere?  These findings will warm the cockles of Conservative hearts, but present painful dilemmas for Labour. Tackling inequality is Labour’s great cause, but that may be a rebarbative word with too many voters. Paul Johnson recalls, “Tony Blair never mentioned inequality, yet with tax credits, did more than any government to ease poverty.” Blair spoke instead of “social exclusion”. Those who criticise Keir Starmer for his caution should study this report in depth.  Most depressing is how many people attribute success and failure only to hard work and ambition: people believe this is a meritocracy, not a system governed by birth and luck. Prof Duffy talked of how since the 1970s individual blame has replaced systemic injustice as people’s explanation for inequality. Britain was at its most equal in 1975, but with the blast of Thatcherism that took the lid off top earnings and saw bottom earnings fall back, came a dose of Americanised individualism. More than half the workforce belonged to a union in the 1970s, and they were vectors not just of power, but political education. Now only 23% are members and unions’ political influence is weak in public discourse. The collective is replaced with a warped idea of merit, disseminated by the right, deliberately ignoring the social injustices that predestine futures from birth.  Because we have to live in hope, and yet also cleave to realism, this research suggests the best way to engage voters with inequality is through locality and place. But whisper the word.

b88444d1	Planned government spending cuts will see at least 22,000 police jobs being lost, leaving the public protected by the lowest numbers of officers since the 1970s, according to a private estimate circulating among police chiefs.  The figure, obtained by the Guardian, is much higher than previously known, and means the number of police officers in England and Wales could fall to nearly 100,000.  The estimate being provided to chief constables is based on the lowest expected cut of 25% in the funding that government provides for policing between now and 2020. At present there are about 125,000 officers working in England and Wales.  After the budget in July from the newly elected Conservative government, the chancellor, George Osborne, told unprotected departments, such as the Home Office that funds the police, that their cuts would range from 25%-40%.  Senior Home Office officials and police have met in a “gold group” to formulate arguments to the Treasury ahead of its decision about how much more each department should save. The money each government department receives is announced in the comprehensive spending review which is due to be announced in November.  One senior officer told the Guardian: “This time a greater part of the reduction will be borne by police officers.” One police chief added that the cuts will mean fewer officers and a pruning back of neighbourhood policing and proactive prevention work which stops crime levels rising.  Privately, police chiefs believe the public do not appreciate the scale of cuts and what they will mean. They are resigned to further cuts given the wider cuts to public spending and are working on the basis that their funding will have been slashed by at least 40% or more from 2010 to 2020.  An estimated 17,000 officer posts were eliminated in the last round of cuts under the Conservative-led coalition government between 2010-15.  The estimate is not the only one circulating among senior officers. An alternative projection suggests the level of officer losses could be higher at 30,000 in the next five years across the 43 police forces in England and Wales.  Last month there was controversy after Sara Thornton, the chair of the body representing police chiefs, said a police officer may not attend every burglary. Police sources privately argue that the public does not accept rationing in policing.  Police chiefs say policing will change, even more so if higher cuts in the next five years approaching 40% are imposed, because there are no longer any easy efficiency savings to make.  The cuts faced from 2010-15 were met by efficiency savings, selling buildings, and losing civilian staff. Privately, police chiefs accept that in 2010 they were able to do without 12% of the budget and they had got used to times of relative financial plenty under Labour. However, they argue that the era of cuts without impact on the service have long gone.  In 2010 when the cuts started there were 143,734 full-time police officers, as well as 16,900 police community support officers PCSOs, and 83,000 civilian staff. Now there are 125,000 police officers, and in total 35,000 staff and officers lost from 2010-15.  The small Sussex force, which dealt with the Shoreham air crash, is planning to lose at least a further 500 officers. Matt Webb, chair of the Sussex police federation, which represents rank and file officers, said: “We stripped back other costs last time. To keep making these savings at some point you have to reduce staff costs.”  He said Sussex police was considering reducing or ending its response to low-level incidents such as shoplifting where little is alleged to be stolen, and non-residential burglaries targeting businesses or storage units. West Midlands police, the second biggest force, estimates it will have nearly halved in size in a decade, down from 14,000 total staff in 2010 to 8,000 in 2020, again assuming the lower level of cuts.  Greater Manchester police is expecting a similar reduction in personnel.  Mike Penning, minister for policing, crime, criminal justice and victims said: “Police reform is working. Over the last five years, frontline services have been protected, public confidence in the police has gone up and crime has fallen by more than a quarter, according to the independent crime survey for England and Wales.  “There is no question that the police still have the resources to do their important work. What matters is how officers are deployed, not how many of them there are in total.  “The changes the government have made since 2010 have made it easier for the police to do their job by cutting red tape, scrapping unnecessary targets, and giving forces the discretion to use their professional judgement. Decisions on the operational deployment of resources, such as PCSOs, are matters for chief constables, in association with police and crime commissioners.”    The Conservatives say they have cut the money that policing cost the taxpayer and have also cut crime. The government’s position was set out in a speech that the home secretary, Theresa May, gave to the Police Federation just after the Conservatives won the general election in May.  “We have reformed your pay and pensions, reduced police spending, and yes, there are fewer officers overall,” May said. “But – despite the predictions of the federation, and despite the predictions of the politicians who wanted to sell you a false dream of ever more spending – crime is down by more than a quarter since 2010, according to the independent crime survey for England and Wales.”	Police force could lose 22,000 jobs under new spending cuts	partially false
2562c7c0	In early June, no one knew what Article 50 was. Now, everyone knows: It is the piece of EU law in the Lisbon Treaty that will trigger Britain's exit from the European Union.  We do not know when prime minister Theresa May will formally trigger Article 50. It could come as soon as this year, or 10 years from now. Almost everyone assumes that once the UK's Article 50 request is made, that's it. We're out. No going back.  But ... there is a little-known loophole in Article 50 that would keep the UK in the EU even after the request is triggered. Basically, the UK can change its mind after the Article 50 request is made as long as no final agreement on Brexit has been reached.  First, this is the text of Article 50:  A Member State which decides to withdraw shall notify the European Council of its intention. In the light of the guidelines provided by the European Council, the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union. That agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with Article 2183 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It shall be concluded on behalf of the Union by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.  Any country making an Article 50 request has two years to reach a pact with the EU. After that, you're out. So as a matter of logistics, the UK is not likely to trigger Article 50 until after it has secured an exit deal to the government's liking. That could take a long time.  But even if that happens, Article 50 still lets us back in.  Most people mistakenly think that the only way back into the EU is through an Article 49 request. Any country wishing to join the EU must go through Article 49 -- it is the standard process for all new countries, and it takes years. The UK would be at the back of that line. Article 50 even mentions this process, which is why so many people think it is the only way back. It says: If a State which has withdrawn from the Union asks to rejoin, its request shall be subject to the procedure referred to in Article 49.  But the House of Lords did the UK a favour and asked for legal advice on the specific question of whether Britain can change its mind. The advice came from Sir David Edward KCMG, QC, PC, FRSE, a former Judge of the Court of Justice of the European Union and Professor Emeritus at the School of Law, University of Edinburgh; and Professor Derrick Wyatt QC, Emeritus Professor of Law, Oxford University, and also of Brick Court Chambers.

Read our privacy notice  Here is what their advice said:  Can a Member State's decision to withdraw be reversed?  We asked our witnesses whether it was possible to reverse a decision to withdraw. Both agreed that a Member State could legally reverse a decision to withdraw from the EU at any point before the date on which the withdrawal agreement took effect. Once the withdrawal agreement had taken effect, however, withdrawal was final. Sir David told us: It is absolutely clear that you cannot be forced to go through with it if you do not want to: for example, if there is a change of Government. Professor Wyatt supported this view with the following legal analysis:  There is nothing in the wording to say that you cannot. It is in accord with the general aims of the Treaties that people stay in rather than rush out of the exit door. There is also the specific provision in Article 50 to the effect that, if a State withdraws, it has to apply to rejoin de novo. That only applies once you have left. If you could not change your mind after a year of thinking about it, but before you had withdrawn, you would then have to wait another year, withdraw and then apply to join again. That just does not make sense. Analysis of the text suggests that you are entitled to change your mind.  ... There is nothing in Article 50 formally to prevent a Member State from reversing its decision to withdraw in the course of the withdrawal negotiations. The political consequences of such a change of mind would, though, be substantial.  So, to sum up, even if the UK triggers Article 50 we can still cancel that decision if, for instance, there was a change of government. But the government would be up against the clock: It would have to make that U-turn before the rest of the EU voted on the Article 50 request, and before the two-year deadline elapsed.  Given how long the exit process is likely to take, and how unpredictable UK politics has suddenly become, don't rule out a change of government or a change of heart.

ffba0bf9	Net migration to the UK has dropped to 273,000 in the year to September, down 49,000 from the previous year.  The Office for National Statistics said it was the first time in two years the balance of people arriving and leaving the UK had dipped below 300,000.  But it is short of the government's aim of an annual figure below 100,000.  Immigration was estimated to be 596,000 - comprising 268,000 EU citizens, 257,000 non-EU citizens and 71,000 British citizens.  This included the highest level ever recorded of Romanians and Bulgarians - 74,000.  Some 323,000 people are thought to have left the UK in the year to September, up by 26,000 on the 12 months to September 2015.  Of these, 128,000 were British citizens, along with 103,000 EU citizens and 93,000 non-EU citizens. line Analysis By Dominic Casciani, home affairs correspondent  Net migration is down. But while the net decrease looks substantial, nobody can say for sure what's triggered the change because these quarterly figures could have been influenced by a string of short-term factors.  For a start, there appears to have been a rise in emigration - and when that goes up, net migration can come down.  Secondly, some of the change could be down to seasonal fluctuations in student numbers.  Thirdly, although there were significant departures by people from some parts of Eastern Europe, the number coming from poorer Romania and Bulgaria went up.  The upshot is the overall number of people arriving for a job is broadly the same. What does it all amount to? Immigration statistics are an inexact science - and at the moment it's very difficult to know for sure what's going on. line  The figures are the first to include migration estimates following the EU referendum in June.  Nicola White, head of international migration statistics at the ONS, said it was too early to say what effect the referendum has had on long-term migration.  Home Secretary Amber Rudd accepted the government was still far from reaching its net migration target, but said the figures demonstrated we can reduce immigration where we can control it.  She denied a rise in people going back to countries such as Poland reflected an uncertainty among EU citizens living in the UK over their futures.  Ms Rudd said: At the moment we have open immigration with the EU members, freedom of movement, so they can come and go as they want.  I don't see any particularly significant change within EU migration. The real change will be when we leave the EU, and then we will be able to make the choices ourselves what level of immigration we want to have.  And she said that Britain remained open to EU citizens already living here and contributing to the economy, saying: Let's not be in any doubt that the UK will always be a welcoming place for people who want to come here, work here and contribute to our economy.  Sunder Katwala, director of the think-tank British Future, said the figures showed the immigration debate will have to move on in the light of Brexit.  He said: A one-size-fits-all approach to immigration can't help us make the post-Brexit choices that the government and the public now face. Graph of Office for National Statistics data on migration Citizenship levels  Meanwhile, separate figures from the Home Office show that a near-record number of EU nationals were granted British citizenship last year.  Citizenship was given to 16,754 people from EU countries, the second highest since records were first compiled, behind the 17,645 in 2013.  Some 6,498 members of the EU 14 countries - older member states such as France, Spain and Germany - were granted UK citizenship in 2016, up 50% on the previous 12 months and the highest ever for a single year.  A further 6,813 people from the EU 8 countries, which include Poland, gained British citizenship, a rise of 18%, surpassed only by figures for 2013.  Citizenship was given to 3,215 Romanians and Bulgarians, up 20% on 2015 and again only topped by 2013 figures.  Other points within the ONS statistics were:      A fall of 10,000 in people coming to the UK from eight Eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2004, to 58,000     Emigration from the UK of people from these countries was up by 12,000 from September 2015 to 39,000, the highest level in five years     The number of non-EU citizens from Africa, the Americas and Oceania leaving the UK increased by 11,000, to 39,000     The 134,000 people coming to the UK to study was a marked decreased, down by 41,000 from September 2015. The majority of these were non-EU citizens - 87,000, down by 31,000     About 294,000 people came to the UK to work in the year to September 2016, including 180,000 EU citizens. Of these, 190,000 had a definite job to go to, the highest estimate recorded, compared with 169,000 the previous year     About 104,000 people came to the UK looking for work, down from the 120,000 the previous year     There were 38,517 applications for asylum in 2016, down by 1,451 in 2015.

f2a01c39	Rises in National Insurance Contributions NICS for self-employed workers have been criticised as penalising entrepreneurs.  Chancellor Philip Hammond announced in the Budget that the rate for Class 4 NICS would rise from 9% to 10% in April 2018, and to 11% in 2019.  That compares to 12% currently paid by employees.  The difference in National Insurance Contributions is no longer justified, Mr Hammond said.  Self-employed people have traditionally paid lower NICS than employees, as they receive fewer state benefits.  But the chancellor said the self-employed now had equal access to the new state pension. He also said that the government would consult on parental benefits, some of which self-employed people cannot claim.  The chancellor said all self-employed people who earned less than £16,250 would be better off.  Around half of the 4.8 million workers registered as self-employed earn less than £13,000, according to the think tank the Resolution Foundation.  As a result it said most such workers - such as low-paid hairdressers - will be better off by 2019/20. line Winners and Losers hairdresserimage copyrightGetty Images      A self-employed hairdresser - with average earnings of £12,700 - will be £70 better off       A self-employed taxi driver - with average earnings of £17,300 - will be £20 worse off      A self-employed management consultant - with average earnings of £51,100 - will be £620 worse off.  source: Resolution Foundation line  But the rise, which will cost those affected an average of 60p a week, was criticised by entrepreneurs.  Increasing National Insurance rates for the self-employed could be a further step by the government to penalise those who are taking risks and starting a business, said Lucy-Rose Walker, the chief executive of Entrepreneurial Spark.  Others said it was unfair that the self-employed would have to pay more, when they do not receive the same level of state benefits.  Self-employees are subject to a lower national insurance contribution because they do not receive the same entitlements and benefits as their employed counterparts - such as holiday and sick leave, said Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of tax at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.

Under Class 2 NICS, self-employed workers pay 2% on qualifying earnings between £5,965 and £8060, amounting to £2.80 a week.  The increase in the NICS rate will raise £145m a year for the Treasury by 2021-22.  Matthew Taylor, head of the Royal Society of Arts, is due to produce a report on how the self-employed are taxed later this year.  He has already said that the Treasury is missing out on millions of pounds, as a result of the workers who have been designated as self-employed.

e5a08193	Image copyright Getty Images  Workers on zero-hour contracts, agency employees or gig economy workers are to be better protected by a package of workplace reforms, the government says.  Under new legislation to be introduced on Monday, staff would have to be told details of their rights from their first day in a job, including eligibility for paid and sick leave.  Workers would also be given the right to request more predictable hours.  But Labour and the unions say the planned reforms do not go far enough.  The reforms are based on the findings of a review into modern working practices led by Matthew Taylor, a former aide to ex-PM Tony Blair and chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts.  Ministers say the new legislation will:  close a loophole that had allowed agency staff to be paid less than permanent employees  ensure firms will have to provide a statement of rights on the first day of a person's employment, setting out what paid leave they are entitled to, including for illness, maternity and paternity leave  increase the maximum fine employers face at a tribunal from £5,000 to £20,000, if they are found to have demonstrated malice, spite or gross oversight  ensure that companies will have to calculate holiday pay based on 52 weeks, as opposed to 12 weeks, so people in seasonal or atypical roles get the paid time off they are entitled to  Business Secretary Greg Clark said: Today's largest upgrade in workers' rights in over a generation is a key part of building a labour market that continues to reward people for hard work, that celebrates good employers and is boosting productivity and earning potential across the UK.  However, Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: The right to request guaranteed working hours is no right all.  Zero-hours contract workers will have no more leverage than Oliver Twist.   Unless unions get the right to organise and bargain for workers in places like Uber and Amazon, too many working people will continue to be treated like disposable labour, she added.  Image copyright Getty Images  Matthew Fell, chief UK policy director at the CBI, said: [Businesses] welcome a new law giving all workers the right to request more predictable working hours, which will help to facilitate the conversations that are essential to ensuring flexibility benefits both parties.  But he said: Legislation to amend employment status rules risks making the law less able to adapt to new forms of work in the future.  The government agrees with the Taylor review that completely banning zero-hour contracts would negatively impact more people than it helped.  It also said that platform-based working - including the likes of ride-sharing app Uber or food delivery business Deliveroo - offers genuine two-way flexibility for firms and workers.  Zero-hour contracts, where an employer does not have to offer work and an employee has no obligation to work when asked, are highly controversial.  The Archbishop of Canterbury called the contracts the reincarnation of an ancient evil.	Workplace reforms 'will protect gig economy workers'	false
8761c91b	Nick Ansell/PA Wire File photo dated 15/12/14 of Leader of the Green Party of England and Wales Natalie Bennett, who has denied claims that she said being poor in India was not as bad as being on benefits in Britain.  Green Party leader Natalie Bennett has said she is deeply disappointed after media regulator Ofcom said it believed the Green party was not important enough to be included in the televised general election debates.  In a consultation released on Thursday, Ofcom said it did not think the Greens qualified as a major party that should be included, however it said Ukip may qualify for major party status in England and Wales”, despite its failure to demonstrate demonstrated significant past electoral support in General Elections”.  The decision is a blow to Bennett's party, as those classed as major parties are allowed at least two party election broadcasts in the run-up to the general election. However, Ofcom could still change its view, as its initial assessment marks the start of a consultation that runs until 5 February.  Bennett reacted with fury to Ofcom's initial judgement in a blog for The Huffington Post UK, writing: Obviously, as leader of the Green Party, I'm deeply disappointed by this decision, but as a voter and citizen I'm also gravely concerned about the possible impact on British democracy if this stance is maintained in the final guidance.  Ofcom is not only ignoring the views of the 275,000 people who signed the petition calling for the Greens to be included in the broadcasters' proposed leaders' debates, but also the evidence that 79% of the public want to see us in those debates and 85% of women.  She went on: I do think we have people in positions of power who have very fixed ideas about what politics looks and sounds like, think that it's a basically an unchanging wrestle between the traditional big two, with a couple of satellites that squeeze into the gaps without really saying anything different.  When you put together the support for the Green Parties of England and Wales, and Scotland, and Northern Ireland, with those for the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru, there's very strong backing for an anti-austerity alternative to the Coalition-Labour approach, as Nicola Sturgeon, Leanne Wood and I pointed out last month.  This comes after Labour frontbencher Sadiq Khan backed calls for the Greens to be included in the election debates, telling the New Statesman: What the British public deserve to see is all the leaders, and that includes Natalie Bennett, by the way, having a debate about their vision for the country, their analysis of the last five years, an explanation from Cameron and Clegg how the deficit is still £200bn more than they predicted.  Ofcom's decision has raised eyebrows as the Greens have already started to post better poll ratings than the Lib Dems.  Research for Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft put the party on a new high of 8% - up three points - and just ahead of the Lib Dems on 7%.

62b8396b	Pupils in most secondary schools are being taught by staff not trained in the subject they are teaching, according to a new report.  A survey of 885 schools by the Association of School and College Leaders, which represents secondary school heads, reveals 73 per cent were having to put teachers not trained in the subject they were teaching in front of classes. In addition, 84 per cent said that teacher shortages were having a detrimental effect on the education they were providing.  The subject areas worst hit by what has been described by ASCL president Allan Foulds as a “national crisis” are maths where 78 per of schools are having to make do with staff not trained in the subject, science 75 per cent and English 57 per cent.  Other problem areas are languages with 33 per cent of schools using non-specialist teachers, geography 25 per cent and history 14 per cent. In all, 89 per cent said they were experiencing difficulties in recruiting teachers.  Last month, the National Audit Office revealed that the Department for Education has failed to meet its recruitment targets for trainee teachers for the past four years. The Chief Inspector of Schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, also warned last week of a “brain drain” as teachers opt for jobs in satellite schools abroad, set up by many of the country’s leading independent schools.  The survey coincides with the ASCL’s annual conference this weekend, at which the Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan, is expected to be put under pressure to take action on teacher shortages.  “Teacher shortages leave schools with no option other than to use stop-gap solutions,” said Malcolm Trobe, ASCL general secretary. “Supply staff and non-specialists often do a good job in difficult circumstances, but it is no substitute for having permanent teachers who are experts in their subjects.”  Please enter your email address Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP Thanks for signing up to the News newsletter {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

In addition, the rising cost of pension and national insurance contributions has put pressure on their budgets so they cannot afford to offer higher salaries.  A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: “We are committed to raising the status of teaching and want to work with the ASCL and the profession to make it an attractive career choice.”	Most secondary schools 'use teachers not trained in their subject'	other
d462dc8d	A blitz on helping people with drink, drug and other problems find work is to be launched after it emerged they cost the taxpayer £10 billion a year.  Iain Duncan Smith revealed the figure yesterday as he promised a jobcentre scheme to identify the addictions which are stopping claimants find work.  Under the Universal Support regime, officials will take personal charge of each case to ensure they get treatment, mental health counselling and other support.  Iain Duncan Smith said it costs the taxpayer £10.1billion a year to support people addicted to drugs file photo  Once people have found a job, they will remain under the care of the jobcentre until they are doing sufficient hours to leave the accompanying Universal Credit benefits regime altogether.  The work and pensions secretary said the aim was to find jobs for people who had been ‘parked’ on a life on benefits by the last government.  Mr Duncan Smith added: ‘Too often in the past, people with complex barriers such as addiction, indebtedness or homelessness were written off to a life on benefits.  'Through Universal Support we are putting an end to this, and offering wraparound support for those that need it.  ‘These problems are the root causes of poverty – and if not tackled mean that the cycle of disadvantage will continue into the next generation.’  He pointed to a devastating report by the Lankelly Chase Foundation which found the wider cost to the taxpayer of supporting people with the most severe problems was £10.1 billion a year.  Mr Duncan Smith, pictured, has faced fierce criticism from the Church for his welfare reforms  There are 586,000 people categorised as having at least one serious problem – such as addiction to drink or drugs or homelessness.  Officials said the aim was to reduce the cost of social breakdown by addressing all the ‘barriers’ they face to getting on in life and finding a job.  One said: ‘This is not about cutting benefits – it is about reducing the need.’  Mr Duncan Smith revealed that, for the first time, the Department of Health had acknowledged that having a job improved a person’s health and well-being.  The new policy will allow people who claim mental health problems are preventing them from finding work to access more support.  In about 60 per cent of cases, the problem they have is anxiety or depression.  Help will also be available for people who have problems with housing, childcare, debt and a history of offending.  Mr Duncan Smith has faced fierce criticism from the Church and critics on the Left for his welfare reforms, which they claimed would create ‘unacceptable’ suffering.  But, following a raft of changes to the benefits system designed to incentivise work, the number of children growing up in homes in which nobody has a job has plummeted by 478,000.  The overall number of households where no one was in work fell to the lowest on record in 2015 – almost 700,000 fewer than in 2010.

0adec63d	Local health services today are being allocated £570 billion to fund NHS services and implement the new long term plan.  Every area in England will receive a cash increase of at least 17% over the next five years, including a minimum rise of 4.4% next year.  Some £1 billion a year will be distributed according to the greatest need, with a redeveloped fairer funding formula channelling extra money to places with the highest rates of early death and unmet health needs.  Other changes will mean more investment from April targeted at areas with higher needs for community services for the first time and give greater regard to need for mental health services.  The allocation of funding for local Clinical Commissioning Groups follows publication of the NHS Long Term Plan setting out the priorities of the health service over the next decade.  NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: “This funding backs delivery of the NHS long term plan in every part of England for the next five years.  “It will fund cutting edge treatments such as genome tests for every child with cancer, build up community services to provide more joined up care while taking pressure off hospitals and address the unmet need for mental health services.  “Tackling health inequalities in our society is not just about fairness but is a matter of hard-headed economics which will not only save lives but also save taxpayers’ money and NHS staff time.  “The public can be confident that the NHS will make every penny count, with data published by the Office for National Statistics yesterday showing productivity for health services in England grew by 3% in 2016/17, over three times the growth for the wider UK economy in that year.”  Under the new fairer funding formula two of the areas with the worst rates for premature deaths, Blackpool and Bradford City, will receive increases of 11% and 13% respectively next year alone meaning they have £40 million and £26 million more to invest.  The NHS Long Term Plan, unveiled on Monday, will save an estimated 85,000 more lives each year through earlier detection of killer conditions such as cancer and heart problems and a renewed focus on prevention.  The measures will help prevent 150,000 heart attacks, strokes and dementia cases while more than three million people will benefit from new and improved stroke, respiratory and cardiac services over the next decade.  There is also a new, historic guarantee that investment in primary, community and mental health care will grow faster than the growing overall NHS budget.  This will fund a £4.5 billion new service model for the 21st century across England, where health bodies come together to provide better, joined up care in partnership with local government.  The measures to tackle major physical conditions comes alongside the biggest ever investment in mental health services rising to at least £2.3 billion a year by 2023/24.

98e344da	Human rights laws cost Britain £42bn in rulings and payouts    Membership of the European Court of Human Rights has cost UK taxpayers more than £42billion, according to a report.    The bill for complying with its judgments has seen money thrown at litigation and diverted from essential services, it is claimed.    The court, based in Strasbourg, France, has even forced Parliament to overturn a number of UK laws. It even made the government give prisoners the vote – despite strong opposition from ministers and the public.    Law and Order: The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, where membership is costing Britain billions    The court rules on cases brought against countries that have signed the European Convention on Human Rights, a code drawn up in the light of Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism.    The study into how much the convention and its court cost Britain, which became a signatory in 1950, was carried out by the TaxPayers’ Alliance.    Dr Lee Rotherham, author of the report, said: ‘Fifty years on from the days of Stalin and Hitler, the Strasbourg court is no longer needed to protect us from a knock on the door at 3am, or being deported with a handcart. It carries an increasingly political agenda that is running roughshod over our laws and our courts, at major costs to the taxpayer and to business.    ‘In the homeland of Magna Carta, you would hope that politicians and human rights lawyers might have more self confidence. Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States get by very well without joining up to continental human rights courts. Britain can too.’  Controversial rulings include a transsexual serving time for manslaughter and attempted rape being allowed to move to a woman’s prison even though he committed the offences while a man. The court has also prevented the deportation of foreigners found guilty of serious offences.    The UK lost its first case at the court – which is independent from the EU – in 1975 and had to pay out its first damages in 1980. The report suggested that Britain has lost more than three quarters – 331 out of 418 – of cases heard in Strasbourg.    Labour’s Human Rights Act of 1998 was supposed to reduce the number of appeals to Europe by applying Strasbourg principles in British courts. The rate of lost cases has worsened however.    The cost of complying with judgments under the convention is £17.3billion to date, the report said. In addition, the growth of a compensation culture fostered by the court has added a further £25billion in costs.    Sian Herbert, of the think tank Open Europe, said: ‘The ECHR and the European Court of Justice [which rules on EU law] now act as a de facto supreme court in the UK in many ways.    ‘While we need to remain a country committed to strong protection of basic liberties and rights, these two bodies lack the democratic and judicial legitimacy to fulfil this duty.’	Human rights laws cost Britain £42 bn in rulings and payouts	false

It marks a huge leap forward in this news­paper’s crusade to get Britain out of the EU. Some 14,581 people voted – 11,706 of them want the UK to quit compared with 2,725 who want to remain part of the EU. The mini-referendum – the first on the issue since 1975 – was organised by two senior Tory backbenchers and a prospective Tory MP. They believe the overwhelming result, which will be presented to David Cameron today, will force him to bring forward his planned in-or-out vote on the UK’s future in Europe to next year instead of 2017. The landslide result heaps further pressure on the Prime Minister to act as it comes just days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker compared British membership of the EU to a doomed romance and suggested it was time for Britain to get a divorce. The Tory poll was organised across three neighbouring parliamentary constituencies by Peter Bone, MP for Wellingborough, Philip Hollobone, MP for Kettering, and Tom Pursglove, who is standing as Tory candidate for Corby and East Northamptonshire at this year’s general election.  GETTY The results of the poll confirm that an in-or-out referendum is necessary in 2017, if not earlier  Following the count, carried out in the London offices of the Daily Express yesterday, Mr Bone said: “Eight out of 10 people who took part want to come out of Europe – that is extraordinary. It is very, very, very clear they want to come out.” The turnout, he added, shows there is a “huge interest” in having a nationwide referendum. “People actually bothering to put X on a ballot paper clearly shows that people have been bothered to take part in a referendum and there is a huge interest in it,” he added. “Only the Conservatives will give us the referendum. Ukip can’t and Labour and the Lib Dems won’t.” Mr Hollobone said he expected the result would be reflected nationwide. “My gut feeling is that there would be a majority of people voting to leave across the country,” he said. “Maybe not on the scale we have seen in North Northamptonshire but a majority nevertheless. That is something I wouldn’t have said 10 years ago.”  We will not support a ­Government that does not want a referendum Peter Bone	Message is loud and clear: Britons want to leave EU	false
c142d136	At the time of writing, over one hundred thousand people had succumbed to the latest convulsion of faux outrage by signing a petition demanding that the Royal Family pays for Palace renovation. This refers to the recent decision by the Government to increase the payment allocated to the Royal Family via the Sovereign Grant to cover the £369 million cost of repairing Buckingham Palace, with no major renovation works having been carried out on the vital arteries of the Palace since the Second World War.  The issue with this petition is that it is either completely ignorant of how the Royal Family receives its income and how much is given to the state, or it has deliberately glossed over the facts in favour of pushing some nice easy click bait. So I'll try and present the facts that have been omitted from this petition in an attempt to set the record straight.  First and foremost, Buckingham Palace isn't actually a private residence that is owned by the Queen, or any other Monarch that resides in it. It is the property of the Crown Estate, which is required to give all of its revenue to HM Treasury. The Monarch of the day is allowed to reside in the Palace, but is also obliged to play host to hundreds of state functions every year and has been used by the Government on countless occasions as part of its strategy of soft diplomacy when looking to woo foreign leaders.  Secondly, the petition ignores the fact that the Crown Estate has already paid for the renovation many times over by way of their contributions to Government revenue. In fact, they've already paid for it six times over in the last ten years alone having paid £2.4 billion to the Treasury over that period. That's money that's gone towards paying for the NHS, schools and emergency services. In the last year alone, they handed over £304.1 million to the Exchequer.  Although the Monarch does receive some money back from the Crown Estate profits, this has been set at 15% of the profits of the Crown Estate by way of the Sovereign Grant. In other words, it is the equivalent to you or I handing over 85% of our income in taxes. But even then, the Sovereign Grant is expected to cover the cost of all official business carried out by the Queen, often on behalf of the Government you and I elect.  There should be no doubt that this work on the Palace is essential, but the key thing is that the Crown Estate will have handed over enough profit to the Government in less than two years to fully cover the cost of this necessary but temporary increase in the Sovereign Grant.  Let's get off the back of our Queen and instead take pride in the fact the Crown Estate generates so much revenue for our vital public services every year and that this fantastic British building will be preserved for future generations- and Governments- to reap the benefits of its grandeur.

It would go up to 70 just nine years from now as the change is phased in.  A report by the Centre for Social Justice says Britain can no longer afford the current plan to raise the pension age to 67 in 2028 then 68 by 2046, so it must be speeded up.  The pensions bill has ballooned from £17billion in 1989 to £92billion now, making up £4 of every £10 of welfare spending, the report adds.  By 2023 it will cost £20billion more as the population ages and the birthrate falls.  It proposes raising the eligible age to 70 by 2028 and 75 by 2035.  Image: Reuters  The first people likely to be affected by such a change are those born between March 6, 1961 and April 5, 1977.  Welfare campaigners are appalled by the report and point out that with workplace pensions often unaffordable, three-quarters of Britain’s elderly will rely entirely on their state payments by 2036.  Ex-pensions minister Ros Altmann added: “This might be a great way to save public money but will cause a lot of hardship.  There are huge differences in life expectancy across Britain. There must be a facility for those who can’t work to retire earlier.”  Image: PA  And Jan Shortt of the National Pensioners Convention added: “The longer you work the more ill you become and the less likely you are to even reach retirement age.”  The Centre for Social Justice is chaired by ex-Welfare Secretary and Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith and Tory governments get many of their ideas from it.  In 2009 it dreamed up Universal Credit , adopted as policy by PM David Cameron a year later.  Its boss Andy Cook insists: “Working longer potentially improves health and wellbeing– we don’t do enough to help older people stay in work.  The state pension doesn’t reflect healthy working life expectancy.”  Image: Getty  The report also claims that a million pension-age Britons want to work, but can’t find bosses who will employ them.  It suggests a system of “mid-life MOTs” for older staff, leading to flexible hours and special training for those who stay in work.”  A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: “Everyone’s State Pension age is unique to them and in 2017 we raised the future retirement age to 68 so that it is sustainable now and for future generations.  We’re creating opportunities for people of all generations with record employment.”	Tory's plan to raise the state pension age to 75 over the next 16 years	false
c38d575e	Plastic straws and drink stirrers, and cotton buds with plastic stems will be banned from sale and use in England from next April, the government has confirmed.  The move, which has been in the offing for more than a year, is hoped to vastly reduce the litter and other environmental impacts of the nearly 5bn plastic straws currently used each year in England, along with more than 300m plastic stirrers and close to 2bn cotton buds with plastic stems.  Huge numbers of these items, particularly cotton buds, are flushed down toilets or otherwise end up in litter – surveys have recently found waterways across the UK teeming with plastic, putting wildlife at risk.  Alternatives are available, including serving drinks without straws or stirrers, which is preferable, or using paper straws and biodegradable products in place of plastic stirrers and cotton buds. The only exceptions to the new rule will be for people with a medical need or disability, for whom plastic straws and other materials will be available upon request.  The EU is also moving to phase out plastics in various forms.  A government consultation found that more than 80% of respondents supported a ban on the distribution and sale of plastic straws, while nine out of 10 people wanted a ban on drink stirrers, and a similar number supported a ban on plastic-handled cotton buds.  Registered pharmacies will be permitted to sell plastic straws, over the counter or online, but restaurants, pubs and other catering establishments will not be allowed to display plastic straws or provide them automatically.  Michael Gove, the environment secretary, said: “Urgent and decisive action is needed to tackle plastic pollution. These items are often used for just a few minutes, but take hundreds of years to break down.”  Campaigners welcomed the government’s move. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, which campaigns against plastic pollution, said: “Stopping the production and distribution of these single-use plastic menaces will prevent them from polluting beaches nationwide. It’s a really positive and bold step in the right direction against plastic pollution.”  However, the items expected to be banned were only part of the plastic problem, said Emma Priestland, campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “These three items are just a fraction of the single-use nasties that are used for a tiny amount of time before polluting the environment for centuries to come,” she said.  “Ultimately, we need producers to take responsibility for the plastic pollution caused by all their products, whether it’s bags, balloons, packets, containers or otherwise. That’s why we’re campaigning for legislation to cut back on pointless plastic across the board.”	Plastic straws, cotton buds and drink stirrers to be banned in England	false
7b9e930d	The use of cocaine in Britain has doubled in seven years, as one in 50 Londoners currently snorts the drug daily.  An analysis of Britain's waste water, carried out by forensic scientists at King's College London, has also proved that the purity of the class A drug has gone up, hitting a record high.  Tests of the drug in sewage show Londoners are taking almost 200,000 doses of cocaine every day, which amounts to about £700,000.  The research found that one in 50 Londoners currently takes the drug on a daily basis  Concentrations in waste water are 900 milligrams per 1,000 of the population per day, which rose from 392 milligrams per 1,000 in 2011.  The average cocaine dose through smoking or snorting is 40 milligrams, meaning that, in a population of nine million people, one in 50 is taking the class A drug on a daily basis.  The research also found out that the use of cocaine in London is almost as high during weekdays as it is at the weekend.  The use of cocaine in London is almost as high during the week as it is at the weekend  Last year, the Global Drug Survey reported that the British capital is one of cities in the world where cocaine can be delivered faster than pizza, thanks to the use of smartphones and encrypted messaging services.  London, Bristol, Barcelona, Antwerp, Zurich and Amsterdam are considered the top cities in Europe for the use of cocaine.  A study carried out by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in 2015 found that London was the city with the highest concentration of cocaine in its sewage in Europe.  Cocaine purity is soaring thanks to the increased supply and production in Latin America  Traces of the drug have been found in fish and shrimps in Suffolk.  A study published last summer found that endangered eels could become 'hyperactive' because of the presence of drugs in Britain's waters.  Biologists at the University of Naples Federico II also found that the the drugs accumulate in the animals' brains, muscles, gills and skin.  Dr Leon Barron, who led the latest analysis at King's College London, said the purity of cocaine has also risen through the increased supply and production in Latin America.  Recent research by the National Crime Agency confirmed cocaine purity is at 'historically high levels'.  Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police commissioner, said cocaine users often fuel gang violence and knife crime.  Pure cocaine is sold for about £100 per gram on the street.  Cocaine seizures have trebled in five hears, from 42.8 tons in 2013-14 to 122.9 tons in 2017-18, The Telegraph reported.

A study by the Action for Rail campaign showed that season tickets and other regulated fares had increased by 25% since 2010, while average pay went up by 9%.  Government plans to cap annual rises in regulated fares will cost taxpayers around £700 million over the next five years, but bigger savings could be passed on to passengers if train services were run by the public sector, said the report.  Season tickets could be 10% cheaper by 2017 if routes coming up for tender were given to public sector organisations, it was claimed.  TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “Rail fares have rocketed over the last five years leaving many commuters seriously out of pocket.  “If ministers really want to help hard-pressed commuters they need to return services to the public sector. This is a fair, more sustainable option and it would allow much bigger savings to be passed on to passengers. Introducing an arbitrary cap on fares is simply passing the bill on to taxpayers.  Image: PA  “The Government wants the public to subsidise train companies’ profits and bear the cost of the fares cap.”  Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan said: “Once more, those who claim they want to make work pay devalue that statement with continual, excessive and unreasonable increases in fares.”  Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said: “While train companies threaten to throw guards off their services and axe station staff who are essential for safety, turning the network into a paradise for criminals and yobs, they are milking the travelling public for all they can through extortionate fares.  “Every penny of the fare rip-off is sucked out of the system in fat company profits, while crucial rail maintenance and upgrade works are shelved for lack of funds.  “That’s the price of two decades of rail privatisation and the whole rotten business needs to be swept away and replaced by a public railway under public control.”  TSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes said: “We have the most expensive rail fares in Europe and they have risen by over 200% on the most popular routes since privatisation 20 years ago.  “We should follow the European example and run a publicly owned railway for the benefit of the travelling public, not the private rail firms.”	Rail fares have risen five times faster than wages prompting call for renationalisation	true

No other country has such a deep relationship with the patch of ground out the back. And our gardens are not only good for our spirit, they are good for wildlife and the environment generally.  In a city our parks and gardens are its lungs and life would be a greyer place without them. Yet Labour along with similar proposals from the Greens and Lib Dems proposes to introduce a Land Value Tax LVT – hereafter called the “garden tax”, which will be based on three per cent of the value of land for each property. For many homeowners this could represent a massive increase in their annual tax bill and force the sale of gardens in order to reduce bills. Grasping property developers will be keen to grab the land for new developments. It is unthinkable that this should be allowed to happen: the destruction of precious gardens that bring happiness and tranquillity as a means of paying for Labour’s irresponsible promises to the electorate.

d917caca	Wearing shoes that are too loose can be dangerous as they can impact the way you control your motor vehicle.  As the weather gets warmer us Brits get out our flip flops.  But those of us who choose to drive in their summer shoes could find themselves in trouble if they're involved in an accident.  Driving in flip flops is not illegal but wearing them could lead to a careless driving charge if they impact your ability to drive safely.  Under Rule 97 of the Highway Code, drivers are advised they must have footwear and clothing which does not prevent you using the controls in the correct manner.  Flip flops could slip off your foot, become wedged under pedals or prevent you from pressing the pedals with enough force to brake quickly, which could cause you to drive erratically or even lead to a crash.  If you get stopped by police while driving in a dangerous manner or your footwear is a reason for an accident, you could be charged with driving without due care and attention careless driving.  The careless driving fine carries a £100 on-the-spot fine and three penalty points on your licence.  If a more serious case, or it gets contested in court, the charge can attract a maximum £5,000 fine, up to nine penalty points and even a court-imposed driving ban.  A study by insurance brand ingenie previously found a huge 27 per cent of motorists could be risking this penalty as they wear flip flops behind the wheel.  RAC's guidelines for suitable driving footwear According to the RAC there are some guidelines for what footwear is suitable when driving: Have a sole no thicker than 10mm, but the sole should not be too thin or soft.  Provide enough grip to stop your foot slipping off the pedals.  Not be too heavy.  Not limit ankle movement.  Be narrow enough to avoid accidentally depressing two pedals at once.  Neil Greig, IAM RoadSmart Director of Policy and Research, told Sun Motors: “Before setting off, you should ensure that clothing and footwear do not prevent you using the controls in the correct manner.  “If flip flops stopped you being in control you could be prosecuted, as you are breaking Highway Code Rule 97.  Careless driving is mostly judged on the impact your driving has on others around you, so if you are spotted swerving or braking erratically and then stopped and found to have inadequate footwear, you could be prosecuted.  If you do cause a crash, then it could also be an aggravating factor against you in court and lead to a slightly higher fine or longer ban.”    Make sure you wear the correct footwear to drive this summer.

ff204eb9	Urgent action needed to save ‘dying’ high streets as new Labour analysis reveals 100,000 retail jobs have been lost in 3 years  Labour is calling on the government to save Britain’s ‘dying’ high streets as new figures released by the party reveal 100,000 retail jobs have been lost in 3 years.  New analysis by Labour of ONS figures released on Tuesday has revealed that a staggering 100,000 retail jobs have been lost in stores across Britain since 2015, as real wages have stagnated and the Government’s botched handling of the Brexit negotiations has hit consumer and business confidence.  Along with reform to the business rates system to ease the burden on traditional high streets and town centres, Rebecca Long Bailey, Labour’s Shadow Business Secretary, has called on the Government to consider:  Establishing a register of landlords of empty shops in each local authority, to make it easier to bring boarded up shops back into use  Launching an inquiry into excessive car parking charges levied by private firms, to examine the benefits of promoting free parking in city centres  2018 has seen numerous major high street brands fall into administration or announce store closures, including House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer, Mothercare and New Look. Research by the British Retail Consortium has revealed nearly a fifth of British retailers are planning to cut the number of people they employ in the next three months.  A report by PwC and the Local Data Company found that last year 4,000 High Street shops opened and 5,800 closed, a net loss of 1,800. Currently 11.35% of shops are empty, and the Local Data Company has found that 52% of former BHS stores still lie empty 2 years after the final closure.  Research by XLN last year found nine in ten people would visit high streets more often if free parking was offered. A third of respondents picked expensive parking and the lack of free parking as their biggest high street frustrations.  The British Retail Consortium has reported that 94 per cent of people surveyed say they miss the community feel of their high street.  Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Labour’s Shadow Business Secretary, said:  “Our high streets are dying but the Government isn’t doing anything about it.  “Losing giants like House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer and New Look from town centres across the country is alarming.  “Our communities, hundreds of thousands of jobs, and our economy, both local and national, depend on thriving high streets.

The delay in making a decision over where to build a new runway is costing the UK up to £6m a day, a report by a cross-party Commons body claims.  The British Infrastructure Group BIG, headed by Conservative MP Grant Shapps, urged new prime minister Theresa May to show her mettle by ending the speculation.  Its report entitled Gate Now Closing , which was published on Sunday July 24, calls for an urgent and immediate decision on hub airport expansion.  The report does not state where group thinks a new runway should be built, but it argues that the indecision is having a deleterious effect on Britain's businesses, the economy and jobs.  'Problem of capacity... causing substantial damage'  The problem of capacity at the current hub, Heathrow, is causing substantial damage to the industry as a whole, the report says.  It erodes confidence in the Government's stated ambition of growing the economy and our international trade.  The evidence has been gathered by the Airports Commission. Now a decision is needed, to show the new leadership's mettle.  The Airports Commission last summer recommended building a third runway at Heathrow over a second landing strip at Gatwick.  Still no date for Heathrow announcement  The Government's decision was initially delayed last year when further environmental studies were commissioned , and then in June following the outcome of the EU referendum.  The Department for Transport has not indicated when a decision is likely, following Chris Grayling's appointment as the new transport secretary.  Theresa May's election as prime minister, and the appointment to her cabinet of a number of Heathrow opponents , saw one bookmaker slash the odds on Gatwick winning the battle for a new runway.

d8c5eecd	Teachers who leave the profession for other jobs are taking substantial pay cuts, a new study published tonight reveals.  The research by the NFER National Foundation for Educational Research looked at teachers who left for different occupations over the past 14 years and found that, on average, their pay dropped by 10 per cent, compared with those who stayed in teaching.  It reveals that some teachers – who left to become teaching assistants or who took up a job in the public sector – saw a drop in their wages of up to 30 per cent.  Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said she knew of a teacher who had become a bus driver because they felt “anything was preferable to the lack of quality of life” that came with teaching.  “The fact that teachers are taking lower paid jobs reflects the desperation that many teachers feel, she said. The relentless nature of the workload and pressure is leading to teachers just walking. They can see no way they can remain in teaching and so they lose professional status and money.”  But the NFER analysis, of the government Labour Force Survey LFS data, can only indicate how the teachers' pay has changed in the short term as the LFS only follows up individuals for one year.  The Should I Stay or Should I Go? report concludes: “The short-term pay benefits from a career move may be limited by the need to prove value to new employers and develop skills for a different career. The prospect of higher pay in the longer-term may still have been a motivation for some teachers who left teaching.”  The report added that it is “possible that career-changers from other professions experience a similar fall in wages and this phenomenon is not likely to be unique to teaching.”  According to the research, more than half 51 per cent of teachers who leave teaching take up jobs in the education sector excluding those who leave to retire.  Carole Willis, NFER chief executive, said: “Recruiting and retaining good quality teachers is a key issue facing the education system over the next five to 10 years. Understanding the types of jobs former teachers are going into and their underlying motivations is crucial for formulating an appropriate policy response.”  The NFER analysed a sample of 6,896 teachers, including 936 who left teaching and 774 who joined teaching, over a 14-year period 2001-2015.

Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  There is no strong evidence that children under ten have passed coronavirus onto adults, researchers have suggested.  Young children do not play a significant role in spreading the virus and are significantly less likely to become infected than adults, according to a review of existing research into Covid-19 and children by the Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health RCPCH said.  It worked with other research teams to examine the correlation in studies of transmission from children to adults after public health officials in Switzerland said today under-10s could finally hug their grandparents again as they pose no risk to them.  The review, by the Don't Forget the Bubbles paediatric research project, stated: Notably, the China/WHO joint commission could not recall episodes during contact tracing where transmission occurred from a child to an adult.  Image: REUTERS  But the review also urged caution as it is still unknown whether children have passed on the virus, particularly given large numbers of asymptomatic cases.  A nine-year-old British boy who contracted coronavirus in a French Alps did not pass it on, despite having contact with more than 170 people at three schools. This case was studied as part of the research.  Dr Alasdair Munro, the clinical research fellow in paediatric infectious diseases who led the research, said: Covid-19 appears to affect children less often, and with less severity, including frequent asymptomatic or sub-clinical infection.  There is evidence of critical illness, but it is rare.  The role of children in transmission is unclear, but it seems likely they do not play a significant role.  Professor Russell Viner, the president of the RCPCH, said: From around the world, we are not seeing evidence that children are involved in spreading or transmitting the virus, but we do not have enough evidence.  Prof Viner added that it was too soon to say children could hug their grandparents, particularly as the over-70s are the most vulnerable.  Note: Children are not believed to play a significant role in the spread of coronavirus. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a study had found no cases of children passing coronavirus to an adult exist.

542709e6	The number of would-be students applying to university has fallen by 25,000 since last year, with experts blaming Brexit and funding changes for the fall. Overall, 649,700 people applied to university by June 30 - the last deadline for applications, down around 4% compared with this point last year. A breakdown shows a 4% decrease in UK applicants, while the number of EU students planning to study at a UK university or college has fallen by 5%, the Press Association reported. However, there has been a 2% rise in international students from countries outside the EU.  FatCamera via Getty Images Applications to UK universities have fallen by 25,000 since 2016  Across the UK, the numbers applying to go into higher education have fallen by 5% in England, 4% in Northern Ireland, 1% in Scotland and 5% in Wales. But the statistics do show that the proportion of 18-year-olds in England applying to universities has reached a new high, with 37.9% planning to study for a degree, up from 37.2% in 2016. Dame Julia Goodfellow, president of vice-chancellors’ group Universities UK, said: “These figures confirm what we know already from UCAS about application figures for this year. There are several possible reasons behind the drop in numbers. “Last year was a record high for applications, and factors such as Brexit and changes to the way degrees in nursing, midwifery and some other allied health professions in England are funded, could also be having an impact. “There has also been a fall in the number of 18 and 19-year-olds across the UK population since 2010. “This group makes up over half of all UK applicants to universities. The rate of applications from this age group, however, is at record levels, highlighting continued demand for university courses.” She added: “We recognise there are a number of issues to address. Continuing to communicate to European applicants that they are welcome and enrich our education system is important. “The decline in part-time and mature student entrants must also be addressed. “We recognise also the concern about the total cost of going to university. Any analysis needs to cover the cost of maintenance and the interest rate on the loans.” The figures come amid a growing debate on the future of tuition fees, which currently stand at a maximum of £9,250 a year, sparked by a Labour General Election pledge to scrap the charges.

The Labour leader joined Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, SNP MPs, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and ex-Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to back the motion on its first day in Parliament.  So far 28 MPs have signed the motion, drawn up by the Lib Dems, to stop legal changes to disability benefit Personal Independence Payment PIP.  Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Debbie Abrahams, who has reported the PIP shake-up to the United Nations, has also signed the motion against the law.  Ministers drew up emergency laws to combat two tribunals which said PIP - which funds disabled people's living costs - should be widened.  The tribunals said people who suffer overwhelming psychological distress when they leave home should get more cash.  That includes those with autism, dementia, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress and depression.  Tory MP Heidi Allen warned ministers have a duty to honour the tribunals and the Bow Group, a Tory think tank, said ignoring them gives the Conservative Party a bad name.  Yet the government refused to back down - saying to do so would cost taxpayers £3.7bn by 2022.  And Tory MP Mr Freeman sparked outrage by claiming the bizarre judgements had simply helped people who take pills at home who suffer from anxiety.  Despite the support for the motion it faces a struggle to be accepted - and the last time a similar one succeeded was in 1979.  The legal shake-up is happening via a Statutory Instrument subject to negative resolution, an obscure piece of law that can only be blocked if MPs pray against it.  The law came into effect instantly on February 23, but under Westminster's bizarre system, can be annulled if the House of Commons votes to back a prayer within 40 days and nights.  Labour and the Lib Dems both submitted a formal prayer to Commons authorities today, and the Lib Dems' - which arrived first - was selected for debate.  Being signed by the Leader of the Opposition makes a prayer more likely to be considered for debate.  But they are still not always guaranteed time in the Commons, even if there is widespread support for them.

cf0ae5c6	The average convicted criminal serving a short prison sentence has previously carried out more than 55 offences, police figures reveal.  Some repeat offenders are being sent to jail for the first time after committing 100 or more different crimes, according to the data.  The numbers – slipped out by ministers this month – suggest that most criminals going to prison have already been convicted of multiple offences in the past.  The i politics newsletter cut through the noise Email address is invalid Thank you for subscribing! Sorry, there was a problem with your subscription.  Conservative MPs claimed the revelation proves the justice system is too soft on offenders, while reformers accused the Government of failing to rehabilitate criminals and relying too much on prisons.  Offences history  In response to a written question from Tory backbencher Philip Davies, the Ministry of Justice said that the average man given a jail sentence of less than six months had committed 56.6 offences resulting in a conviction or caution, while women in the same position had 60.4 previous offences.  The figures also showed that last year, there was one offender who had carried out 93 different crimes before being sent to jail for the first time. In 2018, at least two first-time prisoners had previously been convicted of more than 100 offences.  The data come from the Police National Computer, which covers all police forces across the UK.  Mr Davies, the MP for Shipley, told i: “These figures absolutely destroy the liberal-leftie orthodoxy on the criminal justice system. Before people are given a short prison sentence they are given community sentence after community sentence, and this is proof that community sentences don’t work.”  But Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran argued that the data “expose a systemic failure to rehabilitate those convicted of crimes, and to prevent reoffending”. She added: “It is deeply hypocritical of the Government to talk tough on crime and grandstand on police numbers, whilst also failing to invest in rehabilitation and prevention initiatives.”  Andrew Neilson of the Howard League for Penal reform added: “Sending people to prison for short spells is particularly ineffective, as these figures reveal. Most people serving short prison sentences have done so before, and will almost certainly do so again. It simply isn’t working.”  The Minister of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.

Data released by HM Revenue and Customs shows the number of children in low-income families rose from 2.5million to 2.75million between 2013 and 2014.  It means the overall proportion of kids in struggling households has now hit 20% - or one in five of all children.  Furious charity campaigners and Labour MP accused the Tories of failing to protect the most vulnerable kids in society.  Imran Hussain, director of policy for the Child Poverty Action Group, said: “Child poverty figures are the best measure we have for whether we really are ‘all in it together’.  Image: Getty  “What’s clear from these grim figures is that more and more children are being left behind in poverty, missing out on the childhoods and life chances other kids take for granted.  “With two thirds of poor children in working families it’s scandalous that the Government isn’t looking to reverse the devastating cuts targeting working families in the new Universal Credit benefit.“  Debbie Abrahams, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, added: “It is deeply shocking to see that 250,000 more children are living in low income households including families who are in work.  “Our children should not pay the price for the Tories’ failing austerity agenda.  “Under Labour we made great leaps towards ending child poverty. This Government’s warm words will no longer disguise the misery their policies are inflicting.”  Image: Getty  The HMRC report classes children in low-income families as those either in receipt of out-of-work benefits, or those in receipt of tax credits with an income less than 60% of the national average.  HMRC said the results were down to poorer people’s incomes failing to keep up with those enjoying pay rises - but insisted their actual incomes may not have fallen in all cases.  “The Government is committed to delivering a country that works for everyone – not just the privileged few,” a Government spokesman said.  “This includes taking action to help the most disadvantaged through tackling the root causes, not just the symptoms, of poverty.”	Number of children living in poverty has soared by 250,000 under Tory government	partially false
8febabd8	It was the death of Sheku Bayoh in 2015 that spurred me into action: in an attempt to add black British voices to the ongoing story of worldwide police brutality, I’ve teamed up with filmmaker Troy James Aidoo to create the documentary film 1500 And Counting. We have been working with members of the Bayoh family and organizations to put a spotlight on the criminal behaviour of officers, in an attempt to shake British people out of their current state of complacency. If we cannot trust the state to police us fairly, then we are all walking targets. Time and time again, we see a similar pattern in the stories of black victims of police brutality: they are often vulnerable usually suffering from mental illness, arrested by several officers, and brute force is used to detain them.  The making of 1500 And Counting led me to ask what has really changed since the 1980s—a time when skinheads ruled the streets and terrorized immigrants, and now-abolished 'sus' laws allowed police officers to profile black men and boys, searching and brutalizing them for no particular reason. Although the Race Relations Act was initially introduced to outlaw racial discrimination in the U.K. in 1965, and was extended to apply to the police in the ‘90s, not much has improved. If we examine any area of British life, we will see significant racial inequalities. The unemployment rate for ethnic minorities in the U.K. is 11.3%, more than twice that of white people 5.5%. Depressingly, black people are almost three times as likely to be unemployed than anyone else in the U.K., with 38% of young black men currently unemployed compared to 17.8% of young white men. Healthcare is another area where gross inequality exists: Black people are 44% more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act than their white counterparts.  Black people are more disproportionately represented in U.K. prisons than in the U.S. The proportion of black people in jail in the U.K. is almost seven times their share of the population, whereas in the U.S. the proportion of black prisoners is four times greater than their population share. And terrifyingly, police officers have used routine arrests to collect the DNA profile of three-quarters of young black British men between the ages of 18 and 35.

7212bc8a	The Labour Party has accused the Government of failing patients after the Chancellor buried a £30 billion cut to day to day spending in the Department of Health and Social Care, as waiting lists hit a record high.  Leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer will visit a hospital in Derby this morning Thursday, as Budget documents revealed a planned cut in day to day spending in the Department of Health and Social Care of £30.1 billion from April this year.  It comes as new analysis published by the Labour Party reveals that:  The number of patients waiting more than 18 weeks for treatment has increased by over 500% over the last decade.  Almost a quarter of a million people are waiting more than a year for treatment.  An estimated 4.59 million people are currently on the waiting list for treatment – the highest ever number on record.  Even before the pandemic hit, the number of people waiting more than 18 weeks had spiralled over the previous nine years, to over 720,000 in December 2019.  Only 68% of patients on the waiting list have been waiting 18 weeks or less – the statutory target for 92% of patients to receive treatment within 18 weeks of referral has not been met since 2016.  The figures include patients waiting for hip and knee replacements and cataract removals, among many other procedures and treatments vital to people’s quality of life.  NHS England spending will fall from £147.7 billion this year to £139.1 billion from next despite the ongoing costs to the NHS from Covid and the huge backlog of cases and waiting lists that have built up during the crisis.  In November, the Health Foundation estimated that clearing the backlogs and reducing waiting times would cost around £2 billion a year over the next three years.  Commenting on the findings, Jonathan Ashworth MP, Shadow Health and Social Care Secretary, said:  “The Chancellor is failing patients, our NHS and its staff by cutting frontline services during a pandemic.  “With lists already at a record high, this will mean patients waiting even longer in pain for vital treatment.  “Yesterday’s Budget papered over the cracks rather than rebuilding the foundations of our country.”	Chancellor failing patients with his £30 billion NHS cut as waiting lists hit record high	false
48026a71	A ndy Murray served up an ace to John Inverdale after the BBC presenter made a gaffe about women tennis players.  Fresh from his triumph at Rio, Murray was praised by Inverdale for apparently becoming the first person to win two Olympic gold medals for tennis.  But the singles champion quickly realised the presenter was forgetting the existence of the Williams sisters, telling him: Venus and Serena have won four each.”  It came after Murray defeated Argentina’s Juan Martin Del Potro to win his second gold after a gruelling four-hour match on Sunday night.  His triumph made him the first man to win back-to-back singles gold medals at the Olympics.  John Inverdale's latest blunder came during a post-match interview with Andy Murray / Getty  London mayor Sadiq Khan, who tweeted a clip of Murray receiving his medal, also made the blunder.  He wrote: “National anthem time for @Andy_Murray - first player EVER to win 2 x #GOLD in #Olympics #tennis #Rio2016.”  Tennis fans were quick to praise Murray on social media for the quip.  Timeline of Andy Murray's greatest tennis victories  Gillian Laird tweeted: Well done @andy_murray - for both the gold & putting John Inverdale in his place.  Another user named Phi wrote: #AndyMurray should get another medal for reminding John Inverdale of the existence of women.  Julie Bull posted: Good to see someone standing up for the girls because it's never going to be John Inverdale.  It is the latest in a series of blunders from Inverdale who has had two on-air spats with rowing legend and fellow presenter Sir Steve Redgrave.  Sir Steve stormed off in the middle of a live broadcast after apparently growing annoyed at not having the chance to speak.  The pair had another bust-up when Inverdale stopped a New Zealand rower for a chat only for Redgrave to interrupt him and stop the interview, saying New Zealand TV needed to speak to single sculls Olympic champion Mahe Drysdale first.  In another on-screen blunder at the Olympics on Wednesday, a commentator joked about not wanting to see two men kissing.

0b9f0803	Fast food outlets should be banned from opening within 400 metres of schools in England, according to leading child doctors.  The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health urged the government to introduce the measure as part of its updated childhood obesity strategy, published this summer.  The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has suggested a ban on any new fast food outlets being built within such distance and the college called for this to be extended across the UK.  Prof Russell Viner, the president of the college, said ministers should “take a leap of faith” and introduce the measures to make it easier for councils to keep junk food away from students.  In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, he said: “Kids are coming out of school hungry and finding themselves surrounded by cheap chicken shops, chip shops and other types of junk food. This just wasn’t the case 20 or 30 years ago.  “People tend to eat what’s in front of them and we need to make it easier for children to make the right choices.”  Viner said local authorities needed increased powers to make it easier to bring in such bans. A number of councils have introduced these measures, but others said they faced too much red tape.    It comes as data shows that almost a third of children aged two to 15 are overweight or obese and younger generations are becoming obese at earlier ages and staying obese for longer.    In May, the Commons health and social care committee will open hearings for an inquiry on childhood obesity, examining areas that they should take action.  The college also proposed that there be a national programme to weigh and measure children from birth through to their teenage years. It called for GPs to be given training in how to talk to parents about children who gain weight.    “We need to be prepared to have difficult conversations and to make every contact [with health services] count in the fight against obesity,” Viner said.  He added: “We have to take a leap of faith to protect current and future generations.”	Ministers urged to ban fast food outlets from opening near schools	false
7ffcc643	The body, which scrutinises public spending on behalf of parliament, called for better protection for at risk gamblers.  It said the government should look at the way the regulator, the Gambling Commission, is funded.  The Commission said it agreed that more needed to be done.  The NAO report said that licensed gambling - excluding the National Lottery - had increased by 57% over the past decade.  Much of this rise, it said, was due to an increase in licensed online gambling, which rose sharply in November 2014 when a change in regulations meant all online gambling needed to be licensed, including firms based overseas.      William Hill site penalised over gambling addicts     The people most likely to have a gambling problem     Gambling links with football have 'gone too far'     Gambling on credit cards to be banned  The Gambling Commission is a small regulator in a huge and fast-evolving industry. While the Commission has made improvements, gambling regulation lags behind the industry, said Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO.  The Commission estimates 1.8 million people are at risk gamblers and 395,000 are problem gamblers, including 55,000 children. Gambling addiction can lead to mental health problems and severe financial difficulties.  A spokesperson for the Gambling Commission said: We agree with the report's assessment that we face the significant challenge of regulating a dynamic and developing industry.  It was already discussing proposals to reform its funding model with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, it added.  The Commission received £19m of funding in 2018-19, almost all of which came from the licence fees charged to operators, the NAO's report said.  The organisation does not have the power to increase the licence fees it charges, making it difficult to invest in new skills to respond to developments in the industry, the watchdog said.  The fees are set through secondary legislation by the government every four years.  	At-risk gamblers 'need better protection'	partially false

Alleged offences included rape, child prostitution and grooming.  In total, some 4,643 sexual offences were reported at schools during the four years.      Sexual harassment and violence in schools is commonplace     Plan International UK's Lucy Russell     Children’s charity Plan International UK, which gathered the figures, called the findings alarming and demanded the Government makes relationship education compulsory to tackle aggressive sexual behaviour.  The charity’s Lucy Russell said: ““We are very concerned about these findings.  “Sadly we are not really shocked because we have heard from girls that sexual harassment and violence in schools is commonplace.  It is something they are really worried about.” Ms Russell said harassment in schools is often viewed as a joke with girls “expected to put up with it”.  But she warned: “Every time you get away with something it means you can try the next stage.”  Schools must tell pupils unwanted touching and sexual name calling is harassment, she said. Sixty-six per cent of alleged victims were female with 94 per cent of the reported offences committed by males.  Reported cases in England included a five-year-old girl said to have assaulted a boy and a lad of five accused of sexual activity involving a girl.  Welsh police investigated claims a five-year-old boy had sexual activity with a girl, five.  Thirty-four police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland supplied figures.

e91bcd49	The number and proportion of NHS hospital patients in England waiting more than 18 weeks to begin treatment have risen to their highest levels in almost seven years, official statistics show.  In February, nearly 40,000 admitted patients did not start consultant-led treatment within 18 weeks of referral, and more than 13,000 waited more than 26 weeks. The target is for 90% to receive treatment within 18 weeks but only 87% did so.  The only worse performance – for both percentage and absolute number – since records began in March 2008 was in April of that year when 86.7% began treatment within 18 weeks. That meant just over 40,000 were kept waiting beyond that period.  The figures show that the median waiting time reached a record 10 weeks in February, up from 8.4 weeks at the time of the last election.  The shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, accused the Tories of breaking their promises on the NHS. “David Cameron promised to keep waiting times low but today’s figures show his plan for the NHS has failed,” he said. “His reorganisation dragged the NHS down to the point where it can no longer meet waiting time targets despite inheriting lists at a record low.”  At the time of the last election, 92.9% of hospital patients were beginning consultant-led treatment within 18 weeks of referral, meaning just over 20,000 were kept waiting beyond that period.    The NHS is also supposed to ensure that 95% of outpatients start treatment within 18 weeks of referral, but in February the figure was 94.7%, the lowest since June 2008. Nearly 45,000 were still waiting after 18 weeks, a lower number than in both October and November last year.  An NHS England spokesman said: “In February the NHS made further strides in cutting long waits, with the number of patients who waited over a year slashed from over 5,000 three years ago to being in the hundreds now, and with the average wait for an operation being just 10 weeks.”	NHS hospital waiting time figures worst in seven years	partially false
e7d84dfa	The government spends around £50 billion a year to support people with disabilities and health conditions.  Part of that support comes through Personal Independence Payment  PIP . This was introduced to replace the outdated Disability Living Allowance and helps with the extra costs that can often come with being disabled, such as added transport costs or assistance with cooking.  The PIP assessment is designed to focus more support on those who are likely to have a higher level of need, and higher costs associated with their disability. For example, claimants who require therapy at home, like dialysis or oxygen, are likely to need more support than someone who needs help to take medication. Similarly, people who cannot carry out a journey because of a visual or cognitive impairment are likely to need more support than someone who experiences psychological distress when they undertake a journey, for example as a result of social phobia or anxiety.  Recent legal judgments have interpreted the assessment criteria for PIP in ways that are different to what was originally intended. The government is now making amendments to clarify the criteria, to restore the original aim of the policy and ensure support goes to those most in need.  This is not a policy change and will not result in any claimants seeing a reduction in the amount of PIP previously awarded by the Department for Work and Pensions  DWP . The purpose is to restore the original intention of the benefit which has been expanded by the legal judgments.  Spending on disability benefits has risen by more than £3 billion in real terms since 2010, and will remain higher in each year to 2020, than in 2010. Failing to reinstate the original intention of the policy would have led to substantial unplanned increases to public expenditure totalling £3.7 billion between 2016 to 2017 and 2021 to 2022.

534b565c	The NHS will be off the table in any US-UK trade negotiations, the government said on Monday as it set itself limited ambitions for a future trade deal with Washington.  Publishing its mandate for negotiations, the government appeared to bow to public pressure not to accept US farming methods, although trade experts said the British position left a small amount of wriggle room on shifting agricultural standards.  The NHS will not be on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. The services the NHS provides will not be on the table, the 184-page mandate says, allaying fears that a US trade deal would push up UK drug prices.  David Henig, the director of the UK Trade Policy Project at the European Centre for International Political Economy thinktank, said the negotiating objectives for a US trade deal were relatively modest and appeared designed to tick the box of a deal rather than deliver substantial gains.  They reflect concerns at the heart of government that a comprehensive deal is not economically worth the likely political trouble from farmers and environmental campaigners among others, Mr Henig said.  The government said it estimated the benefits of signing a US-UK trade deal would range from 0.16 per cent of additional GDP in 15 years at the upper end, down to 0.07 per cent of GDP if the deal liberalised trade less than hoped.  The US-UK objectives were released in London as a team of more than 100 UK trade negotiators opened talks in Brussels to try and seal a deal on the future EU-UK relationship before the December 31 deadline. The UK is seeking a Canada-style deal with the EU, which Treasury analysis estimates will lead to the British economy growing by 4.9 per cent less than would have otherwise been the case.

He said: “We can only effectively manage asylum and migration in Europe, and preserve the Schengen area, if we all work together in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility.”	 The Commission has threatened to fine member states – and slap mandatory quotas on them - unless they take part in the scheme.  Hungary’s hard line president Viktor Orban has refused and is putting the idea to a Referendum in the country on October 2.  Speaking two weeks ago, Jean Claude Juncker said he would ask Governments to find a way to reconcile those reluctant to take refugees with those who insist it is key to EU “solidarity”.

Liz Truss predicts that Britain’s economy will grow by £3.4 billion when a deal is signed, with the North East, Midlands and Scotland seeing the biggest uplift.  Boris Johnson said Britain will “drive a hard bargain” when it unveils its negotiating objectives on Monday. Talks will begin later this month, running in parallel with UK-EU trade negotiations.  The UK mandate keeps the NHS out of any deal and upholds British standards on food standards and animal welfare, meaning Britain will reject any attempt to sell chlorinated chicken or hormone-fed beef to the UK.  Among the sectors predicted to get the biggest boost from a transatlantic free trade agreement are ceramics factories, the car industry, food and drinks producers and professional services.  Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Ms Truss says: “More container ships will leave Liverpool, Glasgow and Belfast stacked high with UK goods, more British-made cars will travel on US highways and sub-Atlantic cables will buzz with the digital ingenuity of the UK’s soaring tech sector.  “It’s there for the taking, as are the benefits that this kind of expansion in our trading relationship can bring for people in every part of the UK.”	Workers 'to share in £1.8billion pay rise' if US trade deal comes off	partially false
069cf853	By Edward Spalton. This article irst appeared in the Derby Evening Telegraph on 10th October  Mr Cameron is, of course, quite right that the European Convention on Human Rights ECHR has been expanded to a parody of its original laudable intentions.  It once took many thousands of pounds from public funds to pay a lawyer, Cherie Blair, to take a case on behalf of a schoolgirl who did not want to wear her school uniform.  As long as he keeps us in the EU, Mr Cameron cannot get us out of obeying the ECHR.  In 2011, the EU Commission a separate body wrote: “Respect for fundamental rights as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights is an explicit obligation for the Union under article 6 3 of the Treaty on European Union… i.e., the Lisbon Treaty. …. The Court of Justice of the EU has held that the Convention is of special importance for determining the fundamental rights that must be respected by the member states.”  So, if Mr Cameron does run away from the European Court of Human Rights, the EU’s own Court of Justice will drag him back and compel his obedience to it. That is in the Lisbon Treaty, which is our country’s supreme constitution, overriding the Magna Carta, Queen, Lords and Commons as long as we remain in the EU. It is the same treaty on which “Cast Iron Cameron” promised us a referendum.	Only by leaving EU will we escape human rights legislation	true
282ff13b	More than 11,000 criminal trials in England and Wales had to be abandoned last year because witnesses pulled out or did not appear at court, a watchdog has said.  The figures have been released by HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate.  Defendants can be acquitted or see their trials rescheduled in such cases.  But the watchdog said too many domestic violence case witnesses were summonsed, which risked alienating victims who were willing to give evidence.  Failure to appear could result in a warrant for the witness's arrest.  In 2014-15, for various reasons, more than half of the 195,000 trials listed in magistrates and crown courts did not go ahead as planned, the report said. Defendants acquitted  The inspectorate found a rising number of prosecutions were cracked - which is the term used for a case that closes unexpectedly because a witness is absent or has withdrawn evidence.  This happened in nearly 800 crown court trials and in 10,600 hearings in magistrates' courts.  The report said that 2.1% of trials in the crown court and 6.8% of trials in the magistrates' court were cracked in 2014-15, compared with 1.8% and 6.3% respectively the previous year.

Claire Currie, co-author of the report, said alcohol was putting on pressure to an already stretched NHS.	A&E admissions for alcohol poisoning double with teen girls most at risk	false
cd7aee72	More than four million calls to the taxman are going unanswered, new figures show, as HM Revenue & Customs concedes the problem is almost twice as bad as previously disclosed.  More than one in 10 callers to HMRC fails to get through to anyone, compared with just over one in 20 a year ago, prompting criticism from MPs that the service is letting down millions of self-employed people.  The true scale of the problem is even worse than HMRC is prepared to admit, as its audit ignores taxpayers who get an engaged tone when they dial the tax advice helpline.  HMRC’s own figures also reveal that 14 per cent of calls took more than 10 minutes to answer, though that does not include the time people spend navigating its automated call handling service, which can add an extra four minutes to the length of a call.  In September, the month before the deadline for paper tax returns, one in five calls took more than 10 minutes to answer.  It comes despite HMRC’s claims that it has improved its performance following previous criticism of its tax advice telephone service.

The richest one percent of the UK population own more than 20 times more wealth than the poorest 20 percent combined.  The EU referendum vote was a stark illustration of just how polarized our society is, with millions of voters expressing their frustration at being locked out of politics and economic opportunity. It is encouraging then that Prime Minister Theresa May has committed to creating a society that works for everyone, not just the fortunate few.

It is, I promise, worse than you think. If your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible, even within the lifetime of a teenager today. And yet the swelling seas — and the cities they will drown — have so dominated the picture of global warming, and so overwhelmed our capacity for climate panic, that they have occluded our perception of other threats, many much closer at hand. Rising oceans are bad, in fact very bad; but fleeing the coastline will not be enough.  Indeed, absent a significant adjustment to how billions of humans conduct their lives, parts of the Earth will likely become close to uninhabitable, and other parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this century.  Even when we train our eyes on climate change, we are unable to comprehend its scope. This past winter, a string of days 60 and 70 degrees warmer than normal baked the North Pole, melting the permafrost that encased Norway’s Svalbard seed vault — a global food bank nicknamed “Doomsday,” designed to ensure that our agriculture survives any catastrophe, and which appeared to have been flooded by climate change less than ten years after being built.  Related Stories The Uninhabitable Earth, Annotated Edition  The Doomsday vault is fine, for now: The structure has been secured and the seeds are safe. But treating the episode as a parable of impending flooding missed the more important news. Until recently, permafrost was not a major concern of climate scientists, because, as the name suggests, it was soil that stayed permanently frozen. But Arctic permafrost contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon, more than twice as much as is currently suspended in the Earth’s atmosphere. When it thaws and is released, that carbon may evaporate as methane, which is 34 times as powerful a greenhouse-gas warming blanket as carbon dioxide when judged on the timescale of a century; when judged on the timescale of two decades, it is 86 times as powerful. In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.  Maybe you know that already — there are alarming stories in the news every day, like those, last month, that seemed to suggest satellite data showed the globe warming since 1998 more than twice as fast as scientists had thought (in fact, the underlying story was considerably less alarming than the headlines). Or the news from Antarctica this past May, when a crack in an ice shelf grew 11 miles in six days, then kept going; the break now has just three miles to go — by the time you read this, it may already have met the open water, where it will drop into the sea one of the biggest icebergs ever, a process known poetically as “calving.”  But no matter how well-informed you are, you are surely not alarmed enough. Over the past decades, our culture has gone apocalyptic with zombie movies and Mad Max dystopias, perhaps the collective result of displaced climate anxiety, and yet when it comes to contemplating real-world warming dangers, we suffer from an incredible failure of imagination. The reasons for that are many: the timid language of scientific probabilities, which the climatologist James Hansen once called “scientific reticence” in a paper chastising scientists for editing their own observations so conscientiously that they failed to communicate how dire the threat really was; the fact that the country is dominated by a group of technocrats who believe any problem can be solved and an opposing culture that doesn’t even see warming as a problem worth addressing; the way that climate denialism has made scientists even more cautious in offering speculative warnings; the simple speed of change and, also, its slowness, such that we are only seeing effects now of warming from decades past; our uncertainty about uncertainty, which the climate writer Naomi Oreskes in particular has suggested stops us from preparing as though anything worse than a median outcome were even possible; the way we assume climate change will hit hardest elsewhere, not everywhere; the smallness (two degrees) and largeness (1.8 trillion tons) and abstractness (400 parts per million) of the numbers; the discomfort of considering a problem that is very difficult, if not impossible, to solve; the altogether incomprehensible scale of that problem, which amounts to the prospect of our own annihilation; simple fear. But aversion arising from fear is a form of denial, too.  In between scientific reticence and science fiction is science itself. This article is the result of dozens of interviews and exchanges with climatologists and researchers in related fields and reflects hundreds of scientific papers on the subject of climate change. What follows is not a series of predictions of what will happen — that will be determined in large part by the much-less-certain science of human response. Instead, it is a portrait of our best understanding of where the planet is heading absent aggressive action. It is unlikely that all of these warming scenarios will be fully realized, largely because the devastation along the way will shake our complacency. But those scenarios, and not the present climate, are the baseline. In fact, they are our schedule.  The present tense of climate change — the destruction we’ve already baked into our future — is horrifying enough. Most people talk as if Miami and Bangladesh still have a chance of surviving; most of the scientists I spoke with assume we’ll lose them within the century, even if we stop burning fossil fuel in the next decade. Two degrees of warming used to be considered the threshold of catastrophe: tens of millions of climate refugees unleashed upon an unprepared world. Now two degrees is our goal, per the Paris climate accords, and experts give us only slim odds of hitting it. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issues serial reports, often called the “gold standard” of climate research; the most recent one projects us to hit four degrees of warming by the beginning of the next century, should we stay the present course. But that’s just a median projection. The upper end of the probability curve runs as high as eight degrees — and the authors still haven’t figured out how to deal with that permafrost melt. The IPCC reports also don’t fully account for the albedo effect (less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight, hence more warming); more cloud cover (which traps heat); or the dieback of forests and other flora (which extract carbon from the atmosphere). Each of these promises to accelerate warming, and the history of the planet shows that temperature can shift as much as five degrees Celsius within thirteen years. The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer, Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World, his new history of the planet’s major extinction events, the oceans were hundreds of feet higher.*  The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now, each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock, and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into. Unless you are a teenager, you probably read in your high-school textbooks that these extinctions were the result of asteroids. In fact, all but the one that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas. The most notorious was 252 million years ago; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees, accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic, and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead. We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably faster rate; by most estimates, at least ten times faster. The rate is accelerating. This is what Stephen Hawking had in mind when he said, this spring, that the species needs to colonize other planets in the next century to survive, and what drove Elon Musk, last month, to unveil his plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years. These are nonspecialists, of course, and probably as inclined to irrational panic as you or I. But the many sober-minded scientists I interviewed over the past several months — the most credentialed and tenured in the field, few of them inclined to alarmism and many advisers to the IPCC who nevertheless criticize its conservatism — have quietly reached an apocalyptic conclusion, too: No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster.  Over the past few decades, the term “Anthropocene” has climbed out of academic discourse and into the popular imagination — a name given to the geologic era we live in now, and a way to signal that it is a new era, defined on the wall chart of deep history by human intervention. One problem with the term is that it implies a conquest of nature (and even echoes the biblical “dominion”). And however sanguine you might be about the proposition that we have already ravaged the natural world, which we surely have, it is another thing entirely to consider the possibility that we have only provoked it, engineering first in ignorance and then in denial a climate system that will now go to war with us for many centuries, perhaps until it destroys us. That is what Wallace Smith Broecker, the avuncular oceanographer who coined the term “global warming,” means when he calls the planet an “angry beast.” You could also go with “war machine.” Each day we arm it more.  II. Heat Death  The bahraining of New York.  In the sugar­cane region of El Salvador, as much as one-fifth of the population has chronic kidney disease, the presumed result of dehydration from working the fields they were able to comfortably harvest as recently as two decades ago. Photo: Heartless Machine  Humans, like all mammals, are heat engines; surviving means having to continually cool off, like panting dogs. For that, the temperature needs to be low enough for the air to act as a kind of refrigerant, drawing heat off the skin so the engine can keep pumping. At seven degrees of warming, that would become impossible for large portions of the planet’s equatorial band, and especially the tropics, where humidity adds to the problem; in the jungles of Costa Rica, for instance, where humidity routinely tops 90 percent, simply moving around outside when it’s over 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be lethal. And the effect would be fast: Within a few hours, a human body would be cooked to death from both inside and out.  Climate-change skeptics point out that the planet has warmed and cooled many times before, but the climate window that has allowed for human life is very narrow, even by the standards of planetary history. At 11 or 12 degrees of warming, more than half the world’s population, as distributed today, would die of direct heat. Things almost certainly won’t get that hot this century, though models of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually. This century, and especially in the tropics, the pain points will pinch much more quickly even than an increase of seven degrees. The key factor is something called wet-bulb temperature, which is a term of measurement as home-laboratory-kit as it sounds: the heat registered on a thermometer wrapped in a damp sock as it’s swung around in the air (since the moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in dry air, this single number reflects both heat and humidity). At present, most regions reach a wet-bulb maximum of 26 or 27 degrees Celsius; the true red line for habitability is 35 degrees. What is called heat stress comes much sooner.  Related Stories Michael Oppenheimer: Only 10 Percent Chance We Meet Paris Targets  Actually, we’re about there already. Since 1980, the planet has experienced a 50-fold increase in the number of places experiencing dangerous or extreme heat; a bigger increase is to come. The five warmest summers in Europe since 1500 have all occurred since 2002, and soon, the IPCC warns, simply being outdoors that time of year will be unhealthy for much of the globe. Even if we meet the Paris goals of two degrees warming, cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become close to uninhabitable, annually encountering deadly heat waves like those that crippled them in 2015. At four degrees, the deadly European heat wave of 2003, which killed as many as 2,000 people a day, will be a normal summer. At six, according to an assessment focused only on effects within the U.S. from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the lower Mississippi Valley, and everybody in the country east of the Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone, anywhere, in the world today. As Joseph Romm has put it in his authoritative primer Climate Change: What Everyone Needs to Know, heat stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain, one of the planet’s hottest spots, and the temperature in Bahrain “would induce hyperthermia in even sleeping humans.” The high-end IPCC estimate, remember, is two degrees warmer still. By the end of the century, the World Bank has estimated, the coolest months in tropical South America, Africa, and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century. Air-conditioning can help but will ultimately only add to the carbon problem; plus, the climate-controlled malls of the Arab emirates aside, it is not remotely plausible to wholesale air-condition all the hottest parts of the world, many of them also the poorest. And indeed, the crisis will be most dramatic across the Middle East and Persian Gulf, where in 2015 the heat index registered temperatures as high as 163 degrees Fahrenheit. As soon as several decades from now, the hajj will become physically impossible for the 2 million Muslims who make the pilgrimage each year.  It is not just the hajj, and it is not just Mecca; heat is already killing us. In the sugarcane region of El Salvador, as much as one-fifth of the population has chronic kidney disease, including over a quarter of the men, the presumed result of dehydration from working the fields they were able to comfortably harvest as recently as two decades ago. With dialysis, which is expensive, those with kidney failure can expect to live five years; without it, life expectancy is in the weeks. Of course, heat stress promises to pummel us in places other than our kidneys, too. As I type that sentence, in the California desert in mid-June, it is 121 degrees outside my door. It is not a record high.  III. The End of Food  Praying for cornfields in the tundra.  Climates differ and plants vary, but the basic rule for staple cereal crops grown at optimal temperature is that for every degree of warming, yields decline by 10 percent. Some estimates run as high as 15 or even 17 percent. Which means that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them. And proteins are worse: It takes 16 calories of grain to produce just a single calorie of hamburger meat, butchered from a cow that spent its life polluting the climate with methane farts.  Pollyannaish plant physiologists will point out that the cereal-crop math applies only to those regions already at peak growing temperature, and they are right — theoretically, a warmer climate will make it easier to grow corn in Greenland. But as the pathbreaking work by Rosamond Naylor and David Battisti has shown, the tropics are already too hot to efficiently grow grain, and those places where grain is produced today are already at optimal growing temperature — which means even a small warming will push them down the slope of declining productivity. And you can’t easily move croplands north a few hundred miles, because yields in places like remote Canada and Russia are limited by the quality of soil there; it takes many centuries for the planet to produce optimally fertile dirt.  Drought might be an even bigger problem than heat, with some of the world’s most arable land turning quickly to desert. Precipitation is notoriously hard to model, yet predictions for later this century are basically unanimous: unprecedented droughts nearly everywhere food is today produced. By 2080, without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American dust bowl ever was. The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest of the Middle East; some of the most densely populated parts of Australia, Africa, and South America; and the breadbasket regions of China. None of these places, which today supply much of the world’s food, will be reliable sources of any. As for the original dust bowl: The droughts in the American plains and Southwest would not just be worse than in the 1930s, a 2015 NASA study predicted, but worse than any droughts in a thousand years — and that includes those that struck between 1100 and 1300, which “dried up all the rivers East of the Sierra Nevada mountains” and may have been responsible for the death of the Anasazi civilization.  Remember, we do not live in a world without hunger as it is. Far from it: Most estimates put the number of undernourished at 800 million globally. In case you haven’t heard, this spring has already brought an unprecedented quadruple famine to Africa and the Middle East; the U.N. has warned that separate starvation events in Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria, and Yemen could kill 20 million this year alone.  IV. Climate Plagues  What happens when the bubonic ice melts?  Rock, in the right spot, is a record of planetary history, eras as long as millions of years flattened by the forces of geological time into strata with amplitudes of just inches, or just an inch, or even less. Ice works that way, too, as a climate ledger, but it is also frozen history, some of which can be reanimated when unfrozen. There are now, trapped in Arctic ice, diseases that have not circulated in the air for millions of years — in some cases, since before humans were around to encounter them. Which means our immune systems would have no idea how to fight back when those prehistoric plagues emerge from the ice.  The Arctic also stores terrifying bugs from more recent times. In Alaska, already, researchers have discovered remnants of the 1918 flu that infected as many as 500 million and killed as many as 100 million — about 5 percent of the world’s population and almost six times as many as had died in the world war for which the pandemic served as a kind of gruesome capstone. As the BBC reported in May, scientists suspect smallpox and the bubonic plague are trapped in Siberian ice, too — an abridged history of devastating human sickness, left out like egg salad in the Arctic sun.  Experts caution that many of these organisms won’t actually survive the thaw and point to the fastidious lab conditions under which they have already reanimated several of them — the 32,000-year-old “extremophile” bacteria revived in 2005, an 8 million-year-old bug brought back to life in 2007, the 3.5 million–year–old one a Russian scientist self-injected just out of curiosity — to suggest that those are necessary conditions for the return of such ancient plagues. But already last year, a boy was killed and 20 others infected by anthrax released when retreating permafrost exposed the frozen carcass of a reindeer killed by the bacteria at least 75 years earlier; 2,000 present-day reindeer were infected, too, carrying and spreading the disease beyond the tundra.  What concerns epidemiologists more than ancient diseases are existing scourges relocated, rewired, or even re-evolved by warming. The first effect is geographical. Before the early-modern period, when adventuring sailboats accelerated the mixing of peoples and their bugs, human provinciality was a guard against pandemic. Today, even with globalization and the enormous intermingling of human populations, our ecosystems are mostly stable, and this functions as another limit, but global warming will scramble those ecosystems and help disease trespass those limits as surely as Cortés did. You don’t worry much about dengue or malaria if you are living in Maine or France. But as the tropics creep northward and mosquitoes migrate with them, you will. You didn’t much worry about Zika a couple of years ago, either.  As it happens, Zika may also be a good model of the second worrying effect — disease mutation. One reason you hadn’t heard about Zika until recently is that it had been trapped in Uganda; another is that it did not, until recently, appear to cause birth defects. Scientists still don’t entirely understand what happened, or what they missed. But there are things we do know for sure about how climate affects some diseases: Malaria, for instance, thrives in hotter regions not just because the mosquitoes that carry it do, too, but because for every degree increase in temperature, the parasite reproduces ten times faster. Which is one reason that the World Bank estimates that by 2050, 5.2 billion people will be reckoning with it.  V. Unbreathable Air  A rolling death smog that suffocates millions.  By the end of the century, the coolest months in tropical South America, Africa, and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century. Photo: Heartless Machine  Our lungs need oxygen, but that is only a fraction of what we breathe. The fraction of carbon dioxide is growing: It just crossed 400 parts per million, and high-end estimates extrapolating from current trends suggest it will hit 1,000 ppm by 2100. At that concentration, compared to the air we breathe now, human cognitive ability declines by 21 percent.  Other stuff in the hotter air is even scarier, with small increases in pollution capable of shortening life spans by ten years. The warmer the planet gets, the more ozone forms, and by mid-century, Americans will likely suffer a 70 percent increase in unhealthy ozone smog, the National Center for Atmospheric Research has projected. By 2090, as many as 2 billion people globally will be breathing air above the WHO “safe” level; one paper last month showed that, among other effects, a pregnant mother’s exposure to ozone raises the child’s risk of autism (as much as tenfold, combined with other environmental factors). Which does make you think again about the autism epidemic in West Hollywood.  Already, more than 10,000 people die each day from the small particles emitted from fossil-fuel burning; each year, 339,000 people die from wildfire smoke, in part because climate change has extended forest-fire season (in the U.S., it’s increased by 78 days since 1970). By 2050, according to the U.S. Forest Service, wildfires will be twice as destructive as they are today; in some places, the area burned could grow fivefold. What worries people even more is the effect that would have on emissions, especially when the fires ravage forests arising out of peat. Peatland fires in Indonesia in 1997, for instance, added to the global CO2 release by up to 40 percent, and more burning only means more warming only means more burning. There is also the terrifying possibility that rain forests like the Amazon, which in 2010 suffered its second “hundred-year drought” in the space of five years, could dry out enough to become vulnerable to these kinds of devastating, rolling forest fires — which would not only expel enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere but also shrink the size of the forest. That is especially bad because the Amazon alone provides 20 percent of our oxygen.  Then there are the more familiar forms of pollution. In 2013, melting Arctic ice remodeled Asian weather patterns, depriving industrial China of the natural ventilation systems it had come to depend on, which blanketed much of the country’s north in an unbreathable smog. Literally unbreathable. A metric called the Air Quality Index categorizes the risks and tops out at the 301-to-500 range, warning of “serious aggravation of heart or lung disease and premature mortality in persons with cardiopulmonary disease and the elderly” and, for all others, “serious risk of respiratory effects”; at that level, “everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion.” The Chinese “airpocalypse” of 2013 peaked at what would have been an Air Quality Index of over 800. That year, smog was responsible for a third of all deaths in the country.  VI. Perpetual War  The violence baked into heat.  Climatologists are very careful when talking about Syria. They want you to know that while climate change did produce a drought that contributed to civil war, it is not exactly fair to saythat the conflict is the result of warming; next door, for instance, Lebanon suffered the same crop failures. But researchers like Marshall Burke and Solomon Hsiang have managed to quantify some of the non-obvious relationships between temperature and violence: For every half-degree of warming, they say, societies will see between a 10 and 20 percent increase in the likelihood of armed conflict. In climate science, nothing is simple, but the arithmetic is harrowing: A planet five degrees warmer would have at least half again as many wars as we do today. Overall, social conflict could more than double this century.  This is one reason that, as nearly every climate scientist I spoke to pointed out, the U.S. military is obsessed with climate change: The drowning of all American Navy bases by sea-level rise is trouble enough, but being the world’s policeman is quite a bit harder when the crime rate doubles. Of course, it’s not just Syria where climate has contributed to conflict. Some speculate that the elevated level of strife across the Middle East over the past generation reflects the pressures of global warming — a hypothesis all the more cruel considering that warming began accelerating when the industrialized world extracted and then burned the region’s oil.  What accounts for the relationship between climate and conflict? Some of it comes down to agriculture and economics; a lot has to do with forced migration, already at a record high, with at least 65 million displaced people wandering the planet right now. But there is also the simple fact of individual irritability. Heat increases municipal crime rates, and swearing on social media, and the likelihood that a major-league pitcher, coming to the mound after his teammate has been hit by a pitch, will hit an opposing batter in retaliation. And the arrival of air-conditioning in the developed world, in the middle of the past century, did little to solve the problem of the summer crime wave.  VII. Permanent Economic Collapse  Dismal capitalism in a half-poorer world.  The murmuring mantra of global neoliberalism, which prevailed between the end of the Cold War and the onset of the Great Recession, is that economic growth would save us from anything and everything.  But in the aftermath of the 2008 crash, a growing number of historians studying what they call “fossil capitalism” have begun to suggest that the entire history of swift economic growth, which began somewhat suddenly in the 18th century, is not the result of innovation or trade or the dynamics of global capitalism but simply our discovery of fossil fuels and all their raw power — a onetime injection of new “value” into a system that had previously been characterized by global subsistence living. Before fossil fuels, nobody lived better than their parents or grandparents or ancestors from 500 years before, except in the immediate aftermath of a great plague like the Black Death, which allowed the lucky survivors to gobble up the resources liberated by mass graves. After we’ve burned all the fossil fuels, these scholars suggest, perhaps we will return to a “steady state” global economy. Of course, that onetime injection has a devastating long-term cost: climate change.  The most exciting research on the economics of warming has also come from Hsiang and his colleagues, who are not historians of fossil capitalism but who offer some very bleak analysis of their own: Every degree Celsius of warming costs, on average, 1.2 percent of GDP (an enormous number, considering we count growth in the low single digits as “strong”). This is the sterling work in the field, and their median projection is for a 23 percent loss in per capita earning globally by the end of this century (resulting from changes in agriculture, crime, storms, energy, mortality, and labor).  Tracing the shape of the probability curve is even scarier: There is a 12 percent chance that climate change will reduce global output by more than 50 percent by 2100, they say, and a 51 percent chance that it lowers per capita GDP by 20 percent or more by then, unless emissions decline. By comparison, the Great Recession lowered global GDP by about 6 percent, in a onetime shock; Hsiang and his colleagues estimate a one-in-eight chance of an ongoing and irreversible effect by the end of the century that is eight times worse.  The scale of that economic devastation is hard to comprehend, but you can start by imagining what the world would look like today with an economy half as big, which would produce only half as much value, generating only half as much to offer the workers of the world. It makes the grounding of flights out of heat-stricken Phoenix last month seem like pathetically small economic potatoes. And, among other things, it makes the idea of postponing government action on reducing emissions and relying solely on growth and technology to solve the problem an absurd business calculation.  Every round-trip ticket on flights from New York to London, keep in mind, costs the Arctic three more square meters of ice.  VIII. Poisoned Oceans  Sulfide burps off the skeleton coast.  That the sea will become a killer is a given. Barring a radical reduction of emissions, we will see at least four feet of sea-level rise and possibly ten by the end of the century. A third of the world’s major cities are on the coast, not to mention its power plants, ports, navy bases, farmlands, fisheries, river deltas, marshlands, and rice-paddy empires, and even those above ten feet will flood much more easily, and much more regularly, if the water gets that high. At least 600 million people live within ten meters of sea level today.  But the drowning of those homelands is just the start. At present, more than a third of the world’s carbon is sucked up by the oceans — thank God, or else we’d have that much more warming already. But the result is what’s called “ocean acidification,” which, on its own, may add a half a degree to warming this century. It is also already burning through the planet’s water basins — you may remember these as the place where life arose in the first place. You have probably heard of “coral bleaching” — that is, coral dying — which is very bad news, because reefs support as much as a quarter of all marine life and supply food for half a billion people. Ocean acidification will fry fish populations directly, too, though scientists aren’t yet sure how to predict the effects on the stuff we haul out of the ocean to eat; they do know that in acid waters, oysters and mussels will struggle to grow their shells, and that when the pH of human blood drops as much as the oceans’ pH has over the past generation, it induces seizures, comas, and sudden death.  That isn’t all that ocean acidification can do. Carbon absorption can initiate a feedback loop in which underoxygenated waters breed different kinds of microbes that turn the water still more “anoxic,” first in deep ocean “dead zones,” then gradually up toward the surface. There, the small fish die out, unable to breathe, which means oxygen-eating bacteria thrive, and the feedback loop doubles back. This process, in which dead zones grow like cancers, choking off marine life and wiping out fisheries, is already quite advanced in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and just off Namibia, where hydrogen sulfide is bubbling out of the sea along a thousand-mile stretch of land known as the “Skeleton Coast.” The name originally referred to the detritus of the whaling industry, but today it’s more apt than ever. Hydrogen sulfide is so toxic that evolution has trained us to recognize the tiniest, safest traces of it, which is why our noses are so exquisitely skilled at registering flatulence. Hydrogen sulfide is also the thing that finally did us in that time 97 percent of all life on Earth died, once all the feedback loops had been triggered and the circulating jet streams of a warmed ocean ground to a halt — it’s the planet’s preferred gas for a natural holocaust. Gradually, the ocean’s dead zones spread, killing off marine species that had dominated the oceans for hundreds of millions of years, and the gas the inert waters gave off into the atmosphere poisoned everything on land. Plants, too. It was millions of years before the oceans recovered.  IX. The Great Filter  Our present eeriness cannot last.  So why can’t we see it? In his recent book-length essay The Great Derangement, the Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh wonders why global warming and natural disaster haven’t become major subjects of contemporary fiction — why we don’t seem able to imagine climate catastrophe, and why we haven’t yet had a spate of novels in the genre he basically imagines into half-existence and names “the environmental uncanny.” “Consider, for example, the stories that congeal around questions like, ‘Where were you when the Berlin Wall fell?’ or ‘Where were you on 9/11?’ ” he writes. “Will it ever be possible to ask, in the same vein, ‘Where were you at 400 ppm?’ or ‘Where were you when the Larsen B ice shelf broke up?’ ” His answer: Probably not, because the dilemmas and dramas of climate change are simply incompatible with the kinds of stories we tell ourselves about ourselves, especially in novels, which tend to emphasize the journey of an individual conscience rather than the poisonous miasma of social fate.  Surely this blindness will not last — the world we are about to inhabit will not permit it. In a six-degree-warmer world, the Earth’s ecosystem will boil with so many natural disasters that we will just start calling them “weather”: a constant swarm of out-of-control typhoons and tornadoes and floods and droughts, the planet assaulted regularly with climate events that not so long ago destroyed whole civilizations. The strongest hurricanes will come more often, and we’ll have to invent new categories with which to describe them; tornadoes will grow longer and wider and strike much more frequently, and hail rocks will quadruple in size. Humans used to watch the weather to prophesy the future; going forward, we will see in its wrath the vengeance of the past. Early naturalists talked often about “deep time” — the perception they had, contemplating the grandeur of this valley or that rock basin, of the profound slowness of nature. What lies in store for us is more like what the Victorian anthropologists identified as “dreamtime,” or “everywhen”: the semi-mythical experience, described by Aboriginal Australians, of encountering, in the present moment, an out-of-time past, when ancestors, heroes, and demigods crowded an epic stage. You can find it already watching footage of an iceberg collapsing into the sea — a feeling of history happening all at once.  It is. Many people perceive climate change as a sort of moral and economic debt, accumulated since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and now come due after several centuries — a helpful perspective, in a way, since it is the carbon-burning processes that began in 18th-century England that lit the fuse of everything that followed. But more than half of the carbon humanity has exhaled into the atmosphere in its entire history has been emitted in just the past three decades; since the end of World War II, the figure is 85 percent. Which means that, in the length of a single generation, global warming has brought us to the brink of planetary catastrophe, and that the story of the industrial world’s kamikaze mission is also the story of a single lifetime. My father’s, for instance: born in 1938, among his first memories the news of Pearl Harbor and the mythic Air Force of the propaganda films that followed, films that doubled as advertisements for imperial-American industrial might; and among his last memories the coverage of the desperate signing of the Paris climate accords on cable news, ten weeks before he died of lung cancer last July. Or my mother’s: born in 1945, to German Jews fleeing the smokestacks through which their relatives were incinerated, now enjoying her 72nd year in an American commodity paradise, a paradise supported by the supply chains of an industrialized developing world. She has been smoking for 57 of those years, unfiltered.  Or the scientists’. Some of the men who first identified a changing climate (and given the generation, those who became famous were men) are still alive; a few are even still working. Wally Broecker is 84 years old and drives to work at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory across the Hudson every day from the Upper West Side. Like most of those who first raised the alarm, he believes that no amount of emissions reduction alone can meaningfully help avoid disaster. Instead, he puts his faith in carbon capture — untested technology to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which Broecker estimates will cost at least several trillion dollars — and various forms of “geoengineering,” the catchall name for a variety of moon-shot technologies far-fetched enough that many climate scientists prefer to regard them as dreams, or nightmares, from science fiction. He is especially focused on what’s called the aerosol approach — dispersing so much sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere that when it converts to sulfuric acid, it will cloud a fifth of the horizon and reflect back 2 percent of the sun’s rays, buying the planet at least a little wiggle room, heat-wise. “Of course, that would make our sunsets very red, would bleach the sky, would make more acid rain,” he says. “But you have to look at the magnitude of the problem. You got to watch that you don’t say the giant problem shouldn’t be solved because the solution causes some smaller problems.” He won’t be around to see that, he told me. “But in your lifetime …”  Jim Hansen is another member of this godfather generation. Born in 1941, he became a climatologist at the University of Iowa, developed the groundbreaking “Zero Model” for projecting climate change, and later became the head of climate research at NASA, only to leave under pressure when, while still a federal employee, he filed a lawsuit against the federal government charging inaction on warming (along the way he got arrested a few times for protesting, too). The lawsuit, which is brought by a collective called Our Children’s Trust and is often described as “kids versus climate change,” is built on an appeal to the equal-protection clause, namely, that in failing to take action on warming, the government is violating it by imposing massive costs on future generations; it is scheduled to be heard this winter in Oregon district court. Hansen has recently given up on solving the climate problem with a carbon tax alone, which had been his preferred approach, and has set about calculating the total cost of the additional measure of extracting carbon from the atmosphere.  Hansen began his career studying Venus, which was once a very Earth-like planet with plenty of life-supporting water before runaway climate change rapidly transformed it into an arid and uninhabitable sphere enveloped in an unbreathable gas; he switched to studying our planet by 30, wondering why he should be squinting across the solar system to explore rapid environmental change when he could see it all around him on the planet he was standing on. “When we wrote our first paper on this, in 1981,” he told me, “I remember saying to one of my co-authors, ‘This is going to be very interesting. Sometime during our careers, we’re going to see these things beginning to happen.’ ”  Several of the scientists I spoke with proposed global warming as the solution to Fermi’s famous paradox, which asks, If the universe is so big, then why haven’t we encountered any other intelligent life in it? The answer, they suggested, is that the natural life span of a civilization may be only several thousand years, and the life span of an industrial civilization perhaps only several hundred. In a universe that is many billions of years old, with star systems separated as much by time as by space, civilizations might emerge and develop and burn themselves up simply too fast to ever find one another. Peter Ward, a charismatic paleontologist among those responsible for discovering that the planet’s mass extinctions were caused by greenhouse gas, calls this the “Great Filter”: “Civilizations rise, but there’s an environmental filter that causes them to die off again and disappear fairly quickly,” he told me. “If you look at planet Earth, the filtering we’ve had in the past has been in these mass extinctions.” The mass extinction we are now living through has only just begun; so much more dying is coming.  And yet, improbably, Ward is an optimist. So are Broecker and Hansen and many of the other scientists I spoke to. We have not developed much of a religion of meaning around climate change that might comfort us, or give us purpose, in the face of possible annihilation. But climate scientists have a strange kind of faith: We will find a way to forestall radical warming, they say, because we must.  It is not easy to know how much to be reassured by that bleak certainty, and how much to wonder whether it is another form of delusion; for global warming to work as parable, of course, someone needs to survive to tell the story. The scientists know that to even meet the Paris goals, by 2050, carbon emissions from energy and industry, which are still rising, will have to fall by half each decade; emissions from land use (deforestation, cow farts, etc.) will have to zero out; and we will need to have invented technologies to extract, annually, twice as much carbon from the atmosphere as the entire planet’s plants now do. Nevertheless, by and large, the scientists have an enormous confidence in the ingenuity of humans — a confidence perhaps bolstered by their appreciation for climate change, which is, after all, a human invention, too. They point to the Apollo project, the hole in the ozone we patched in the 1980s, the passing of the fear of mutually assured destruction. Now we’ve found a way to engineer our own doomsday, and surely we will find a way to engineer our way out of it, one way or another. The planet is not used to being provoked like this, and climate systems designed to give feedback over centuries or millennia prevent us — even those who may be watching closely — from fully imagining the damage done already to the planet. But when we do truly see the world we’ve made, they say, we will also find a way to make it livable. For them, the alternative is simply unimaginable.  *This article appears in the July 10, 2017, issue of New York Magazine.  *This article has been updated to provide context for the recent news reports about revisions to a satellite data set, to more accurately reflect the rate of warming during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, to clarify a reference to Peter Brannen’s The Ends of the World, and to make clear that James Hansen still supports a carbon-tax based approach to emissions.

Much, Much Sooner Than You Imagine.	partially false
2478493a	In the Atlantic Ocean, Subtle Shifts Hint at Dramatic Dangers The warming atmosphere is causing an arm of the powerful Gulf Stream to weaken, some scientists fear.

The fear: Melting Greenland ice will tip the delicate balance of hot and cold that defines not only the North Atlantic, but life far and wide. The New York Times.  It’s one of the mightiest rivers you will never see, carrying some 30 times more water than all the world’s freshwater rivers combined. In the North Atlantic, one arm of the Gulf Stream breaks toward Iceland, transporting vast amounts of warmth far northward, by one estimate supplying Scandinavia with heat equivalent to 78,000 times its current energy use. Without this current — a heat pump on a planetary scale — scientists believe that great swaths of the world might look quite different.  Now, a spate of studies, including one published last week, suggests this northern portion of the Gulf Stream and the deep ocean currents it’s connected to may be slowing. Pushing the bounds of oceanography, scientists have slung necklace-like sensor arrays across the Atlantic to better understand the complex network of currents that the Gulf Stream belongs to, not only at the surface, but hundreds of feet deep.  “We’re all wishing it’s not true,” Peter de Menocal, a paleoceanographer and president and director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said of the changing ocean currents. “Because if that happens, it’s just a monstrous change.”  The consequences could include faster sea level rise along parts of the Eastern United States and parts of Europe, stronger hurricanes barreling into the Southeastern United States, and perhaps most ominously, reduced rainfall across the Sahel, a semi-arid swath of land running the width of Africa that is already a geopolitical tinderbox.  The scientists’ concern stems from their understanding of thousands of years of the prehistoric climate record. In the past, a great weakening or even shutdown of this arm of the Gulf Stream seems to have triggered rapid changes in temperatures and precipitation patterns around the North Atlantic and beyond.  The northern arm of the Gulf Stream is but one tentacle of a larger, ocean-spanning tangle of currents called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC. Scientists have strong evidence from ice and sediment cores that the AMOC has weakened and shut down before in the past 13,000 years. As a result, mean temperatures in parts of Europe may have rapidly dropped to about 15 degrees Celsius below today’s averages, ushering in arctic like conditions. Parts of northern Africa and northern South America became much drier. Rainfall may even have declined as far away as what is now China. And some of these changes may have occurred in a matter of decades, maybe less.  The AMOC is thus a poster child for the idea of climatic “tipping points” — of hard-to-predict thresholds in Earth’s climate system that, once crossed, have rapid, cascading effects far beyond the corner of the globe where they occur. “It’s a switch,” said Dr. de Menocal, and one that can be thrown quickly.  Which brings us to the cold blob. Almost everywhere around the world, average temperatures are rising — except southeast of Greenland where a large patch of the North Atlantic has become colder in recent years.  Deep beneath the surface, scientists are searching for changes in the currents. Deep beneath the surface, scientists are searching for changes in the currents.

In short, the cold blob may signal that the northern arm of the Gulf Stream no longer arrives with the same strength to the North Atlantic. That a warming atmosphere has, paradoxically, cooled one part of the world.  The science remains relatively new, and not everyone agrees the AMOC is actually slowing. But in both scientific modeling of climate change and in the prehistoric record, a North Atlantic cooling presages a shutdown of the current. “One of the hallmarks of a shutdown is this cold blob,” says Dr. de Menocal. “The cold blob is a big deal.”  In 1513, the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León noticed something bizarre off the coast of today’s Florida: Relentless currents pushing his ships backward, overpowering the winds blowing them forward. He became the first European to describe the Gulf Stream. Benjamin Franklin finally mapped it in the late 1700s — he named it the “Gulf Stream” — by measuring changes in water temperature on a return trip from England.  Over the 20th century, oceanographers came to realize that the northern branch of the Gulf Stream was part of a gigantic loop of water, with warm surface water flowing north and colder water returning south, deep below the surface. This was the network of currents that scientists now call the AMOC.  The system was driven by North Atlantic water that, as it lost heat to the atmosphere and grew dense, sank to the ocean’s depths, pulling warmer surface water northward. In the middle part of the century, oceanographer Henry Stommel elucidated the physics of how the AMOC could change. His insight was that, depending on the balance of heat and salinity, the sinking effect—called “overturning”—could strengthen, or weaken, or maybe stop completely.  In the 1980s, Wallace Broecker, a geochemist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, pounced on that idea.  Colleagues studying ice cores from the Greenland ice sheet were seeing evidence of strange climatic “flickers” in the past. As Earth warmed from the deep freeze of the last ice age, which peaked around 22,000 years ago, temperatures would rise, then abruptly fall, then rise again just as swiftly. Dr. Broecker theorized this was caused by stops and starts in what he called the ocean’s “great conveyor belt” — the AMOC.  The clearest example began about 12,800 years ago. Glaciers that had once covered much of North America and Europe had retreated considerably, and the world was almost out of the deep freeze. But then, in just a few decades, Greenland and Western Europe plunged back into cold. Temperatures fell by around 10 degrees Celsius, or 18 degrees Fahrenheit, in parts of Greenland. Arctic-like conditions returned to parts of Europe.  The cold snap lasted perhaps 1,300 years — before reversing even more abruptly than it began. Scientists have observed the sudden changes in the pollen deposited at the bottom of European lakes and in changes in ocean sediments near Bermuda.  This forced a paradigm shift in how scientists thought about climate change. Earlier, they had tended to imagine creeping shifts occurring over many millennia. But by the late 1990s, they accepted that abrupt transitions, tipping points, could occur.  This didn’t bode well for humanity’s warming of the atmosphere. Dr. Broecker, who died in 2019, famously warned: “The climate system is an angry beast and we are poking it with sticks.”  Why did the AMOC shut down? A leading theory is that meltwater from retreating glaciers emptied into the North Atlantic or Arctic oceans. Freshwater is lighter than saltwater, and the sudden influx of more buoyant water could have impeded the sinking of denser, saltier water — that critical “overturning” phase of the AMOC.  Today we don’t have massive glacial lakes threatening to disgorge into the North Atlantic. But we do have the Greenland ice sheet, which is melting at the upper end of projections, or about six times faster than in the 1990s. And according to one study, the subpolar North Atlantic recently became less salty than at any time in the past 120 years.  There’s little agreement on cause. Changes in wind patterns or currents may be contributing, as could greater rainfall. But Stefan Rahmstorf, a physical oceanographer with the University of Potsdam in Germany, suspects that, similar to what happened some 12,800 years ago, meltwater from Greenland is beginning to slow the AMOC.  In 2014, a remarkable project launched in the North Atlantic. An array of sophisticated sensors were moored to the ocean floor between Newfoundland, Greenland and Scotland. They’re starting to provide an unprecedented view of the currents that shape the Atlantic.  Here off Labrador, we can see how waters move deep beneath the surface.

In 2015, Dr. Rahmstorf and his colleagues published a seminal paper arguing that the AMOC had weakened by 15 percent in recent decades, a slowdown they said was unprecedented in the past 1,000 years. He and his colleagues recently published another paper that used additional reconstructions of sea temperature around the North Atlantic, some going back 1,600 years, to determine that the recent slowdown began with the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, then accelerated after 1950.  Other scientists have also presented different evidence of a slowdown. The South Atlantic has become saltier in recent decades, according to a study by Chenyu Zhu at Ocean University of China and Zhengyu Liu at Nanjing Normal University, suggesting that more of the salt that once traveled north with the AMOC now remains in the tropics, producing what they call a “salinity pile-up.”  And Christopher Piecuch of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution recently argued that the Gulf Stream along Florida’s coast, also called the Florida current, has weakened. He found this by measuring the differences in sea level across the Gulf Stream. Earth’s rotation deflects flowing water to the right; this causes the two sides of the current to have slightly different sea levels — and the faster the current, the greater the difference. Tide gauge measurements going back 110 years indicate that this contrast has declined, Dr. Piecuch found, particularly in the past two decades. This suggests the current has slowed.  For Dr. Rahmstorf, these lines of evidence bolster the argument that the AMOC is slowing. In his view, the change is occurring right on schedule. “The long-term trend is exactly what was predicted by the models,” he said.  A 2019 report by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a synthesis of the most significant climate research worldwide, says that while the AMOC will “very likely” weaken later this century, collapse is “very unlikely.” Yet Dr. Rahmstorf worries about the unknowns in a system that scientists understand can rapidly shift between different states.  He points out that, in IPCC jargon, “very unlikely” translates to a probability of less than 10 percent. But if a nuclear reactor in your neighborhood had a less-than-10-percent likelihood of blowing up, he asked, “would you be reassured?”  “We still don’t know how far away this threshold is where it could break down altogether,” he said. If we limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times — a goal of the Paris agreement among nations to fight climate change — a shutdown is unlikely, he thinks. “But for unmitigated warming,” which is the world’s current trajectory, “I think there’s increasing risk where we make AMOC so weak it goes over the edge and collapses.”  “There will be a lot of surprises if we disturb climate that much,” he said. “It’s not at all predictable how bad things will be.”  Scientists also emphasize that the ultimate consequences of that weakening remain unclear. That’s in part because the world is in such uncharted territory. In the past, Europe became drastically cooler when the current shut down, but today any cooling might ultimately be muted or possibly canceled out by continued global heating.  But if past is prologue, a drastically altered AMOC could certainly shift rainfall patterns, scientists said, making parts of Europe and Northern Africa drier, and areas in the Southern hemisphere wetter. Changing ocean currents might affect marine ecosystems that people rely on for food and livelihood.  A changing Gulf Stream could also accelerate sea-level rise along parts of the Atlantic coast of the United States. In 2009 and 2010, when the stream inexplicably weakened by 30 percent, the Northeast saw seas rise at a rate unprecedented in the entire roughly 100-year record of tide gauges.  And if water in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic becomes warmer because that heat is no longer shunted north, the expanding reservoir of energy could strengthen hurricanes, something that scientists at the National Oceanography Centre in the United Kingdom argue is already happening. Hurricanes derive their energy from heat in the water.  Finally, in a perverse twist, a shutdown of the AMOC could exacerbate global heating. The ocean absorbs nearly one-third of human carbon dioxide emissions. But the sinking of salty, dense water — the overturning portion of the AMOC — is critical to that absorption. So, if the AMOC stops or greatly slows, and that water stops sinking, the accumulation of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere could accelerate.  Then there are those consequences that fall in the category of “global weirding.”  Scientists at the U.K.’s National Oceanography Centre have somewhat counterintuitively linked the cold blob in the North Atlantic with summer heat waves in Europe. In 2015 and 2018, the jet stream, a river of wind that moves from west to east over temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere, made an unusual detour to the south around the cold blob. The wrinkle in atmospheric flow brought hotter-than-usual air into Europe, they contend, breaking temperature records.  The New York Times.  “That was not predicted,” said Joel Hirschi, principal scientist at the centre and senior author of the research. It highlights how current seasonal forecasting models are unable to predict these warm summers. And it underscores the paradox that, far from ushering in a frigid future for, say, Paris, a cooler North Atlantic might actually make France’s summers more like Morocco’s.  Even so, Dr. Hirschi takes a wait-and-see stance on whether the AMOC is actually slowing. “I have great respect for what Dr. Rahmstorf is doing. And it may well be spot on in the end,” he says. “But I’m afraid the data, the really robust data, is not there.”  Susan Lozier, a physical oceanographer and dean at the College of Sciences at Georgia Tech, also has her doubts about whether the AMOC is currently slowing. At issue, she says, is how scientists infer changes in the AMOC. We can directly measure many aspects of the ocean, such as temperature (it’s warming), oxygen levels (they’re declining), even how stratified it has become (more so). “There are very strong signals in the ocean of climate change,” she said.  But most studies on the AMOC don’t measure the “conveyor belt” directly. Instead, they use proxies to infer that the overturning has changed.  Such inference can be problematic when considering changes that occur over short time frames, says Dr. Lozier, because the changes observed could have other causes. Consider that cold blob in the North Atlantic, she said. Dr. Rahmstorf and others see it as evidence of a weakening Gulf Stream, but Dr. Lozier notes that shifts in wind patterns or how storms move over the ocean could also underlie the phenomenon. “There are other ways to explain it,” she said. “A lot of our conceptual understanding of AMOC is in isolation of other things going on in the ocean.”  Direct measurement of the AMOC only began relatively recently. A line of sensors between the Bahamas and the Canary Islands, called Rapid, was installed in 2004. A second sensor array, spanning the North Atlantic from Canada to Greenland to Scotland and called Osnap, went live in 2014. (Dr. Lozier is the international project lead for Osnap.)  Neither project has operated long enough to produce clear trends, in Dr. Lozier’s view. What they have shown, though, is lots of natural variability. In 2009 and 2010, for example, the AMOC weakened — “people were like, ‘Oh my God, this is happening,’” she said — only to pick right back up again over the following years.  They’ve also revealed a system of currents that’s far more complex than once envisioned.  Dr. Broecker’s old schematics of the AMOC posit a neat warm current flowing north along the western edge of the Atlantic and an equally neat cold current flowing back south below it. In fact, says Dr. Lozier, that deeper current is not confined to the western edge of the Atlantic, but rather flows southward via a number of “rivers” that are filled with eddies. The network of deep ocean currents is much more complicated than once envisioned, in other words, and figuring out how buoyant meltwater from Greenland might affect the formation of cold deepwater has become more complicated as well.  This is the place scientists currently find themselves in. They suspect the AMOC can work like a climate switch. They’re watching it closely. Some argue that it’s already changing, others that it’s too soon to tell.  “There’s no consensus on whether it has slowed to date, or if it’s currently slowing,” said Dr. Lozier. “But there is a consensus that if we continue to warm the atmosphere, it will slow.”	In the Atlantic Ocean, Subtle Shifts Hint at Dramatic Dangers	partially false
a910fe22	"Over the past year, scientists have been keeping a close eye on an important swath of the Pacific Ocean, just along the equator. When conditions here get just right, an El Niño can form — wreaking havoc on weather patterns across the globe.  The El Niño currently brewing in the Pacific is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever recorded. This phenomenon is expected to peak before January, with far-reaching impacts all winter and spring. Based on past experience, El Niño could potentially bring much-needed rain to California, but also drought in Australia, destructive floods in Peru, and so on. El Niño has already helped make 2015 the hottest year on record — and might well do the same for 2016.  That said, El Niño events are often unpredictable and full of surprises. So what follows is a guide to how El Niño works, what we know about the 2015 event, and how a potentially massive El Niño could upend the world's weather over the coming months.  A very basic definition of El Niño  El Niño is a weather phenomenon that occurs irregularly in the eastern tropical Pacific every two to seven years. When the trade winds that usually blow from east to west weaken, sea surface temperatures start rising, setting off a chain of atmospheric impacts.  El Niños can be strong or weak. Strong events can temporarily disrupt weather patterns around the world, typically making certain regions wetter (Peru or California, say) and others drier (Southeast Asia). Some countries suffer major damage as a result.  El Niños also transfer heat stored in the deeper layers of the ocean to the surface. When combined with global warming, that can lead to record hot years, as in 1998.  ""El Niño"" got its name in the 1800s from Peruvian fisherman, who first noticed a mysterious warm current that would appear around Christmas. They called it the ""little boy"" or ""Christ child.""  Why this year's El Niño is a huge deal  The last truly massive El Niño appeared in 1997-'98 and ended up causing an estimated $35 billion in destruction and 23,000 deaths around the world. (It also inspired that famous Chris Farley sketch.) Now we're facing a similarly massive event:  That, in itself, is a surprise. Back in March, NOAA's Climate Prediction Center announced that a weak El Niño had formed in the Pacific, but many experts initially thought it might fizzle out by summer. Instead, this El Niño kept strengthening, with ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific continuing to soar. By mid-November, temperatures in one critical part of the ocean, the Niño 3.4 region, were running even hotter than they were in 1997:  ""Right now we say we think it's really going to be one of the three strongest ones,"" said Michel Jarraud, the secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization, who compared it with the 1997-98, 1982-83, and 1972-73 El Niño events. ""It may be one of the two; that we don't know yet. But definitely it's already a very strong one.""  Countries across the globe will have to brace themselves as this event peaks this winter and lasts through the spring. El Niño has already triggered longer droughts in Indonesia, enabling massive man-made peatland fires to rage out of control, creating toxic haze that has spread as far as Singapore. Warmer ocean temperatures have also caused a major coral bleaching event, harming reefs around the world.  And El Niño may just be getting started: In the past, major events have brought unusually hot, dry weather to Australia that can cramp wheat yields and amp up wildfires. It can bring hotter, drier weather to India that hurts agriculture. It can bring heavy rain and destructive flooding to Peru, washing away houses and spreading cholera.  That said, El Niño isn't all bad. In the United States, it could bring some needed rain this winter to ease California's drought (though also deadly mudslides and flooding). Historically, El Niño has also served up milder US winters and tamped down on Atlantic hurricanes.  One important caveat, however, is that every El Niño unfolds a bit differently — and some have unexpected impacts. As NOAA's Emily Becker points out, strong El Niño events usually bring rain to California in the winter (as in 1982-'83), but occasionally they don't (as in 1965-'66):  Another key story to watch is how a strong El Niño might push up temperatures worldwide. Global average temperatures are already going up over time, thanks to all the carbon dioxide we're adding to the atmosphere. According to NASA, 2014 was the hottest year on record. But there was no El Niño that year — and El Niño years tend to be a bit hotter than average, as heat gets transferred from the ocean to the surface.  The combination of El Niño and rising CO2 is already helping 2015 shatter heat records. The big question now is whether it'll do the same for 2016:  Bottom line: There are still a lot of question marks about how this will unfold. But El Niño could well be the biggest weather story of the next several months, with ripple effects around the globe.  How El Niño actually works, step by step  To see how El Niño works, it helps to understand what the equatorial Pacific looks like under normal, or ""neutral,"" conditions:  1) Neutral conditions in the equatorial Pacific Ocean  Normally, the tropical Pacific features strong trade winds that blow warm ocean water from east to west, where it piles up near Indonesia. Meanwhile, back east along South America, frigid water deep down in the ocean gets pulled up closer to the surface, cooling the area around Peru. Here's a diagram:  As a result, during ""neutral"" conditions, sea levels are about half a meter higher near Indonesia than they are in Peru. And the surface water near Indonesia is about 8°C warmer (14.4°F) than it is near Peru. That temperature difference creates a convective loop in the atmosphere that, in turn, reinforces the trade winds.  This ends up affecting a lot more than just this stretch of ocean. Because the Pacific is so vast, this system is a major driving force in the global climate. The large, warm pool of water near Indonesia causes the air above it to rise, creating rainfall in the region. And this system shapes the jet streams that guide weather and storms around the world.  That's how it works under normal conditions, anyway. But things look a little different when El Niño comes along.  2) Now along comes El Niño  Every few years, those prevailing Pacific trade winds that blow east to west can weaken. (Scientists are still debating the nuances of exactly why this happens.)  When the trade winds weaken, all that warm water that was piled up near Indonesia starts sloshing back eastward, pulled back down by gravity. What's more, the underwater layer known as the thermocline starts sinking. As a result, there's less cold water rising up from the deep ocean near South America — so the waters near Peru start warming up. Here's another diagram:  This causes sea surface temperatures in the east and central Pacific to start rising and the trade winds to weaken even further. What's more, rainfall starts following that warm pool of water as it travels eastward. That's why El Niño is usually associated with drier weather in places like Indonesia and Australia, as well as heavier rains in places like Peru (or California). The rain is essentially moving east.  Scientists officially declare an El Niño when sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean (known as the Niño 3.4 region) rise 0.5°C above their historical baseline for three months in a row — and once atmospheric conditions and rainfall patterns shift accordingly.  Again, because the Pacific is so vast, an El Niño can have large ripple effects on weather around the world, especially during the winter months. Here's a look at the changes that have historically accompanied El Niño events:  Typical effects of an El Niño during the winter:  A strong El Niño can weaken monsoons in the Indian Ocean, for example. It can also cause the jet stream to start stretching from the Eastern Pacific across the southern United States, bringing rainfall and storms with it. Still, a lot depends on how strong the El Niño actually is — and occasionally there are aberrations and exceptions to the rule. More on that below.  El Niño's return in 2015 — and why scientists have been talking about a ""Godzilla"" event  Ever since early 2014, scientists have been expecting this latest El Niño to form. But, in a sign of how slippery the system can be, El Niño kept defying predictions and not showing up.  Finally, in March 2015, after several false starts, scientists at NOAA's climate prediction center were ready to declare that a weak El Niño was underway. Specifically, sea surface temperatures in that Niño 3.4 region (roughly in the center of the chart below) had been at least 0.5°C above their baseline since September. And, importantly, atmospheric conditions were responding in turn, with more rain over the central Pacific and less rain over Indonesia:  At the time, however, NOAA's forecasters said that this El Niño looked ""weak,"" with possibly minimal effects on global weather patterns, and only had a 50 to 60 percent chance of lasting through the summer.  Then, somewhat unexpectedly, El Niño kept getting stronger and stronger. And stronger. By October 2015, sea surface temperatures had soared to more than 2°C above baseline in the Niño 3.4 region, and scientists were seeing strong telltale atmospheric changes. Notice how the anomalous warm area has moved east and is much, much warmer than usual:  Forecasters now expect this El Niño to peak between October and January, and when it does, it's likely to rank among the two or three strongest ever record (along with 1997-'98, 1982-'83, and 1972-'73.) Some forecasters have even dubbed this one a potential ""Godzilla.""  We're already started to see some major El Niño impacts around the world. A paucity of rainfall in Indonesia this fall allowed manmade forest and peat fires to rage out of control, choking the region in a thick toxic haze. And the warmer Pacific waters have fostered an unusually active tropical cyclone season, a hallmark of El Niño. On the flip side, however, the event has also fostered more wind shear in the Atlantic that has curtailed hurricane activity there.  El Niño could bring rain to California — but may not end the drought  As noted above, El Niño tends to be associated with changes in weather patterns around the world, especially during the Northern Hemisphere winter. One tantalizing possibility is that a strong El Niño will bring more rain to California, alleviating the state's drought.  But even here, nothing is certain. El Niño only affects US weather indirectly, by altering atmospheric circulation and shifting the North Pacific jet stream. (See here for a lucid explanation by Columbia University's Anthony Barnston.) This is an intricate chain of events, and small kinks at certain points can affect the ultimate outcome.  As such, Becker cautions people to think not in terms of certainties but in terms of probabilities. Here's an example of how El Niño might shift the odds of a wetter-than-average winter for California (she notes that this isn't a prediction, just an illustration):  In other words, thanks to El Niño, California has a greater chance of a wetter winter, but not a 100 percent chance.  What's more, even if rain does come, that may not be enough to completely erase the massive water deficit that California has built up over the past five years. The state likely needs record precipitation to end the drought, and it also needs the right mix of rain (to recharge the reservoirs) and snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains (to melt during the spring and summer).  Also, be warned: Heavy rain after a drought can bring floods and mudslides. Southern California got a possible preview in mid-October, when a short burst of intense rains led to major mudflows that trapped hundreds of cars. So people need to be ready.  El Niño tends to hurt some countries and benefit others  It's not quite right to say that El Niño events are ""bad"" or ""good."" They tend to have different impacts on different regions.  One recent study from the University of Cambridge found that on average, El Niño events hurt economic activity in Australia, Chile, Indonesia, India, Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa. The reasons varied: drought and reduced crop yields in Australia and India, forest fires in Indonesia, less productive fisheries in Peru.  But that study also found that on average, El Niño tended to boost the economies in Argentina, Canada, Mexico, and even the United States, at least in the very short term. Again, many factors were at play: In addition to bringing needed rain to California and Texas, El Niño was associated with less tornado activity in the midwestern United States and fewer hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean.  Here's a table of the estimated economic impacts on a broad selection of countries:  Again, every big El Niño is different and has its own idiosyncrasies. So think of this table as more a rough guide than gospel.  There are also two important twists here. As the WMO's Michel Jarraud stressed in his October news conference, many countries have learned from the past and implemented measures to guard against El Niño's impacts. (Mexico, for instance, was well-prepared for a record-strength Pacific hurricane that hit the state last month.)  Conversely, this El Niño is also playing out in the context of record warm ocean temperatures, so it could have unpredictable impacts. ""Our scientific understanding of El Niño has increased greatly in recent years. However, this event is playing out in uncharted territory,"" said Jarraud. ""This naturally occurring El Niño event and human induced climate change may interact and modify each other in ways which we have never before experienced.""  El Niño is helping make 2015 a record hot year. What about 2016?  Thanks to global warming, the Earth's average surface temperature has been going up over time. But there's a lot of variation from year to year. El Niño years tend to be a bit hotter than average. La Niña years (when those trade winds strengthen rather than weaken) tend to be a bit cooler than average. Like so:  What's going on here? As humans load more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, we're trapping more and more heat on the Earth's surface. But more than 90 percent of that extra heat is absorbed by the oceans. So subtle interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere can make a big difference for surface temperatures.  When conditions in the Pacific are neutral, more of that heat is trapped beneath the ocean surface. When a strong El Niño forms, more of that heat is transferred to the surface. That's why the Earth's average surface temperatures reached new highs in 1998: You had the combination of global warming and an extremely strong El Niño.  What was remarkable about 2014 is that it was likely the hottest year on record even without an El Niño event — a sign that Earth keeps getting warmer overall. Meanwhile, 2015 is basically guaranteed to be even hotter than 2014.  Now throw a monster El Niño into the mix, and we're looking at a potential shattering of records. Back in January, NASA's Gavin Schmidt explained at a press conference that temperatures typically peak about three months after an El Niño event. Given that forecasters expect this current El Niño to last until next spring, it's entirely possible we could see 2016 also set new highs. We'll have to wait and see.

93db83ce	When UN climate negotiators meet for summit talks this month, there will be a new figure on the table: 3C.  Until now, global efforts such as the Paris climate agreement have tried to limit global warming to 2C above pre-industrial levels. However, with latest projections pointing to an increase of 3.2C by 2100, these goals seem to be slipping out of reach.  Global temperature change compared to pre-industrial levels  “[We] still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future,” said Erik Solheim, the UN environment chief, ahead of the upcoming Bonn conference.  One of the biggest resulting threats to cities around the world is sea-level rise, caused by the expansion of water at higher temperatures and melting ice sheets on the north and south poles.    Scientists at the non-profit organisation Climate Central estimate that 275 million people worldwide live in areas that will eventually be flooded at 3C of global warming.  Asian cities will be worst affected  The regional impact of these changes is highly uneven, with four out of five people affected living in Asia.  Although sea levels will not rise instantaneously, the calculated increases will be “locked in” at a temperature rise of 3C, meaning they will be irreversible even if warming eventually slows down.  Osaka, Japan  5.2 million people affected  At the end of a month in which it has been battered by unseasonably late typhoons and relentless rain, Japan is already confronting the threat posed by climate change-induced flooding.  Image modelling shows that swaths of Osaka – the commercial heart of a region whose GDP is almost as big as that of the Netherlands – would disappear beneath the water in a 3C world, threatening the local economy and almost a third of the wider region’s 19 million residents.  Millions of people live in the urban area surrounding Osaka. Sea-level rise will reshape densely and sparsely populated areas.  As a result of global sea-level rise, storm surges and other factors, economists project that coastal flooding could put almost $1tn of Osaka’s assets at risk by the 2070s, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.  “The costs of protecting cities from rising sea levels and storms are also likely to rise - as are the costs of repairing storm damage,” it said. “Decisions we make today could have a profound impact on the security and culture of the people of this ancient city.”  Like much of Japan, Osaka already has a network of seawalls and other coastal defences in place to combat tsunami – although their effectiveness was disputed in the aftermath of the 2011 triple disaster.  Osaka city authorities are investing in other infrastructure to mitigate the effects of flooding, but public education is also vital, according to Toshikazu Nakaaki of the Osaka municipal government’s environment bureau.  “In the past our response was focused on reducing the causes of global warming, but given that climate change is inevitable, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we are now discussing how to respond to the natural disasters that will follow,” Nakaaki said.  “We anticipate that Osaka will be affected by natural disasters caused by climate change, but we have yet to establish exactly what might happen or how much financial damage they would cause.  “It’s not that we expect sea levels to rise at some point in the future – they are already rising.”  Keiko Kanai has long been aware that her home city is susceptible to natural disasters. “I’d heard that historically, tsunamis caused by earthquakes put many parts of Osaka underwater, and I knew that some parts of the world were at risk from rising sea levels,” said Kanai, who teaches at a local university.  “But I didn’t put two and two together. Until now I haven’t given much thought to the idea that Osaka too could be engulfed by rising sea levels.”  Kaori Akazawa, a nursing care consultant, said flooding was a consideration when she was deciding where in Osaka to live.  “When I moved here I talked to my colleagues about the risks,” she said. “That’s why I’ve always rented apartments on the fourth storey or higher.    “It’s worrying, but I’ve never considered moving.”  Justin McCurry in Tokyo  Alexandria, Egypt  3 million people affected  On the Alexandria Corniche, waves slowly lap at a shoreline dotted with plastic chairs and umbrellas from the beachside cafes. Students perch on the steps of the imposing Alexandria library. But the same coastline that draws locals to its scenic vistas is threatening to slowly engulf the historic city as sea levels rise due to global warming.  The IPCC reported that Alexandria’s beaches would be submerged even with a 0.5-metre sea-level rise, while 8 million people would be displaced by flooding in Alexandria and the Nile Delta if no protective measures are taken. A 3C world threatens far greater damage than that.  Yet for many residents, there is little public information to connect the increasingly chaotic weather and floods with climate change. “The vast majority of Alexandrians don’t have access to knowledge, and that’s what worries me. I don’t expect the government to raise awareness of this problem until it’s already happening,” said 22-year-old student Kareem Mohammed.  “Everyone thinks we should act on this problem 50 or 80 years from now,” agreed his friend, Hazem Hassan, a student in marine biology at the nearby Alexandria University.  Officials maintain that protective measures are being taken, but with little fanfare. “Egypt spends 700m EGP [£30m] annually to protect the north coast,” said Dr Magdy Allam, head of the Arab Environmental Experts Union, who was previously part of the Egyptian environment ministry.  Allam cited the Mohammed Ali sea wall built in 1830 as a key protection, as well as the concrete blocks lining the shoreline designed to “detour flood water away from residential neighbourhoods”. But critics say that this is far from enough given the scale of the problem.  “There are studies indicating that our city is one of many coastal human settlements around the world which will be partially submerged by 2070 if nothing is done,” said Ahmed Hassan, of the Save Alexandria Initiative, a group that works to raise awareness of the effects of climate change on the city.  Ruth Michaelson in Alexandria  Rio de Janeiro, Brazil  1.8 million people affected  Residents of Brazil’s postcard city have plenty of reasons to fear global warming – even if they don’t quite know it. According to Climate Central, a temperature rise of 3C would cause flooding of not just Rio’s famous beaches such as Copacabana and its waterfront domestic airport, but also inland areas of the Barra de Tijuca neighbourhood, where last year’s Olympic Games were held.  Barra is built around a network of heavily polluted lagoons that empty into the sea. The prospect of it being underwater alarmed resident Sueli Gonçalves, 46, who runs pensioners’ health projects, as she and her 23-year-old son Yuri Sanchez carried their shopping past the Olympic Park.  “My God. Oh Jesus,” she said, with a nervous laugh. “I will leave here. I will go to the United States. To Canada.”  The family knew about global warming but were unaware of the potential scale of the impact on their upscale neighbourhood of smart condominiums and a shopping mall.  “Nobody takes it seriously. People do not think long term,” Gonçalves said.    Storm surges recently destroyed hundreds of metres of beachfront pavement overlooking the Macumba beach, a popular surfing spot on Rio’s western fringes. Last year, heavy waves in another storm surge felled an elevated, clifftop cycle path between Leblon beach and Barra de Tijuca which had not been built to survive such high seas, killing two people.  Last year, Rio’s city government and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro produced a study entitled Strategy for Adapting to Climate Change.  “The current challenge consists in deepening knowledge and monitoring of oceanic phenomena and the evolution of the sea bed and coast,” a spokeswoman for the city’s secretariat of the environment said in an email. An “adaption plan” for climate change produced with professors from the federal university suggested strategies to deal with vulnerabilities in areas such as transport, health and housing. But so far little has been done.    Nara Pinto, 38, who lives in the sprawling Rocinha favela and sells snacks on the pavement overlooking Copacabana beach, said the loss of Rio’s famous beaches would cost a lot of jobs.    “The beach is a tourist point,” she said. “What can be done to stop this?  Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro  Shanghai, China  17.5 million people affected  “Shanghai is completely gone – I’d have to move to Tibet!” says resident Wang Liubin, when he is shown projections for the city after 3C of global warming.  When it comes to flooding, the coastal city is one of the world’s most vulnerable. Now one of the world’s biggest ports, the former fishing village is bordered by the Yangtze river in the north and divided through the middle by the Huangpu river; the municipality involves several islands, two long coastlines, shipping ports, and miles of canals, rivers, and waterways.  In 2012, a report from a team of UK and Dutch scientists declared Shanghai the most vulnerable major city in the world to serious flooding, based on factors such as numbers of people living close to the coastline, time needed to recover from flooding, and measures to prevent floodwater. According to Climate Central projections, 17.5 million people could be displaced by rising waters if global temperatures increase by 3C.  Projections show the vast majority of the city could eventually be submerged in water, including much of the downtown area, landmarks such as the Lujiazui skyline and the historical Bund, both airports, and the entirety of its outlying Chongming Island.  Since 2012, the government has been making steady inroads to tackle the threat, including building China’s largest deepwater drainage system beneath the Suzhou Creek waterway, made up of 15km of pipes to drain rainwater across a 58 sq km area. It has also rolled out a 40bn yuan (£5bn) River Flood Discharge project which will stretch for 120km between Lake Taihu and the Huangpu river to try and mitigate the risk of the upstream lake flooding.  Flood prevention walls are being built along the waterfront – in places so high the river is blocked from view – and 200km more are promised across the city’s outlying districts. Flood controls have been put in place along the famous Bund waterfront, where the walkway has been raised to help counter a flood risk, as well as a series of water controls and dams.  Helen Roxburgh in Shanghai  Miami, US  2.7 million people affected  Few other cities in the world have as much to lose from rising sea levels as Miami, and the alarm bells sound ever louder with each successive “king tide” that overwhelms coastal defences and sends knee-deep seawater coursing through downtown streets.  Locals consider this the “new normal” in the biggest city of Florida’s largest metropolitan area, which would simply cease to exist with a 3C temperature rise. Even at 2C, forecasts show almost the entire bottom third of Florida – the area south of Lake Okeechobee currently home to more than 7 million people - submerged, with grim projections for the rest of the state in a little more than half a century. In Miami-Dade county alone, almost $15bn of coastal property is at risk of flooding in just the next 15 years.    A sense of urgency is evident at city hall, where commissioners are asking voters to approve a “Miami Forever” bond in the November ballot that includes $192m for upgrading pump stations, improving drainage and raising sea walls.  “We have a really precious city that many people love and are willing to invest in right now, but it’s going to take some funds to protect it,” said Ken Russell, the city commission’s vice-chair.  Last year, the city of Miami appointed sea-rise expert Jane Gilbert into the newly created role of chief resilience officer with instructions for a robust stormwater management plan that also looks at storm surge, such as that from Hurricane Irma in September which brought significant flooding to downtown Brickell and neighbouring Coconut Grove.  Proposals include elevating roads and even abandoning neighbourhoods to the water to protect others.  “We need universal recognition that we’re all in this together, to protect this amazing global city that we’ve become,” she said.  Natalia Ortiz, who grew up in Miami, fears the future. “It’s very scary,” said Ortiz, who works with Cleo, a climate change advocacy group. “My son is 11 and my daughter is nine, so they’re young but I think about their future, will they be able to raise their children in Miami the way I had the luxury of raising mine?”  Richard Luscombe in Miami  Methodology  Flood maps were created using sea-level rise estimates from Climate Central and digital elevation data.

9874bc11	In a remote region of Antarctica known as Pine Island Bay, 2,500 miles from the tip of South America, two glaciers hold human civilization hostage.  Stretching across a frozen plain more than 150 miles long, these glaciers, named Pine Island and Thwaites, have marched steadily for millennia toward the Amundsen Sea, part of the vast Southern Ocean. Further inland, the glaciers widen into a two-mile-thick reserve of ice covering an area the size of Texas.  There’s no doubt this ice will melt as the world warms. The vital question is when.  The glaciers of Pine Island Bay are two of the largest and fastest-melting in Antarctica. (A Rolling Stone feature earlier this year dubbed Thwaites “The Doomsday Glacier.”) Together, they act as a plug holding back enough ice to pour 11 feet of sea-level rise into the world’s oceans — an amount that would submerge every coastal city on the planet. For that reason, finding out how fast these glaciers will collapse is one of the most important scientific questions in the world today.  To figure that out, scientists have been looking back to the end of the last ice age, about 11,000 years ago, when global temperatures stood at roughly their current levels. The bad news? There’s growing evidence that the Pine Island Bay glaciers collapsed rapidly back then, flooding the world’s coastlines — partially the result of something called “marine ice-cliff instability.”  The ocean floor gets deeper toward the center of this part of Antarctica, so each new iceberg that breaks away exposes taller and taller cliffs. Ice gets so heavy that these taller cliffs can’t support their own weight. Once they start to crumble, the destruction would be unstoppable.  “Ice is only so strong, so it will collapse if these cliffs reach a certain height,” explains Kristin Poinar, a glaciologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “We need to know how fast it’s going to happen.”  In the past few years, scientists have identified marine ice-cliff instability as a feedback loop that could kickstart the disintegration of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet this century — much more quickly than previously thought.  Minute-by-minute, huge skyscraper-sized shards of ice cliffs would crumble into the sea, as tall as the Statue of Liberty and as deep underwater as the height of the Empire State Building. The result: a global catastrophe the likes of which we’ve never seen.  Ice comes in many forms, with different consequences when it melts. Floating ice, like the kind that covers the Arctic Ocean in wintertime and comprises ice shelves, doesn’t raise sea levels. (Think of a melting ice cube, which won’t cause a drink to spill over.)  Land-based ice, on the other hand, is much more troublesome. When it falls into the ocean, it adds to the overall volume of liquid in the seas. Thus, sea-level rise.  Antarctica is a giant landmass — about half the size of Africa — and the ice that covers it averages more than a mile thick. Before human burning of fossil fuels triggered global warming, the continent’s ice was in relative balance: The snows in the interior of the continent roughly matched the icebergs that broke away from glaciers at its edges.  Now, as carbon dioxide traps more heat in the atmosphere and warms the planet, the scales have tipped.  A wholesale collapse of Pine Island and Thwaites would set off a catastrophe. Giant icebergs would stream away from Antarctica like a parade of frozen soldiers. All over the world, high tides would creep higher, slowly burying every shoreline on the planet, flooding coastal cities and creating hundreds of millions of climate refugees.  All this could play out in a mere 20 to 50 years — much too quickly for humanity to adapt.  “With marine ice cliff instability, sea-level rise for the next century is potentially much larger than we thought it might be five or 10 years ago,” Poinar says.  A lot of this newfound concern is driven by the research of two climatologists: Rob DeConto at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and David Pollard at Penn State University. A study they published last year was the first to incorporate the latest understanding of marine ice-cliff instability into a continent-scale model of Antarctica.  Their results drove estimates for how high the seas could rise this century sharply higher. “Antarctic model raises prospect of unstoppable ice collapse,” read the headline in the scientific journal Nature, a publication not known for hyperbole.  Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings. But if carbon emissions continue to track on something resembling a worst-case scenario, the full 11 feet of ice locked in West Antarctica might be freed up, their study showed.  Three feet of sea-level rise would be bad, leading to more frequent flooding of U.S. cities such as New Orleans, Houston, New York, and Miami. Pacific Island nations, like the Marshall Islands, would lose most of their territory. Unfortunately, it now seems like three feet is possible only under the rosiest of scenarios.  At six feet, though, around 12 million people in the United States would be displaced, and the world’s most vulnerable megacities, like Shanghai, Mumbai, and Ho Chi Minh City, could be wiped off the map.  At 11 feet, land currently inhabited by hundreds of millions of people worldwide would wind up underwater. South Florida would be largely uninhabitable; floods on the scale of Hurricane Sandy would strike twice a month in New York and New Jersey, as the tug of the moon alone would be enough to send tidewaters into homes and buildings.  DeConto and Pollard’s breakthrough came from trying to match observations of ancient sea levels at shorelines around the world with current ice sheet behavior.  Around 3 million years ago, when global temperatures were about as warm as they’re expected to be later this century, oceans were dozens of feet higher than today.  Previous models suggested that it would take hundreds or thousands of years for sea-level rise of that magnitude to occur. But once they accounted for marine ice-cliff instability, DeConto and Pollard’s model pointed toward a catastrophe if the world maintains a “business as usual” path — meaning we don’t dramatically reduce carbon emissions.  Rapid cuts in greenhouse gases, however, showed Antarctica remaining almost completely intact for hundreds of years.  Pollard and DeConto are the first to admit that their model is still crude, but its results have pushed the entire scientific community into emergency mode.  “It could happen faster or slower, I don’t think we really know yet,” says Jeremy Bassis, a leading ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan. “But it’s within the realm of possibility, and that’s kind of a scary thing.”  Scientists used to think that ice sheets could take millennia to respond to changing climates. These are, after all, mile-thick chunks of ice.  The new evidence, though, says that once a certain temperature threshold is reached, ice shelves of glaciers that extend into the sea, like those near Pine Island Bay, will begin to melt from both above and below, weakening their structure and hastening their demise, and paving the way for ice-cliff instability to kick in.  In a new study out last month in the journal Nature, a team of scientists from Cambridge and Sweden point to evidence from thousands of scratches left by ancient icebergs on the ocean floor, indicating that Pine Island’s glaciers shattered in a relatively short amount of time at the end of the last ice age.  The only place in the world where you can see ice-cliff instability in action today is at Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland, one of the fastest-collapsing glaciers in the world. DeConto says that to construct their model, they took the collapse rate of Jakobshavn, cut it in half to be extra conservative, then applied it to Thwaites and Pine Island.  But there’s reason to think Thwaites and Pine Island could go even faster than Jakobshavn.  Right now, there’s a floating ice shelf protecting the two glaciers, helping to hold back the flow of ice into the sea. But recent examples from other regions, like the rapidly collapsing Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, show that once ice shelves break apart as a result of warming, their parent glaciers start to flow faster toward the sea, an effect that can weaken the stability of ice further inland, too.  “If you remove the ice shelf, there’s a potential that not just ice-cliff instabilities will start occurring, but a process called marine ice-sheet instabilities,” says Matthew Wise, a polar scientist at the University of Cambridge.  This signals the possible rapid destabilization of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet in this century. “Once the stresses exceed the strength of the ice,” Wise says, “it just falls off.”  And, it’s not just Pine Island Bay. On our current course, other glaciers around Antarctica will be similarly vulnerable. And then there’s Greenland, which could contribute as much as 20 feet of sea-level rise if it melts.  Next to a meteor strike, rapid sea-level rise from collapsing ice cliffs is one of the quickest ways our world can remake itself. This is about as fast as climate change gets.  Still, some scientists aren’t fully convinced the alarm is warranted. Ted Scambos, lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado, says the new research by Wise and his colleagues, which identified ice-cliff instabilities in Pine Island Bay 11,000 years ago, is “tantalizing evidence.” But he says that research doesn’t establish how quickly it happened.  “There’s a whole lot more to understand if we’re going to use this mechanism to predict how far Thwaites glacier and the other glaciers are going to retreat,” he says. “The question boils down to, what are the brakes on this process?”  Scambos thinks it is unlikely that Thwaites or Pine Island would collapse all at once. For one thing, if rapid collapse did happen, it would produce a pile of icebergs that could act like a temporary ice shelf, slowing down the rate of retreat.  Despite the differences of opinion, however, there’s growing agreement within the scientific community that we need to do much more to determine the risk of rapid sea-level rise. In 2015, the U.S. and U.K. governments began to plan a rare and urgent joint research program to study Thwaites glacier. Called “How much, how fast?,” the effort is set to begin early next year and run for five years.  Seeing the two governments pooling their resources is “really a sign of the importance of research like this,” NASA’s Poinar says.  Given what’s at stake, the research program at Thwaites isn’t enough, but it might be the most researchers can get. “Realistically, it’s probably all that can be done in the next five years in the current funding environment,” says Pollard.  He’s referring, of course, to the Trump administration’s disregard for science and adequate scientific funding; the White House’s 2018 budget proposal includes the first-ever cut to the National Science Foundation, which typically funds research in Antarctica.  “It would be sensible to put a huge effort into this, from my perspective,” Pollard says. Structural engineers need to study Antarctica’s key glaciers as though they were analyzing a building, he says, probing for weak spots and understanding how exactly they might fail. “If you vastly increase the research now, [the cost] would still be trivial compared to the losses that might happen.”  Bassis, the ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan, first described the theoretical process of marine ice-cliff instability in research published only a few years ago.  He’s 40 years old, but his field has already changed enormously over the course of his career. In 2002, when Bassis was conducting his PhD research in a different region of Antarctica, he was shocked to return to his base camp and learn that the Larsen B ice shelf had vanished practically overnight.  “Every revision to our understanding has said that ice sheets can change faster than we thought,” he says. “We didn’t predict that Pine Island was going to retreat, we didn’t predict that Larsen B was going to disintegrate. We tend to look at these things after they’ve happened.”  There’s a recurring theme throughout these scientists’ findings in Antarctica: What we do now will determine how quickly Pine Island and Thwaites collapse. A fast transition away from fossil fuels in the next few decades could be enough to put off rapid sea-level rise for centuries. That’s a decision worth countless trillions of dollars and millions of lives.  “The range of outcomes,” Bassis says, “is really going to depend on choices that people make.”  Reporting like this is only possible thanks to the generous support of readers like you.

EAST ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET  This is the last of three dispatches from a New York Times reporting trip to Antarctica.  From the air, the Ross Ice Shelf looks like a vast white plain extending to the horizon. The monochromatic landscape is relieved only occasionally by rocks poking through, or by deep crevasses in the ice itself.  Only at its edge does the ice shelf become something more dramatic: a spectacular sheer cliff rising 100 feet above the ocean and extending 900 feet below the surface. From that cliff edge, icebergs occasionally calve away, completing a thousand-year journey of the ice from land to sea.  Scientists are racing to understand what is happening to the Ross Ice Shelf — and the rest of Antarctica — as the planet warms around it. They are trying to map the thickness of the ice and the shape of the sea floor beneath it in an effort to gauge how vulnerable the shelf may be to collapse, and how soon that could happen.  Scientists are also trying to measure the role of human-caused climate change in weakening some parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet, and to fathom how damaging the seas around the continent might prove to be as they warm over time.  The edge of the Ross Ice Shelf.  The answers carry profound implications for humanity. In the scientists’ worst-case computer simulations, continued global warming will cause the Ross Ice Shelf to weaken and collapse starting as early as the middle of this century.  Right now, the shelf works like a giant bottle-stopper that slows down ice trying to flow from the land into the sea. If it collapses, the ice could flow into the ocean more rapidly, an effect that has already happened on a much smaller scale in other areas of Antarctica.  The most vulnerable parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet could raise the sea level by 10 to 15 feet, inundating many of the world’s coastal cities, though most scientists think that would take well over a century, or perhaps longer. They are worried about a possible rise of as much as six feet by the end of this century.  Whether these alarming forecasts ultimately prove right depends in part on the shape of the sea floor beneath the ice shelf, and in particular on whether it has deep channels that can funnel warming ocean water under the ice shelf and attack the West Antarctic ice sheet from below. A different undersea topography — high ridges of rock, for example — may keep warmer water out, stabilizing the ice sheet, possibly for hundreds of years.  “We’re hoping to figure out how warm water can get to the edge of the ice sheet,” said Robin E. Bell, head of the Columbia University laboratory that sent a team to survey the Ross Ice Shelf late last year. “What are the sort of hidden roads it can go on?”  As they flew back and forth across the vast white landscape in December, the Columbia scientists used some of the world’s most sophisticated geophysical instruments to see into and beneath the ice. As the hours-long flights wore on, the scientists took turns napping, knitting or eating cold pizza, but at all times, somebody kept close watch on the instruments.  Kirsty J. Tinto, the scientist leading the field team, loved watching as the measurements stripped away the illusion that the ice was just a flat, boring pancake.  “You take a slice through it and you can see a thousand years of history, a hundred million years of history,” she said.  Kirsty J. Tinto steps out of an LC-130 Hercules on the Ross Ice Shelf.  The Ross Ice Shelf appears stable now, so the Columbia project will function somewhat like a doctor’s baseline X-ray — a starting point for comparison if the ice starts to deteriorate.  Satellite evidence suggests that this is already happening in other parts of West Antarctica, and many scientists believe that relatively warm ocean water is the culprit. “It’s kind of a blowtorch on the underside of the ice shelf,” said Robert A. Bindschadler, a retired NASA climate scientist.  But the story is not straightforward, and the warmer water attacking the ice has not been linked to global warming — at least not directly. The winds around the continent seem to be strengthening, stirring the ocean and bringing up a layer of warmer water that has most likely been there for centuries.  Are those stronger winds tied to human-caused global warming? Some scientists think so, but others say the case is unproven. “We’re not sure because we don’t have enough data, for long enough, to separate signal from noise,” said Eric J. Steig, a scientist at the University of Washington who has studied temperature trends in Antarctica.  Though the role of global warming is unclear now, it is likely to be a factor in the relatively near future. Many experts think warmer air temperatures could start to weaken the ice of West Antarctica from above, even as warmer ocean water attacks it from below.  The warmer water seems to be doing the most damage to a series of glaciers that flow into a region of West Antarctica called the Amundsen Sea. Satellites have identified the most rapid loss of ice there, raising a critical question: Has an unstoppable collapse of the ice sheet already begun?  Ross Ice Shelf Pine Island Glacier Thwaites Glacier Ross Sea Amundsen Sea Pine Island Glacier Thwaites Glacier Amundsen Sea Red areas have lost significant amounts of ice since 2010.  The Amundsen Sea region is one of the remotest parts of the continent, far from American and British research bases. Working together, the two countries are planning to devote tens of millions of dollars to getting better measurements there, having decided that it is imperative to begin answering questions about the region’s potential collapse.  For instance, scientists need to know a lot more about the ground beneath the glaciers there. Is it slick mud that may allow the ice to flow much faster, or hard rock that may slow down the ice even in a warmer world?  “What we need to know is really the details of what is occurring where the ice, ocean and land all come together,” said Ted A. Scambos, a University of Colorado scientist who is helping to plan the joint research effort.  Unraveling the answers, and gaining a better understanding of how Antarctica’s ice has waxed and waned in the past, may offer a rough guide to the changes that human-caused global warming could wreak in the future.  Already, scientists know enough to be concerned. About 120,000 years ago, before the last ice age, the planet went through a natural warm period, with temperatures similar to those expected in coming decades.  The sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is today, implying that the ice sheets in both Greenland and Antarctica must have partly disintegrated, a warning of what could occur in the relatively near future if the heating of the planet continues unchecked.  But some research suggests that a catastrophe might not yet be inevitable. In a study last year, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and David Pollard of Pennsylvania State University used their computer model to predict what would happen if emissions were reduced sharply over the next few decades, in line with international climate goals.  Under the most ambitious scenarios, they found a strong likelihood that Antarctica would remain fairly stable.  “There’s still a chance that all hell will break loose,” Dr. DeConto said. “But the model is suggesting there’s a way to reduce the risk of a big sea-level rise from Antarctica.”	Miles of Ice Collapsing Into the Sea	true
7f8bf578	President Trump has sometimes claimed that scientists are engaged in a worldwide hoax to fool the public, or that global warming was invented by China to disable American industry. The climate denialists’ arguments have become so strained that even oil and coal companies have distanced themselves publicly, though some still help to finance the campaigns of politicians who espouse such views.  Instead of negotiating over climate change policies and trying to make them more market-oriented, some political conservatives have taken the approach of blocking them by trying to undermine the science.  In theory, they could be. If the sun were to start putting out more radiation, for instance, that would definitely warm the Earth. But scientists have looked carefully at the natural factors known to influence planetary temperature and found that they are not changing nearly enough. The warming is extremely rapid on the geologic time scale, and no other factor can explain it as well as human emissions of greenhouse gases.  Could natural factors be the cause of the warming?  5. Could natural factors be the cause of the warming?  Hard evidence, including studies that use radioactivity to distinguish industrial emissions from natural emissions, shows that the extra gas is coming from human activity. Carbon dioxide levels rose and fell naturally in the long-ago past, but those changes took thousands of years. Geologists say that humans are now pumping the gas into the air much faster than nature has ever done.  How do we know humans are responsible for the increase in carbon dioxide?  4. How do we know humans are responsible for the increase in carbon dioxide?  Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.  In the 19th century, scientists discovered that certain gases in the air trap and slow down heat that would otherwise escape to space. Carbon dioxide is a major player; without any of it in the air, the Earth would be a frozen wasteland. The first prediction that the planet would warm as humans released more of the gas was made in 1896. The gas has increased 43 percent above the pre-industrial level so far, and the Earth has warmed by roughly the amount that scientists predicted it would.  We’ve known about it for more than a century. Really.  What is the greenhouse effect, and how does it cause global warming?  3. What is the greenhouse effect, and how does it cause global warming?  As of early 2017, the Earth had warmed by roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (more than 1 degree Celsius) since 1880, when records began at a global scale. The number may sound low, but as an average over the surface of an entire planet, it is actually high, which explains why much of the world’s land ice is starting to melt and the oceans are rising at an accelerating pace. If greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked, scientists say, the global warming could ultimately exceed 8 degrees Fahrenheit, which would undermine the planet’s capacity to support a large human population.  President Trump has claimed that scientists stopped referring to global warming and started calling it climate change because “the weather has been so cold” in winter. But the claim is false. Scientists have used both terms for decades.  You can think of global warming as one type of climate change. The broader term covers changes beyond warmer temperatures, such as shifting rainfall patterns.  Both are accurate, but they mean different things.  In many other cases, though — hurricanes, for example — the linkage to global warming for particular trends is uncertain or disputed. Scientists are gradually improving their understanding as computer analyses of the climate grow more powerful.  Scientists have published strong evidence that the warming climate is making heat waves more frequent and intense . It is also causing heavier rainstorms , and coastal flooding is getting worse as the oceans rise because of human emissions. Global warming has intensified droughts in regions like the Middle East, and it may have strengthened a recent drought in California.  The risk is that the rate will increase still more. Scientists who study the Earth’s history say waters could rise by a foot per decade in a worst-case scenario, though that looks unlikely. Many experts believe that even if emissions stopped tomorrow, 15 or 20 feet of sea level rise is already inevitable, enough to flood many cities unless trillions of dollars are spent protecting them. How long it will take is unclear. But if emissions continue apace, the ultimate rise could be 80 or 100 feet.  The ocean has accelerated and is now rising at a rate of about a foot per century, forcing governments and property owners to spend tens of billions of dollars fighting coastal erosion. But if that rate continued, it would probably be manageable, experts say.  The simple reality is that people are already feeling the effects, whether they know it or not. Because of sea level rise, for instance, some 83,000 more residents of New York and New Jersey were flooded during Hurricane Sandy than would have been the case in a stable climate, scientists have calculated. Tens of thousands of people are already dying in heat waves made worse by global warming. The refugee flows that have destabilized politics around the world have been traced in part to climate change. Of course, as with almost all other social problems, poor people will be hit first and hardest.  Over the coming 25 or 30 years, scientists say, the climate is likely to gradually warm, with more extreme weather. Coral reefs and other sensitive habitats are already starting to die . Longer term, if emissions rise unchecked, scientists fear climate effects so severe that they might destabilize governments, produce waves of refugees , precipitate the sixth mass extinction of plants and animals in the Earth’s history, and melt the polar ice caps, causing the seas to rise high enough to flood most of the world’s coastal cities. The emissions that create those risks are happening now, raising deep moral questions for our generation.  1. Are there any realistic solutions to the problem?  Yes, but change is happening too slowly.  Society has put off action for so long that the risks are now severe, scientists say. But as long as there are still unburned fossil fuels in the ground, it is not too late to act. The warming will slow to a potentially manageable pace only when human emissions are reduced to zero. The good news is that they are now falling in many countries as a result of programs like fuel-economy standards for cars, stricter building codes and emissions limits for power plants. But experts say the energy transition needs to speed up drastically to head off the worst effects of climate change.  2. What is the Paris Agreement?  Virtually every country agreed to limit future emissions.  The landmark deal was reached outside Paris in December 2015. The reductions are voluntary and the pledges do not do enough to head off severe effects. But the agreement is supposed to be reviewed every few years so that countries ramp up their commitments. President Trump announced in 2017 that he would pull the United States out of the deal, though that will take years, and other countries have said they would go forward regardless of American intentions.  3. Does clean energy help or hurt the economy?  Job growth in renewable energy is strong.  The energy sources with the lowest emissions include wind turbines, solar panels, hydroelectric dams and nuclear power stations. Power plants burning natural gas also produce fewer emissions than those burning coal. Converting to these cleaner sources may be somewhat costlier in the short term, but they could ultimately pay for themselves by heading off climate damages and reducing health problems associated with dirty air. And expansion of the market is driving down the costs of renewable energy so fast that it may ultimately beat dirty energy on price alone — it already does in some areas.  The transition to cleaner energy certainly produces losers, like coal companies, but it also creates jobs. The solar industry in the United States now employs more than twice as many people as coal mining.  4. What about fracking or ‘clean coal’?  Both could help clean up the energy system.  Hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” is one of a set of drilling technologies that has helped produce a new abundance of natural gas in the United States and some other countries. Burning gas instead of coal in power plants reduces emissions in the short run, though gas is still a fossil fuel and will have to be phased out in the long run. The fracking itself can also create local pollution.  “Clean coal” is an approach in which the emissions from coal-burning power plants would be captured and pumped underground. It has yet to be proven to work economically, but some experts think it could eventually play a major role.  5. What’s the latest with electric cars?  Sales are still small overall, but they are rising fast.  The cars draw power at night from the electric grid and give off no pollution during the day as they move around town. They are inherently more efficient than gasoline cars and would represent an advance even if the power were generated by burning coal, but they will be far more important as the electric grid itself becomes greener through renewable power. The cars are improving so fast that some countries are already talking about banning the sale of gasoline cars after 2030.  6. What are carbon taxes, carbon trading and carbon offsets?  It’s just jargon for putting a price on pollution.  The greenhouse gases being released by human activity are often called “carbon emissions” for short. That is because two of the most important gases, carbon dioxide and methane, contain carbon. (Some other pollutants are lumped into the same category, even if they do not actually contain carbon.) When you hear about carbon taxes, carbon trading and so on, these are just shorthand descriptions of methods to put a price on emissions, which economists say is one of the most important steps society could take to limit them.  7. Climate change seems so overwhelming. What can I personally do about it?  Start by sharing this with 50 of your friends.  Experts say the problem can only be solved by large-scale, collective action. Entire states and nations have to decide to clean up their energy systems, using every tool available and moving as quickly as they can. So the most important thing you can do is to exercise your rights as a citizen, speaking up and demanding change.  You can also take direct personal action to reduce your carbon footprint in simple ways that will save you money. You can plug leaks in your home insulation to save power, install a smart thermostat, switch to more efficient light bulbs, turn off unused lights, drive fewer miles by consolidating trips or taking public transit, waste less food, and eat less meat.  Taking one or two fewer plane rides per year can save as much in emissions as all the other actions combined. If you want to be at the cutting edge, you can look at buying an electric or hybrid car or putting solar panels on your roof. If your state has a competitive electricity market, you may be able to buy 100 percent green power.  Leading corporations, including large manufacturers like carmakers, are starting to demand clean energy for their operations. You can pay attention to company policies, support the companies taking the lead, and let the others know you expect them to do better.	Climate Change Is Complex.

6c7718b5	Temperature records worldwide have been shattered by an unusual global heatwave.  Stifling heat cracked roads and buckled roofs across Britain last week, as Motherwell hit the highest temperature ever recorded in Scotland at 91.8°F (33.2°C).  The heatwave has spread across the world, with Meteo France placing 21 departments across the country on an orange weather alert, while Oman saw the highest nighttime temperature ever recorded on the planet.  At least eight people have been killed by the stifling heat sweeping North America, with Montreal recording its hottest temperature since records began.  Worse still, the stifling temperatures look set to continue across the Northern Hemisphere, meteorologists have warned.  While an isolated heatwave can be put down as an anomaly, the scale of this phenomenon points to global warming as the culprit, scientists said.  Scroll down for video  Records all around the world have been shattered as the entire planet is in the grips of a vicious heatwave (pictured). Sweltering civilians have been basking in the sun as thermometers record never-before-seen temperatures  Montreal (pictured) smashed the previous record for the city's hottest temperature, as readings from earlier this week showed of 97.9 °F (36.6°C)  In a prolonged and unusually intense bout of sunshine, much of the Northern Hemisphere has experienced uncharacteristically warm temperatures.  The scale of this latest phenomenon suggests global warming is to blame, scientists have cautioned.  'Summers keep getting hotter,' said Friederike Otto of the University of Oxford, who conducted extensive research into data from the heatwave that spread Europe in June, July and August 2017.  'Heatwaves are far more intense than when my parents were growing up in the 1950s.  'If we do nothing to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, the kind of extreme heat we saw this past summer will be the norm when my young son is a grown man.'  North America has seen a staggering rise in temperature.  There are already reports of at least eight heat-related deaths in Canada and the United States, stretching back to last weekend, including six in Montreal.  The latter broke the previous record for the city's hottest temperature, as readings from earlier this week showed it reached 97.9 °F (36.6 Celsius).  Denver, the Colorado state capital that famously resides one mile above sea level, also saw a record temperature of 105°F (40.5°C) last week.  That ties with its previous all-time record, which was set July 20 2005.  The swathe of new records are believed to be connected to the intense heat dome that has consumed most of the United States and southeast Canada since late June.  Experts expect the dome to hang over the northeast for at least another week, and predict it will spread west this weekend.  On the other side of the Atlantic ocean, climates are typically milder as a result of the cooling from the Gulf Stream.  But despite this, the summer of 2018 looks set to be one of the hottest on record.  Scotland has experienced the hottest temperature on record, with the UK Met Office reporting Motherwell, which is located some 12 miles (20 km) southeast of Glasgow, hit 91.8°F (33.2°C) on June 28.  The previous Scottish record of 91.2°F (32.9°C) was set in August 2003 at Greycrook.  Additionally, Glasgow had its hottest day on record, hitting 89.4°F (31.9°C).  Over the Irish Sea, temperatures also soared despite cooling breezes rolling off the Atlantic.  Scotland, famed more for its lochs and frigid winters than blistering temperatures, set its hottest temperature on record, with the UK Met Office reporting Motherwell, about 12 miles (20 km) southeast of Glasgow, hit 91.8°F (33.2°C) on June 28  Glasgow (pictured) had its hottest day on record, hitting 89.4°F (31.9°C). Over the Irish Sea on the Emerald Isle, temperatures also soared, despite cooling breezes rolling off the Atlantic  Belfast hit a new record of 85.1 degrees (29.5 Celsius) on June 28, as Castlederg in northern Ireland set a new record for the UK as a whole, topping out at 86.2°F (30.1°C) the following day.  Meteorologist Emma Salter told the Daily Express: 'High pressure over the country will slip away on Wednesday and Thursday so it will be a couple of degrees fresher, unfortunately this will be barely noticeable.  'There is another area of high pressure which will take charge later this week and temperatures will creep up towards the weekend when we could be back to 30°C.  'There will be a bit of cloud over the south which might make it feel slightly cooler but this will clear pretty rapidly.  'Then we are back to stunning blue skies and sunshine and there is no sign of this weather breaking right up until the middle of July which is unusual.  'The long-range trend is for above-average temperatures staying until the end of July with only a couple of changeable spells in this period.'  Public health England (PHE) has issued a level two health warning with regards to the unusual heat.  HOW HOT HAS EUROPE BEEN IN THE HEATWAVE? Excessive heat scorched the British Isles last week. The stifling heat caused roads and roofs to buckle, the Weather Channel reported, and resulted in multiple record highs: Scotland provisionally set its hottest temperature on record as Motherwell reached 91.8°F (33.2°C) on June 28. The previous record was 32.9°C set in August 2003 at Greycrook  In Ireland, on June 28 Belfast also reached a record high, as it hit 85.1°F (29.5°C). Shannon also hit its own record at 89.6°F (32°C).  In Northern Ireland, Castlederg hit 86.2°F (30.1°C) on June 29, its record. Advertisement  On the eastern side of the Atlantic ocean, climates tend to be milder as a result of the Gulf Stream. Despite this, the summer of 2018 is becoming one of the hottest on record  In the Middle-Eastern nation of Oman, the lowest temperature for 24 hours on June 28 was 108.7°F (42.6°C) in the coastal city of Quriyat (pictured). For reference, Washington DC has never been hotter than 106°F (41°C)  In Ireland, on June 28 Belfast also reached a record high, as it hit 85.1°F (29.5°C). Shannon hit 89.6°F (32°C), its record. In Northern Ireland, Castlederg hit 86.2°F (30.1°C) on June 29, its record  It cautions: 'Temperatures are expected to temporarily reduce a little night and day through the middle of this week, before lighter winds allow higher temperatures across more eastern areas of England during Thursday and to some extent during Friday. This alert has been issued for the maximum duration possible.  'It is very likely to be extended for similar areas later this working week as heat is expected to build towards the weekend and possibly during the following week.  'Even in areas that do not breach their alert criteria, the headline is that it is expected to remain largely dry, often sunny and very warm at times.'  Experts said over the weekend that Britain's heatwave is expected to continue for at least another two weeks.  While the islands in Western Europe smouldered in the heatwave, Eurasia was also basking in a heatwave.  The vast expanse of North America has a huge disparity in average temperatures, with the sun-kissed residents of Texas and Florida far more accustomed to 100°F (37.7°C) heat than the residents north of the US-Canada border. Canadian children have been enjoying Montreal's unusually warm weather (pictured)  Denver, the Colorado capital that famously sits one mile above sea level, also reached new heights. It tied its previous record of 105°F (40.5°C)at the end of June  These records are believed to be stemming from a massive and intense heat dome that has consumed most of the United States and southeast Canada since last week  HOW HOT DID THE AMERICAS REACH DURING THE RECENT HEATWAVE? North America typically sees a huge disparity in average temperatures. However, states across the USA and Canada have seen record temperatures in the last week, as the effects of global warming. Montreal smashed its previous record for the hottest temperature, as readings from earlier this week showed of 97.9 °F (36.6 Celsius)  Denver, the Colorado state capital, tied its all-time high-temperature record of 105 degrees on June 28  Burlington, in Vermont, set its all-time warmest low temperature ever, recording a low of 80°F (27°C) within the 24 hour period on July 2  Ottawa posted its most extreme combination of heat and humidity on July 1 Advertisement  Yerevan, which is located in the previously Soviet state of Armenia, saw temperatures soar to 107.6°F (42°C).  This was the country's hottest day in July, and is tied with the hottest ever day.  Russia, the host nation for the FIFA World Cup this year, is also in the midst of a heatwave.  Several spots across the south of the world's largest country either matched or exceeded their warmest June temperatures.  Quriyat, in Oman, also recorded the highest nighttime temperature ever recorded on the planet, hitting 121.6°F (49°C) on June 26, falling just two degrees short of the all-time heat record for the country, which stands at 123.4°F (50.7°C).  The latest records come months after Pakistan posted the hottest temperature ever seen on Earth.  The sun was so intense, it took the mercury up to in excess of 120°F as it topped out at 122.4 °F (50.2°C).  HOW HOT IS EURASIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST DURING THE GLOBAL HEATWAVE? Whilst the islands in Western Europe smouldered in its own heatwave, Eurasia was baking as well. Yerevan, in the previously Soviet state of Armenia, saw temperatures soar to 107.6°F (42°C). This is the hottest day ever seen for July, and ties its hottest day ever. Russia, the host country of the football World Cup this year, is also in the midst of a heatwave. Several spots across the south of the world's largest country either matched or exceeded their warmest June temperatures. In the Middle-Eastern nation of Oman, the lowest temperature for 24 hours on June 28 was 108.7°F (42.6°C) in the coastal city of Quriyat's. For reference, Washington DC has never been hotter than 106°F (41°C). That makes this the highest low-temperature day in recorded history, These fantastical numbers come just months after Pakistan posted the hottest temperature ever seen on Earth.

4d40e3aa	YUKON DELTA NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, Alaska — The Arctic is warming about twice as fast as other parts of the planet, and even here in sub-Arctic Alaska the rate of warming is high. Sea ice and wildlife habitat are disappearing; higher sea levels threaten coastal native villages.  But to the scientists from Woods Hole Research Center who have come here to study the effects of climate change, the most urgent is the fate of permafrost, the always-frozen ground that underlies much of the state.  Starting just a few feet below the surface and extending tens or even hundreds of feet down, it contains vast amounts of carbon in organic matter — plants that took carbon dioxide from the atmosphere centuries ago, died and froze before they could decompose. Worldwide, permafrost is thought to contain about twice as much carbon as is currently in the atmosphere.  Once this ancient organic material thaws, microbes convert some of it to carbon dioxide and methane, which can flow into the atmosphere and cause even more warming. Scientists have estimated that the process of permafrost thawing could contribute as much as 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit to global warming over the next several centuries, independent of what society does to reduce emissions from burning fossil fuels and other activities.  In Alaska, nowhere is permafrost more vulnerable than here, 350 miles south of the Arctic Circle, in a vast, largely treeless landscape formed from sediment brought down by two of the state’s biggest rivers, the Yukon and the Kuskokwim. Temperatures three feet down into the frozen ground are less than half a degree below freezing. This area could lose much of its permafrost by midcentury.  That, said Max Holmes, senior scientist and deputy director of the research center, “has all kinds of consequences both locally for this region, for the animals and the people who live here, as well as globally.”  “It’s sobering to think of this magnificent landscape and how fundamentally it can change over a relatively short time period,” he added.  But on this wide, flat tundra, it takes a practiced eye to see how Alaska is thawing from below.  At one of the countless small lakes that pepper the region, chunks of shoreline that include what had been permafrost have calved off toward the water.  Nearby, across a spongy bed of mosses and lichens, a small boggy depression most likely formed when the ice in the top layers of the permafrost below it melted to water.  In the field, Sarah Ludwig, a Woods Hole research assistant (left), and a student, Laura Jardine, extract a core of permafrost. In the lab, Ms. Jardine cuts the core with a saw. Stash Wislocki, except for last photo, by John Schade  In July, the Woods Hole scientists, along with 13 undergraduate and graduate students working on projects of their own, set up a temporary field station on a nameless lake 60 miles northwest of Bethel, which with a population of 6,000 is the largest town in the region. They drilled permafrost cores with a power auger, took other sediment and water samples and embedded temperature probes in the frozen ground. Later, back in the lab at Woods Hole, they began the process of analyzing the samples for carbon content and nutrients.  The goal is to better understand how thawing permafrost affects the landscape and, ultimately, how much and what mix of greenhouse gases is released.  “In order to know how much is lost, you have to know how much is there,” said Sue Natali, a Woods Hole scientist and permafrost expert.  Even in colder northern Alaska, where permafrost in some parts of the North Slope extends more than 2,100 feet below the surface, scientists are seeing stark changes. Vladimir E. Romanovsky, a permafrost researcher at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, said that temperatures at a depth of 65 feet have risen by 3 degrees Celsius (about 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit) over decades.  Near-surface changes have been even greater. At one northern site, he said, permafrost temperatures at shallow depths have climbed from minus 8 degrees Celsius to minus 3.  “Minus 3 is not that far from zero,” Dr. Romanovsky said. If emissions and warming continue at the same rate, he said, near-surface temperatures will rise above freezing around the middle of the century.  There is plenty of debate among scientists about when and how much of Alaska’s permafrost will thaw. And there is no doubt that thawing of the full depth of permafrost would take millenniums.  But Dr. Romanovsky said that his and others’ work shows that permafrost “is not as stable as people thought.”  In addition to greenhouse gas emissions, thawing wreaks havoc on infrastructure, causing slumping of land when ice loses volume as it turns to water.  The main road in Bethel, where average temperatures have risen about 4 degrees Fahrenheit since the mid-20th century, is more of a washboard than a thoroughfare because of shifting ground. Building foundations in Bethel move and crack as well. Some roads, airport runways and parking areas have to be reinforced with liquid-filled pipes that transfer heat out of the permafrost to keep the ground from slumping.  The thawing of permafrost is a gradual process. Ground is fully frozen in winter, and begins to thaw from the top down as air temperatures rise in spring. As average temperatures increase over years, this thawed, or active, layer can increase in depth.  At the field station, the researchers are especially interested in how wildfires affect the permafrost. Because burning removes some of the vegetation that acts as insulation, the theory is that burning should cause permafrost to thaw more.  In the field, Sarah Ludwig, a Woods Hole research assistant (left), and a student, Laura Jardine, extract a core of permafrost. In the lab, Ms. Jardine cuts the core with a saw. Stash Wislocki, except for last photo, by John Schade  In the field, Sarah Ludwig, a Woods Hole research assistant (left), and a student, Laura Jardine, extract a core of permafrost. In the lab, Ms. Jardine cuts the core with a saw. Stash Wislocki, except for last photo, by John Schade  Parts of the tundra here burned in the 1970s and in the summer of 2015, so the researchers took cores from both burned and unburned areas. Scientists wrestled with the bulky power auger as its stainless steel tube worked its way into the hard permafrost. Cores — often containing thin layers of solid ice — were labeled, packed in a cooler and sent by helicopter to a freezer in Bethel.  Thawing permafrost underneath or at the edge of a lake can cause it to drain like a leaky bathtub. Thawing elsewhere can bring about small elevation changes that can in turn lead to changes in water flow through the landscape, drying out some parts of the tundra and turning others into bogs.  Beyond the local effects on plant and animal life, the landscape changes can have an important climate change impact, by altering the mix of carbon dioxide and methane that is emitted. Although methane does not persist in the atmosphere for as long as carbon dioxide, it has a far greater heat-trapping ability and can contribute to more rapid warming.  So the researchers devote much of their time to studying the flow of water and the carbon and nutrients it contains.  “It’s one of the big questions to tackle – what’s wet and dry now, and what will be wet and dry in the future,” Dr. Natali said. If the decomposing permafrost is wet, there will be less oxygen available to the microbes, so they will produce more methane. If the permafrost is dry, the decomposition will lead to more carbon dioxide.  Estimates vary on how much carbon is currently released from thawing permafrost worldwide, but by one calculation emissions over the rest of the century could average about 1.5 billion tons a year, or about the same as current annual emissions from fossil-fuel burning in the United States.  Already, thawing permafrost and warmer temperatures are being blamed for rising carbon emissions in the Alaskan tundra, both here and farther north. In a study earlier this year, researchers found that bacterial decomposition of thawed permafrost, as well as carbon dioxide produced by living vegetation, continues later into the fall because freezing of the surface is delayed.  The rise in emissions has been so significant, the researchers found, that Alaska may be shifting from a sink, or storehouse, of carbon, to a net source.  Dr. Holmes said that shift was not surprising given the climate trend, and he would expect that sub-Arctic parts of Siberia, Canada and other areas with permafrost may be undergoing similar changes.  “There’s a massive amount of carbon that’s in the ground, that’s built up slowly over thousands and thousands of years,” he said.  “It’s been in a freezer, and that freezer is now turning into a refrigerator.”  Correction August 23, 2017 An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to an estimate of the amount of carbon released from thawing permafrost worldwide. It is 1.5 billion tons a year averaged over the remainder of the century, not 1.5 billions tons a year currently. Correction August 25, 2017 An earlier version of this article misspelled, in one instance, the surname of a permafrost researcher at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. He is Vladimir E.

3edb79e8	Last month was the hottest June ever recorded, the EU‘s satellite agency has announced.  Data provided by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts on behalf of the EU, showed that the global average temperature for June 2019 was the highest on record for the month.  The data showed European average ​temperatures were more than 2C above normal and temperatures were 6-10C above normal over most of France, Germany and northern Spain during the final days of the month, according to C3S.  The global average temperature was about 0.1C higher than during the previous warmest June in 2016.  Experts have said climate change made last week’s record-breaking European heatwave at least five times as likely to happen, according to recent analysis.

The recent heatwave saw France record the hottest temperature in the country’s history (45.9C) and major wildfires across Spain, where temperatures exceeded 40C.  Germany, Poland and Czech Republic also recorded their highest temperatures for June last week.  Recommended How India copes with heatwaves  C3S admitted it is difficult to directly link the heatwave to climate change but noted that such extreme weather events are expected to become more common due to global warming.  Jean-Noel Thepaut, head of C3S, said: ”Although local temperatures may have been lower or higher than those forecast, our data shows that the temperatures over the southwestern region of Europe during the last week of June were unusually high.

Spikes in European average temperatures of more than 1C above normal have occurred before, such as in 1917 and 1999, but C3S said the recent heatwave was notable because the sudden increase came on top of a general rise of around 1.5C in European temperature over the past 100 years.  In response to the record-breaking heat, Professor Hannah Cloke, natural hazards researcher at the University of Reading, said: “We knew June was hot in Europe, but this study shows that temperature records haven’t just been broken. They have been obliterated.  “This is the hottest June on record in Europe by a country mile, and the warmest June we have ever seen globally.  “Heatwaves occur in any climate, but we know that heatwaves are becoming much more likely due to climate change. The global climate just keeps getting hotter, as greenhouse gases continue to build up, as scientists have predicted for decades.”  However, she added: “Rapid attempts to find links between climate change and single extreme weather events are possible, but often come with many caveats.

It is a measure of how much the climate responds to greenhouse gases. More formally, it is defined as the increase, in degrees Celsius, of average temperatures around the world, after doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and allowing the atmosphere and the oceans to adjust fully to the change. The reason it’s important is that it is the ultimate justification for governmental policies to fight climate change. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says ECS is likely between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius, but it can’t be more precise than that. Which is too bad, because an enormous amount of public policy depends on its value. People who study the impacts of global warming have found that if ECS is low — say, less than two — then the impacts of global warming on the economy will be mostly small and, in many places, mildly beneficial. If it is very low, for instance around one, it means greenhouse gas emissions are simply not worth doing anything about. But if ECS is high — say, around four degrees or more — then climate change is probably a big problem. We may not be able to stop it, but we’d better get ready to adapt to it.

Article content So, somebody, somewhere, ought to measure ECS. As it turns out, a lot of people have been trying, and what they have found has enormous policy implications. To understand why, we first need to delve into the methodology a bit. There are two ways scientists try to estimate ECS. The first is to use a climate model, double the modeled CO2 concentration from the pre-industrial level, and let it run until temperatures stabilize a few hundred years into the future. This approach, called the model-based method, depends for its accuracy on the validity of the climate model, and since models differ quite a bit from one another, it yields a wide range of possible answers. A well-known statistical distribution derived from modeling studies summarizes the uncertainties in this method. It shows that ECS is probably between two and 4.5 degrees, possibly as low as 1.5 but not lower, and possibly as high as nine degrees. This range of potential warming is very influential on economic analyses of the costs of climate change. The second method is to use long-term historical data on temperatures, solar activity, carbon-dioxide emissions and atmospheric chemistry to estimate ECS using a simple statistical model derived by applying the law of conservation of energy to the planetary atmosphere. This is called the Energy Balance method. It relies on some extrapolation to satisfy the definition of ECS but has the advantage of taking account of the available data showing how the actual atmosphere has behaved over the past 150 years.  Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.  Article content The surprising thing is that the Energy Balance estimates are very low compared to model-based estimates. The accompanying chart compares the model-based range to ECS estimates from a dozen Energy Balance studies over the past decade. Clearly these two methods give differing answers, and the question of which one is more accurate is important. Climate modelers have put forward two explanations for the discrepancy. One is called the “emergent constraint” approach. The idea is that models yield a range of ECS values, and while we can’t measure ECS directly, the models also yield estimates of a lot of other things that we can measure (such as the reflectivity of cloud tops), so we could compare those other measures to the data, and when we do, sometimes the models with high ECS values also yield measures of secondary things that fit the data better than models with low ECS values. This argument has been a bit of a tough sell, since the correlations involved are often weak, and it doesn’t explain why the Energy Balance results are so low. The second approach is based on so-called “forcing efficacies,” which is the concept that climate forcings, such as greenhouse gases and aerosol pollutants, differ in their effectiveness over time and space, and if these variations are taken into account the Energy Balance sensitivity estimates may come out higher. This, too, has been a controversial suggestion. A recent Energy Balance ECS estimate was just published in the Journal of Climate by Nicholas Lewis and Judith Curry. There are several features that make their study especially valuable. First, they rely on IPCC estimates of greenhouse gases, solar changes and other climate forcings, so they can’t be accused of putting a finger on the scale by their choice of data. Second, they take into account the efficacy issue and discuss it at length. They also take into account recent debates about how surface temperatures should or shouldn’t be measured, and how to deal with areas like the Arctic where data are sparse. Third, they compute their estimates over a variety of start and end dates to check that their ECS estimate is not dependent on the relative warming hiatus of the past two decades.  Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.  Article content It looks like the climate models we have been using for decades need to be revised Their ECS estimate is 1.5 degrees, with a probability range between 1.05 and 2.45 degrees. If the study was a one-time outlier we might be able to ignore it. But it is part of a long list of studies from independent teams (as this interactive graphic shows), using a variety of methods that take account of critical challenges, all of which conclude that climate models exhibit too much sensitivity to greenhouse gases. Policy-makers need to pay attention, because this debate directly impacts the carbon-tax discussion. The Environmental Protection Agency uses social cost of carbon models that rely on the model-based ECS estimates. Last year, two colleagues and I published a study in which we took an earlier Lewis and Curry ECS estimate and plugged it into two of those models. The result was that the estimated economic damages of greenhouse gas emissions fell by between 40 and 80 per cent, and in the case of one model the damages had a 40 per cent probability of being negative for the next few decades — that is, they would be beneficial changes. The new Lewis and Curry ECS estimate is even lower than their old one, so if we re-did the same study we would find even lower social costs of carbon. If ECS is as low as the Energy Balance literature suggests, it means that the climate models we have been using for decades run too hot and need to be revised. It also means that greenhouse gas emissions do not have as big an impact on the climate as has been claimed, and the case for costly policy measures to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions is much weaker than governments have told us. For a science that was supposedly “settled” back in the early 1990s, we sure have a lot left to learn.

4852bd38	"After Category 5 Cyclone Pam tore his country apart, prompting a humanitarian emergency, Vanuatu's President Baldwin Lonsdale pinned at least part of the blame for the islands' predicament on manmade global warming.  The storm, which struck with a ferocity the country had not experienced before in modern history, had sustained winds of 165 miles per hour, with gusts exceeding 200 miles per hour when it roared through the tiny country. It leveled homes and businesses, and stripped trees bare on the most populated island of Efate, including the capital of Port Vila. The death toll stood at 24 on Tuesday, but it is expected to rise as more information begins streaming in from outlying islands that have been cut off from the outside world.  “This is a very devastating cyclone … I term it a monster that has hit Vanuatu,” Lonsdale said at a U.N. disaster summit in Japan, according to The Guardian. “It is a setback for the government and for the people of Vanuatu. … All the development that has taken place has been wiped out.”  He said the cyclone seasons that the nation had experienced were the result of climate change. “We see the level of sea rise … the cyclone seasons, the warm, the rain, all this is affected,” he said.  So, is the president correct to link the devastating cyclone to global warming? Or is the tie so tenuous that it's almost nonexistent? The answer, as it often is in climate science, is far more nuanced than Vanuatu's president portrays it.  Scientists say unusually mild sea surface temperatures and added atmospheric water vapor helped the storm intensify before slamming into Vanuatu. At the same time, rising sea levels likely made the storm more damaging than it would have been just a few decades ago.  Here are the main factors to consider when analyzing the potential ties between Cyclone Pam and the warming climate.  Ocean temperatures are the main suspect  Scientists Mashable contacted said the storm intensified rapidly before hitting Vanuatu, aided by an area of unusually mild ocean waters and favorable atmospheric conditions. Ocean temperatures in the area where the cyclone intensified were up to 2 degrees Celsius above average for this time of year (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).  Some — but not all — of the sea surface temperature anomalies in the Southwest Pacific Ocean are likely related to global warming, according to Kevin Trenberth, a climate researcher with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, as well as other experts.  Global sea surface temperatures, showing an area of extremely warm water near Vanuatu and Australia. Image: NOAA/ESRL  According to Trenberth, about about 0.6 degrees Celsius, or 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit, of the ocean temperature anomalies ""can be blamed on human-induced global warming"" while the rest is ""natural"" and associated with an ongoing El Niño event in the tropical Pacific Ocean.  El Niño is a climate phenomenon that features warmer than average ocean temperatures in much of the tropical Pacific Ocean. It can alter worldwide weather patterns, including tropical cyclone seasons in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.  Whatever the cause, though, the warm ocean waters can supercharge storms like Cyclone Pam, as more evaporation takes place and moisture is added to the air.  ""The atmosphere all around there has some 10 to 20% more moisture in it than a comparable storm in the 1970s would have had. The high sea surface temperatures and the water vapor fueled the storm and undoubtedly increased its intensity and size,"" Trenberth said in an email conversation. ""The winds are stronger, the storm surge is greater on higher sea levels.""  El Niño ""has played a role here on top of global warming. But strong storms can certainly occur in that region anyway (but not this strong). The sea surface temperatures are over 86 degrees Fahrenheit for heaven's sake,"" he said.  An analysis of long-term trends in sea surface temperatures in the region where Cyclone Pam rapidly intensified into a Category 5 monster shows that there has been a warming trend since 1948, although there are considerable uncertainties in this data, says Michael Ventrice, an operational meteorologist at WSI Corporation in Massachusetts. He said it is not clear from the data whether the higher temperatures were a result of natural variations or human effects.  Sea surface temperature departures from average in the vicinity of Vanuatu and Australia as of March 16, 2015. Image: WeatherbellAnalytics  ""The bottom line point is that there has been a long-term warming trend observed in the location where Pam intensified,"" Ventrice said.  Madden and Julian...  Ventrice says Cyclone Pam ""thrived"" in an environment that was well-suited to explosive intensification. These environmental factors included the warm ocean waters that extended deep into the ocean, as well as a natural weather cycle known as the Madden Julian Oscillation, or MJO.  In certain instances, the MJO can encourage the air to rise, forming thunderstorms as well as tropical cyclones. Think of the MJO as a helping hand that likely aided the storm's rapid intensification.  ""The MJO acts to moisten the middle and upper-levels of the atmosphere and reduce vertical wind shear, both are which parameters that are musts for intensification,"" Ventrice said.  Few robust trends in tropical cyclones near Vanuatu  Climate research has shown that tropical cyclones in many ocean basins are becoming stronger and lasting longer than they used to. However, the Southwest Pacific, where Cyclone Pam occurred, is not one of these areas, possibly due to the relative paucity of data there.  Kerry Emanuel, a meteorologist at MIT who is a prominent researcher examining global warming-related trends in tropical storms and hurricanes, told Mashable that not much can be said about trends in the vicinity of Vanuatu.  ""Ironically, this is a part of the world where we do not observe any significant upward trends in tropical cyclone metrics, and few models predict upward trends there as a consequence of global warming,"" he said in an email.  In a post for the blog Realclimate on March 18, Emanuel wrote that there are signs that some parameters of severe tropical cyclones are changing, even in areas like the Southwest Pacific basin where data is relatively sparse.  ""While Pam and Haiyan, as well as other recent tropical cyclone disasters, cannot be uniquely pinned on global warming, they have no doubt been influenced by natural and anthropogenic climate change and they do remind us of our continuing vulnerability to such storms,"" Emanuel said.  Tom Knutson, a researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says that of the six ocean basins that give rise to tropical cyclones, the Southwest Pacific basin is an area that shows the least tendency for an increase in storm activity by the end of the century. In fact, there may be a decrease in cyclone frequency or intensity there, based on the most recent computer model simulations, Knutson says.  James Elsner, a professor at Florida State University who has been investigating how global warming may be altering the strongest storms on Earth, says he would be surprised if South Pacific storms were not growing stronger, like storms elsewhere. But the data is not yet there to prove it.  ""We have a pretty solid basis (physical & empirical) for our understanding that ocean heat makes the strongest tropical cyclones stronger,"" he said. ""Empirically it has been shown for the global as a whole and for the North Atlantic. But the signal is hard to see in noisy data, and especially where confounded by a trend toward fewer cyclones.""  Although global warming signals may not be present yet, multiple studies have shown that manmade global warming is likely to cause tropical cyclones (including hurricanes and typhoons) to be more intense, on average, than they are today, which means these storms will be more destructive. Manmade warming is also likely to lead to an uptick in the number of extremely intense tropical cyclones in some ocean basins during the next several decades, according to peer reviewed research.  Since sea-level rise is already making cyclones more destructive by giving them a higher launching pad for storm surge flooding, this means that future storms may be an order of magnitude more damaging than what we typically experience today.  As a small, low-lying island nation, Vanuatu is acutely aware of rising sea levels due to global warming. Along with other small island countries, some of which were affected by the same cyclone, Vanuatu has lobbied the U.N. in favor of steep greenhouse gas emissions cuts to reduce the severity of climate change, seeing it as a matter of its very survival as a nation."

ebd188a7	"Hurricane Patricia, which is threatening the coast of western Mexico with a catastrophic impact, intensified at rates that were among the fastest scientists have seen anywhere on Earth. The storm went from 60 mph winds to 200 mph in just 30 hours.  By early Friday morning, the storm was the most intense hurricane ever recorded in either the eastern Pacific or entire North Atlantic basin, which also includes the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean.  It's no coincidence that this storm exploded in an area of near-record warm sea surface temperatures that had not yet been tapped by any other recent storms. It's also an area where atmospheric conditions were favorable for such a storm to strengthen.  Consider this: As of 5 a.m. ET on Thursday, the storm had 85 mile-per-hour winds and a minimum central air pressure of 980 millibars. By 5 a.m. ET on Friday, the winds increased to 200 miles per hour, with an air pressure of 880 millibars.  That's an astonishing 100 millibar drop in air pressure in a 24-hour period, which is virtually unheard of. The intensification rate looked like a steep staircase when graphed using a satellite-based computer algorithm that tracks storm intensity.  Chart indicates the rapid intensification rate of Hurricane Patricia. Image: University of Wisconsin  A period of rapid intensification was forecast by most hurricane prediction models, though none foresaw the sheer ferocity that the storm would eventually achieve.  While scientists have made great strides in recent years in understanding what factors cause hurricanes and typhoons to rapidly intensify, there remain some mysteries about this process.  Based on email conversations Mashable had with a half dozen tropical cyclone experts on Friday morning, here's what we know so far.  Warm water served as fuel  The storm exploded over an area of exceptional ocean warmth, with waters of 1 to 2 degrees Celsius above average for this time of year. In addition, the atmospheric conditions in this area were ideally suited for a rapidly strengthening storm, with what is known as ""thermodynamic potential intensity"" readings at a maximum. This occurred right in the area where Patricia spun its way into the record books on Friday morning.  The ocean warmth is largely due to a near-record strong El Niño event, which has not only raised ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific, but has also caused those warm waters to extend deeper below the surface than is usually the case, which also helps storms to intensify.  Sea surface temperature anomaly in the area where Hurricane Patricia intensified. Image: WeatherBell Analytics  In addition, most of the storms that have formed so far this year — and there have been a record number in the eastern tropical Pacific — have formed well west of where Patricia spun up. These left plenty of undisturbed warm water, which is fuel for a storm like this.  ""Basically that area closer to Mexico usually has a lot more tropical cyclones nearby,"" said Eric Blake, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ""Since they were all much farther west, Patricia ended up moving over very warm, untapped waters with the rest of the conditions quite ripe.""  Cooperative atmosphere  Ryan Maue, a meteorologist for the private weather firm WeatherBell Analytics, said ""alarm bells"" were ringing on Thursday based on computer model indications that the storm would intensify quickly.

He said the fact that Patricia is a small storm, with a compact inner core of intense thunderstorms, helped it to ""deepen pressure within a tiny radius of maximum wind."" (The storm is smaller, in area, than Super Typhoon Haiyan and Hurricane Katrina.)  Maue also noted that the ocean temperatures the storm is tapping into are the warmest left in the entire northern hemisphere at this date, at about 31 degrees Celsius, or 88 degrees Fahrenheit.  But is this intensification rate an indication of how global warming is altering the characteristics and behavior of nature's most powerful storms? That's a harder question to answer at this point, scientists told Mashable.  Tropical cyclone potential intensity as of Oct. 19, 2015, showing the highest value near where Hurricane Patricia intensified. Image: Kerry Emanuel  Kerry Emanuel, a hurricane expert at MIT, said the lack of a consistent record of eastern Pacific storms using hurricane hunter flights makes it difficult to determine if there is a global warming-related trend in such storms. Such flights are typically flown in the Atlantic and only occasionally in the eastern Pacific, so this was an exceptional case.  ""There is no question that this is an exceptionally intense tropical cyclone,"" he wrote. ""But I wonder whether we really know that prior storms in the region have not been equally intense and we are just lucky to have measured this one.""  Global warming considerations  Maue, for his part, said hurricanes tend to respond to more localized conditions when intensifying or weakening, rather than global trends.  ""Hurricanes respond locally, and rapid/explosive intensification changes due to climate change could be a result but hard to say with just one storm during a strong El Niño,"" he wrote.  Kevin Trenberth, a senior climate researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, said the unusually mild ocean temperatures are allowing more moisture to flow into the storm, which adds fuel to the fire.  Trenberth's research has shown that global warming has increased the available water vapor for storms around the world, which plays a role in everything from more intense local downpours to hurricanes.  ""The moisture flowing into the storm, that provides its primary fuel, must be higher than it has ever been before,"" he wrote. ""It still requires the right setup to convert that into an intense storm, but the environment is surely ripe. That consists, of course, of a substantial El Niño-related component, but also the background global warming that has a memory through the ocean heat content.""  According to Trenberth, El Niño has redistributed ocean heat across the tropical Pacific, putting a bullseye of heat right underneath Hurricane Patricia.  ""This is the warmest large-scale spot in the hemisphere,"" Trenberth said. This causes moisture to rush toward that area from relatively cooler ocean waters around it.  Sea levels off the coast of Mexico are about 8 inches above average because of the warm bulge of water (water expands as it is heated). ""The subsurface ocean is exceptionally warm as well as the sea surface,"" he said.  It's not just El Niño that's boosting ocean temperatures in the eastern Pacific, either. Other natural climate cycles are contributing too, according to hurricane researcher Gabriel Vecchi of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey.  ""To answer which factors was dominant, and by how much, would take a systematic analysis — so I don't think I'm willing to shoot for the hip to tell you which ones are important this year, much less for this particular storm,"" he said. ""But it's my opinion that there will be time, and there are ways, to assess the impacts of these factors in the future.""  According to Vecchi, projections do show that global warming will increase ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific, which could bring more hurricanes like this one.  Tom Knutson, who works in Princeton with Vecchi, told Mashable that a new study shows that the northeast Pacific basin, where Hurricane Patricia is located, will have the largest future increase in the frequency of Category 4 and 5 storms of anywhere on Earth, which he says is ""probably just a coincidence.""  He said computer modeling studies that he and his colleagues have published show that manmade warming will increase storm intensities in the future, and that this trend may already have begun to a ""small"" extent in the northeast Pacific.  Knutson cautioned that observations of northeast Pacific storms do not show such a trend yet, at least for the period from 1982 to 2009."

56696255	"There's something about a warm February day that reminds you that something just isn't right. It gives you that nagging feeling that maybe global warming is real after all.  February 2017 has featured prolonged warm weather the likes of which many areas have not seen before, or have only experienced on rare occasions.  Taken as a whole, the month-to-date in the U.S. has seen a ridiculously lopsided ratio of daily record highs to daily record lows, which is a key indicator of short-term weather variability and, over the longer term, human-caused climate change.  For individual days' worth of warm weather, you mainly have the jet stream to thank. This current of fast-moving air at about 35,000 feet above the ground has been steering a never-ending series storms into the West Coast, where California's mountains have picked up a crazy 500 inches of snow so far, and then moved across the U.S. in a way that has cut off flow of frigid air from the Arctic.  While transient weather variability is playing a key role here, the widespread record warmth across the U.S. so far this year is part of a long-term trend toward more warm temperature records versus cold ones.  Me enjoying this weather but knowing our Earth is danger pic.twitter.com/Jy6bINvZ6C — breanna (@bre_lliant) February 19, 2017  This February offers a vivid illustration of this trend.  Through Feb. 23, daily record highs have been blowing away daily record lows by a far greater than 100-to-1 ratio, which, if it holds for a few more days, would itself set a record. So far this month, there have been nearly 5,000 daily record highs set or tied, compared to just 42 daily record lows. (Although this records ratio might need an asterisk, considering the short calendar month.)  And it's not the daily records that are most impressive, but rather the number of monthly records that are being tied or broken from the Gulf Coast all the way to the Midwest and northeastward into Canada. During the past week alone (not including Feb. 23), there were 736 daily record highs set or tied in the U.S., compared to zero daily record lows for the same period.  Even more startling is the number of record warm overnight temperatures set or tied in the past seven days, which total a whopping 940. There were no record cold overnight low temperatures set or tied during the same period.  And the monthly records, which are far harder to break than daily milestones, are astounding.  Temperature anomaly across North America for Feb. 19 as seen through the GFS computer model. Image: weatherbell analytics  According to the National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) in Asheville, North Carolina, February has seen 336 monthly record highs set or tied, along with 203 records set or tied for the warmest overnight minimum temperature. In comparison, there was not a single monthly cold temperature record set or tied through Feb. 23.  These figures do not include monthly temperature records that were broken on Friday, which included 73 degrees in Boston, shattering the previous record by 3 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, Allentown, Pennsylvania hit a remarkable 77 degrees, and Binghamton, New York reached 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Dayton, Cincinatti and Columbus Ohio each either tied or broke their monthly high temperature records on Friday as well, with numerous monthly milestones set on Thursday, too.  In Albany, New York, the high temperature of 74 degrees on Thursday was the warmest temperature on record for any day during the months of December, January and February.

Milwaukee, for example, broke its monthly all-time record high for February when the temperature reached 71 degrees Fahrenheit, and Madison set a monthly record with a high of 68 degrees Fahrenheit.  Chicago hit 70° today for the 5th time during Feb. since 1871. Also happened Saturday. Highest Feb. temp of 75° (2/27/1976) in jeopardy Wed. — NWS Chicago (@NWSChicago) February 20, 2017  In Ottumwa, Iowa, where the ground would normally be snow-covered this time of year, the high on Wednesday was 79 degrees, which set a monthly record as well. Some cities set records for the longest stretch of February warmth they've seen, including Kansas City, which set a seven-day February warmth record on Wednesday, according to weather.com.  On Monday, Chicago had a high temperature of 70 degrees, which was only the fifth time that has happened in any February in the ""Windy City."" (The fourth time also came this February.)  The warm weather in the Midwest was enabled by a marked lack of snow cover and lake ice across the Great Lakes, which allowed air temperatures to soar on mild southwesterly winds for days on end. As of Feb. 22, just 19.1 percent of the lower 48 states were snow-covered, far below average for this time of year.  While cold air is staging a comeback across the Midwest, where heavy snow is predicted to fall from Nebraska into Wisconsin, much of the South and East is likely to stay milder than average for at least a few more days.  Where's the snow? Image: noaa  The warm weather in the U.S. hasn't been a freak phenomenon only occurring for the past few weeks, either. The year-to-date is averaging a record daily highs to record daily lows ratio of more than 4-to-1, and studies have shown that over the past several decades, human-caused global warming has increased the odds of warm temperature records so that these ratios are becoming more and more skewed.  And the warmth isn't just limited to the U.S., either, with the planet recording its 3rd-warmest January on record, after its warmest year so far in 2016. This continues the long-term warming of about 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit since reliable surface temperatures began in 1880.  As the planet warms in response to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the ratio of high temperature records compared to low temperature records has become more skewed. If the climate weren't warming, that long-term ratio should average out to about 1-to-1.  However, that isn't the world we're living in. A 2009 study found that the record highs to lows ratio was 2-to-1 for the lower 48 states during the 2000s, and this disparity has only grown since then, though not evenly across every part of the country. Projections show the imbalance increasing in coming decades as global warming continues, possibly to as high as 15-to-1 if emissions of planet-warming pollutants such as carbon dioxide continue apace.  ""One thing I remind myself when comparing contemporary events to trends or patterns is that the contemporary events themselves make up the trends and patterns,"" said Deke Arndt, who leads the climate monitoring branch at NCEI. ""This is a real-time view into what we will call ""recent trends"" in a few years.""  ""This week has been an up close look at the DNA of what we are seeing in the big picture: relative to historical norms, extreme heat continues to outpace extreme cold across almost every place, season and time of day in the USA.""  While individual months will still vary from this trend, it's clear that over the long-term, the ratio of record highs to record lows is now strongly favoring record highs as well as record warm overnight temperatures. This is consistent with computer model projections of a warming world.  In other words, if you like 70-degree February days in Washington, D.C., you're in luck.  The odds are (increasingly) ever in your favor."	Here’s why it's so frickin’ hot right now	true
b27e8cff	"Australia's Great Barrier Reef is one of the world's greatest reservoirs of biodiversity.  A World Heritage site, it is currently under assault from unusually hot ocean temperatures, which is causing widespread coral bleaching that is damaging and, in some cases, even killing the reefs.  Now a new study by scientists at the Australian Research Council finds that the ongoing bleaching event is mainly due to human-caused global warming, and that if global warming proceeds as currently expected, ""large parts"" of the Great Barrier Reef could die by the mid-2030s.  The study has not yet been submitted for peer review in a scientific journal. And until this study is reviewed and published in a scientific journal, its results should be treated as preliminary, but consistent with other recent climate science research.  The study examines what has caused ocean temperatures to spike to record highs in the Coral Sea region, which encompasses much of the Great Barrier Reef, including the hardest-hit northern reaches.    ""This area has recorded a big increase in temperatures over the past century, with March 2016 being the warmest on record,"" the researchers wrote in a piece published at The Conversation on Thursday, a website that publishes academic works.  Coral bleaching occurs when coral expels the algae that lives in its tissue, giving it color and nutrients. This action, caused by stresses such as increased water temperature and pollution, leaves the coral skeleton exposed, making it more susceptible to heat stress, disease and pollution.

The scientists found that human-caused global warming made the record warm ocean temperatures and related bleaching events seen this year at least 175 times more likely to occur. The analysis found that climate change increased ocean temperatures by 1 degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, during March.  Coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016. Image: Catlin Seaview Survey  The study projects that this year's extreme warmth is likely to occur every two years in the month of March by the year 2034.  The analysis' findings dovetail with other research that has predicted the mass die-off of coral reefs around the planet by the year 2050, as waters warm and exceed the tolerance level of many coral reef systems.  “We have loaded the odds against the survival of one of the world’s greatest natural wonders”  “These extreme temperatures will become commonplace by the 2030s putting a great strain on the ecosystems of the Great Barrier Reef,” said lead author Andrew King of the ARC centre of excellence for climate system science, in a statement.  “We have loaded the odds against the survival of one of the world’s greatest natural wonders,” he said.  Although the study has yet to be peer-reviewed, the methods used to detect the role of climate change in extreme events are becoming more firmly established in the climate science community.  ""We hope to submit a more comprehensive version of this analysis for peer-review soon,"" King told Mashable in an interview.  Such extreme event attribution studies have been used to detect the influence of human-caused global warming in other extreme temperature events.  For this study, researchers looked at temperature data and computer model simulations that included only natural factors that alter the climate, compared to simulations that include human emissions of greenhouse gases.  They found that the simulations that include greenhouse gases best fit the temperature data, and using statistical techniques they calculated the amount of the ocean warming that should be attributed to human-caused global warming, something known as ""fractional attributable risk.""  In a blog post, the researchers said that they released the results prior to peer review ""because of the grave nature of their findings and importance of the Great Barrier Reef to all Australians.""  “We are confident in the results because these kind of attribution studies are well established, but what we found demands urgent action if we are to preserve the reef,” King said.  “For this reason, we felt it was vital to get our findings out as quickly as possible.”  Coral reefs as the tripwire for ""dangerous interference"" with climate  The new analysis adds more evidence for those who argue that global warming may already be causing ""dangerous interference with the climate system.""  That vague phrase from a 1992 U.N. climate treaty established what the nations of the world should work to avoid by cutting emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane.

The Paris Agreement on climate change, which 172 countries signed on April 22, maintains that goal as its ultimate objective, without defining it.  This new analysis suggests we have already crossed into ""dangerous"" territory.  ""The damage to the reef is a very clear indicator of the harm our greenhouse gas emissions are doing to the planet,"" King said.  ""Hopefully this severe bleaching will help to trigger action so that we can curb our emissions.""    A before and after image of the bleaching in American Samoa. The first image was taken in December 2014. The second image was taken in February 2015. Image: Catlin seaview survey  A strong El Niño climate event, combined with the impact of global warming and other factors, has prompted unusually warm ocean temperatures and the world's third-ever global coral bleaching event, which began in 2014 and is expected to continue until 2017.  The bleaching seen in the Coral Sea is part of this event.    Heidi Cullen, the chief scientist for Climate Central in New Jersey who leads a consortium of researchers who conduct extreme event attribution studies, told Mashable that this new analysis ""makes clear the heavy toll of burning fossil fuels.""  ""It is the ultimate alarm bell that we need to drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions right away,"" she said.  Cullen was not involved in the new study.  The projection that much of the Great Barrier Reef could perish within the next few decades could turn out to be too pessimistic, since other research has shown that some species of corals are surprisingly resilient to the stress from changing ocean temperatures.                          In a press release on March 29, the Australian Coral Bleaching Task Force announced that the northern portions of the Great Barrier Reef are in the throes of the most intense coral bleaching event on record there.  The Task Force, comprised of 10 Australian research institutions, made its determination after completing aerial surveys of more than 500 coral reefs from Cairns north to Papua New Guinea.  “This has been the saddest research trip of my life,” says Prof. Terry Hughes, convener of the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce, said in a press release.  “Almost without exception, every reef we flew across showed consistently high levels of bleaching, from the reef slope right up onto the top of the reef,"" Hughes said.  ""We flew for 4,000 kilometers in the most pristine parts of the Great Barrier Reef, and saw only four reefs that had no bleaching. The severity is much greater than in earlier bleaching events in 2002 or 1998.”  The ongoing global bleaching event is the longest-lasting one ever observed, and only the third ever seen. It has occurred during the warmest year on record, which occurred in 2015, and the two most unusually mild months on Earth, which took place in January and February, respectively.  “This has been the saddest research trip of my life”  It is due to record warm ocean temperatures around the world, partly driven by a strong El Niño event in the tropical Pacific Ocean."

d53cf548	"Republican lawmaker: Rocks tumbling into ocean causing sea level rise  Originally published by E&E News  The Earth is not warming. The White Cliffs of Dover are tumbling into the sea and causing sea levels to rise. Global warming is helping grow the Antarctic ice sheet.  Those are some of the skeptical assertions echoed by Republicans on the U.S. House of Representatives Science, Space and Technology Committee yesterday. The lawmakers at times embraced research that questions mainstream climate science during a hearing on how technology can be used to address global warming.  A leading climate scientist testifying before the panel spent much of the two hours correcting misstatements.  The purpose of the hearing was to focus on how technology could be deployed for climate change adaptation. But the hearing frequently turned to the basics of climate science. Many of the questions by Republicans and Democrats alike were directed to Philip Duffy, president of the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts and former senior adviser to the U.S. Global Change Research Program.  Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) said he was bothered that established climate science has not been questioned more by the committee, which has accused federal climate scientists of fraudulently manipulating climate data and subpoenaed their records.  ""I'm a little bit disturbed by, No. 1, over and over again, I hear, 'Don't ever talk about whether mankind is the main cause of the temperature changing and the climate changing,'"" he said. ""That's a little disturbing to hear constantly beaten into our heads in a Science Committee meeting, when basically we should all be open to different points of view.""  Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), chairman of the committee, entered into the record an opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal yesterday that claimed sea levels are not rising because of climate change, a view that rejects thousands of scientific studies. The piece was written by Fred Singer, who is affiliated with the Heartland Institute in Chicago, Illinois, which promotes the rejection of mainstream climate science.  ""To solve climate change challenges, we first need to acknowledge the uncertainties that exist,"" Smith said in his opening remarks. ""Then we can have confidence that innovations and technology will enable us to mitigate any adverse consequences of climate change.""  At one point, Smith showed a slide of two charts that he said demonstrated how the rate of sea-level rise does not equal the sharp spike in the consumption of fossil fuels. When Smith pointed out that rates of sea-level rise have only increased slightly compared with the rate of fossil fuel use, Duffy pointed out that his chart was from a single tide gauge station, near San Francisco, and that sea levels rise at different rates around the world. Smith did not show rising atmospheric CO 2 levels or temperatures, both of which have climbed steadily in recent decades as emissions have increased.  Every time you have that soil or rock or whatever it is that is deposited into the seas, that forces the sea levels to rise, because now you have less space in those oceans, because the bottom is moving up. Representative Mo Brooks (R–AL)  ""The rate of global sea-level rise has accelerated and is now four times faster than it was 100 years ago,"" Duffy told Smith in response to the charts.  ""Is this chart inaccurate, then?"" Smith asked.  ""It's accurate, but it doesn't represent what's happening globally; it represents what's happening in San Francisco,"" Duffy said.  Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) questioned Duffy on the factors that contribute to sea-level rise, pointing out that land subsidence plays a role, as well as human activity.  Brooks then said that erosion plays a significant role in sea-level rise, which is not an idea embraced by mainstream climate researchers. He said the California coastline and the White Cliffs of Dover tumble into the sea every year, and that contributes to sea-level rise. He also said that silt washing into the ocean from the world's major rivers, including the Mississippi, the Amazon and the Nile, is contributing to sea-level rise.  ""Every time you have that soil or rock or whatever it is that is deposited into the seas, that forces the sea levels to rise, because now you have less space in those oceans, because the bottom is moving up,"" Brooks said.  Duffy responded: ""I'm pretty sure that on human time scales, those are minuscule effects.""  Brooks added that Antarctic ice is growing. That was true a few years ago, and scientists say it does not disprove the theory of global warming because different factors affect the Arctic and Antarctic rates of melting.  ""We have satellite records clearly documenting a shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage,"" Duffy said.  ""I'm sorry, but I don't know where you're getting your information, but the data I have seen suggests — "" Brooks said.  Duffy answered: ""The National Snow and Ice Data Center and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.""  ""Well, I've got a NASA base in my district, and apparently, they're telling you one thing and me a different thing,"" Brooks said. ""But there are plenty of studies that have come that show with respect to Antarctica that the total ice sheet, particularly that above land, is increasing, not decreasing. Now, you could make a different argument if you want to talk about Greenland or the Arctic.""  Earlier this year, NASA researchers determined that Antarctica's ice loss has accelerated in the last decade. More broadly, sea ice extent at both poles set a record low last year. Scientists are racing to better understand the changes occurring in Antarctica because much of its ice is land-based, meaning it could drive sea-level rise around the world as it melts.  Rep. Bill Posey (R-FL) said scientists said in the 1970s that the Earth was cooling, a popular talking point of climate skeptics and the subject of a fake Time magazine cover that has become a meme. Duffy corrected him and said that was essentially an outlier position at the time and that scientists long ago determined that humans were warming the planet.  Posey also asked how carbon dioxide could be captured in permafrost in the periods before humans existed. Duffy told him that it was from non-decayed organic matter. Human activity is now causing the Arctic to warm and thaw the ground, releasing the carbon into the atmosphere, Duffy said.  Posey then asked about theories related to warming being beneficial for habitats and to people.  ""What do you say to people who theorize that the Earth as it continues to warm is returning to its normal temperature?"" Posey asked.  ""Look, if you want to characterize a temperature above today's temperature as normal, you're free to do that, but that doesn't mean that's a planet we want to live on,"" Duffy said.  ""I don't want to get philosophical; I'm trying to stay on science here,"" Posey said.  ""I'm not getting philosophical; I'm getting extremely practical,"" Duffy said. ""I'm being extremely practical — if we let the planet warm 2 or 3 degrees, we will have tens of meters of sea-level rise, and the community where I live will essentially cease to exist.""  Posey responded: ""I don't think anybody disputes that the Earth is getting warmer; I think what's not clear is the exact amount of who caused what, and getting to that is, I think, where we're trying to go with this committee.""  Correction, 5/17/2018, 12:35 p.m.: A previous version of this story mischaracterized a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, which claimed climate change is not the cause of sea-level rise.

a2580111	The oldest and thickest sea ice in the Arctic has started to break up, opening waters north of Greenland that are normally frozen, even in summer.  This phenomenon – which has never been recorded before – has occurred twice this year due to warm winds and a climate-change driven heatwave in the northern hemisphere.  One meteorologist described the loss of ice as “scary”. Others said it could force scientists to revise their theories about which part of the Arctic will withstand warming the longest.  The sea off the north coast of Greenland is normally so frozen that it was referred to, until recently, as “the last ice area” because it was assumed that this would be the final northern holdout against the melting effects of a hotter planet.  But abnormal temperature spikes in February and earlier this month have left it vulnerable to winds, which have pushed the ice further away from the coast than at any time since satellite records began in the 1970s.  “Almost all of the ice to the north of Greenland is quite shattered and broken up and therefore more mobile,” said Ruth Mottram of the Danish Meteorological Institute. “Open water off the north coast of Greenland is unusual. This area has often been called ‘the last ice area’ as it has been suggested that the last perennial sea ice in the Arctic will occur here. The events of the last week suggest that, actually, the last ice area may be further west.”  Ice to the north of Greenland is usually particularly compacted due to the Transpolar Drift Stream, one of two major weather patterns that push ice from Siberia across the Arctic to the coastline, where it packs.  Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, said: “The ice there has nowhere else to go so it piles up. On average, it’s over four metres thick and can be piled up into ridges 20 metres thick or more. This thick, compacted ice is generally not easily moved around.  “However, that was not the case this past winter (in February and March) and now. The ice is being pushed away from the coast by the winds.”  Q&A How is climate change affecting the Arctic? Show The world may have warmed by about 1C (1.8F) over the past century but the Arctic far outstrips this global average and is warming at about twice the rate of the rest of the world. In places, the rate of warming has been astonishing. Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqiaġvik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979. In the summer of 2019, an Arctic heatwave had parts of Greenland reach temperatures 40C hotter than normal. The Arctic is dominated by sea ice, unlike the Antarctic, which is essentially a huge land-based ice sheet. As the ocean and atmosphere warm, sea ice is shrinking in extent, at about 13% a decade since 1979, according to Nasa. The bright white surface of ice, known as albedo, is giving way to the dark ocean, meaning that sunlight is being absorbed rather than reflected, amplifying the warming effect. These rapid and unprecedented changes are transforming the Arctic and threatening traditional ways of life, according to US government scientists in a 2019 report card. The sea ice is younger, thinner, more fragile and less extensive, making hunting on the ice harder and more perilous. The marine ecosystem is shifting as warmer water forces fish species to retreat to more northern waters. What is a significant challenge to communities in the Arctic, is a boon to the shipping industry, which can navigate the area more easily. This task will become even simpler once the Arctic is ice-free in summertimes, forecast as soon as the 2040s.  Ice is easier to blow around as a result of a warming trend, which has accelerated over the past 15 years. “The thinning is reaching even the coldest part of the Arctic with the thickest ice. So it’s a pretty dramatic indication of the transformation of the Arctic sea ice and Arctic climate.”  “Scary,” wrote Thomas Lavergne, a scientist at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, in a retweet of a satellite-gif of the blue water penetrating white ice and exposing hundreds of miles of the Greenland coastline.  So the open water / low concentration patch North for Greenland is still there (and slowly moving westward). Nice and scary. From https://t.co/jPx1JmNayA https://t.co/hGstLYafcW — Thomas Lavergne (@lavergnetho) August 13, 2018  He said this would flush chunks of thicker ice out through the Fram or Nares Straits into warmer southern waters.  “I cannot tell how long this open water patch will remain open, but even if it closes in few days from now, the harm will be done: the thick old sea ice will have been pushed away from the coast, to an area where it will melt more easily,” he added.  This year’s openings are driven more by wind than melting but they have occurred during two temperature spikes. In February, the Kap Morris Jesup weather station in the region is usually below -20C, but earlier this year there were 10 days above freezing and warm winds, which unlocked the ice from the coast.  Arctic sea ice extent for 15 August 2018 was 5.7m sq km (2.2m sq miles). The orange line shows the 1981 to 2010 average extent for that day. Photograph: NSIDC  Last week, the crack opened again after Kap Morris Jesup briefly registered a record high of 17C and strong southerly winds picked up to 11 knots. Experts predict that coastal seas will freeze again but probably later than normal.  “I think that solar heating of the water column will increase during this opening and this will delay freeze-up and ice formation,” said Rasmus Tage Tonboe, a sea ice expert at the the Danish Meteorological Institute.  The latest readings by the Norwegian Ice Service show that Arctic ice cover in the Svalbard area this week is 40% below the average for this time of year since 1981. In the past month, at least 14 days in the past month have hit record lows in this region. Although thinner ice elsewhere in the Arctic means this is unlikely to be a record low year overall, they are in line with predictions that there will be no summer ice in the Arctic Ocean at some point between 2030 and 2050.  Keld Qvistgaard, the ice service coordinator in Denmark, said this was not the first time a gap had appeared between the shore and the main ice pack but the one formed from 1 to 5 August was different in its extent. “This event is a pretty big one going all the way to west of Kap Morris Jesup. This is unusual,” he said.  As well as reducing ice cover, the ocean intrusion raises concerns of feedbacks, which could tip the Earth towards a hothouse state.  Freakish Arctic temperatures have alarmed climate scientists since the beginning of the year. During the sunless winter, a heatwave raised concerns that the polar vortex may be eroding.  This includes the Gulf Stream, which is at its weakest level in 1,600 years due to melting Greenland ice and ocean warming. With lower circulation of water and air, weather systems tend to linger longer.  A dormant hot front has been blamed for record temperatures in Lapland and forest fires in Siberia, much of Scandinavia and elsewhere in the Arctic circle.

9d0cdfe6	Share this Story: Polar bears keep thriving even as global warming alarmists keep pretending they’re dying  Polar bears keep thriving even as global warming alarmists keep pretending they’re dying Susan Crockford: Polar bears are flourishing, making them phony icons, and false idols, for global warming alarmists Photo by Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press  Article content One powerful polar bear fact is slowly rising above the message of looming catastrophe repeated endlessly by the media: More than 15,000 polar bears have not disappeared since 2005. Although the extent of the summer sea ice after 2006 dropped abruptly to levels not expected until 2050, the predicted 67-per-cent decline in polar bear numbers simply didn’t happen. Rather, global polar bear numbers have been stable or slightly improved. The polar bear’s resilience should have meant the end of its use as a cherished icon of global warming doom, but it didn’t. The alarmism is not going away without a struggle. Part of this struggle involves a scientific clash about transparency in polar bear science. My close examination of recent research has revealed that serious inconsistencies exist within the polar bear literature and between that literature and public statements made by some researchers. For example, Canadian polar bear biologist Ian Stirling learned in the 1970s that spring sea ice in the southern Beaufort Sea periodically gets so thick that seals depart, depriving local polar bears of their prey and causing their numbers to plummet. But that fact, documented in more than a dozen scientific papers, is not discussed today as part of polar bear ecology. In these days of politicized science, neither Stirling nor his colleagues mention in public the devastating effects of thick spring ice in the Beaufort Sea; instead, they imply in recent papers that the starving bears they witnessed are victims of reduced summer sea ice, which they argued depleted the bears’ prey. There are also strong indications that thick spring-ice conditions happened again in 2014–16, with the impacts on polar bears being similarly portrayed as effects of global warming.

Article content The polar bear's resilience should have meant the end of its use as an icon of global warming doom One reason that the 2007 predictions of future polar bear survival were so far off base is that the model developed by American biologist Steven Amstrup (now at Polar Bears International, an NGO) assumed any polar bear population decline would be caused by less summer ice, despite the Beaufort Sea experience. Moreover, Amstrup and fellow modelers were overly confident in their claim that summer ice was critical for the polar bear’s survival and they had little data on which to base their assumption that less summer ice would devastate the polar bears’ prey. Consequently, many scientists were surprised when other researchers subsequently found that ringed and bearded seals (the primary prey of polar bears) north of the Bering Strait especially thrived with a longer open-water season, which is particularly conducive to fishing: These seals do most of their feeding in summer. More food for seals in summer means more fat seal pups for polar bears to eat the following spring, a result that’s probably true throughout the Arctic. As long as polar bears have lots of baby seals to eat in spring, they get fat enough to survive even a longer-than-usual summer fast. And while it’s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s, there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice. Not all bears get enough to eat in the spring, of course. Starvation has always been the leading natural cause of death for polar bears, due to a number of factors including competition, injury, tooth decay and illness. Some cancers induce a muscle-wasting syndrome that leads to faster-than-usual weight loss. This is likely what happened to the emaciated Baffin Island bear captured on video in July 2017 and promoted by National Geographic late last year. The videographers claimed it showed what starvation due to sea-ice loss looked like — an implausible conclusion given the time of year, the isolated nature of the incident, and the fact that sea ice that year was no more reduced than previously.  Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.  Article content That starving-bear video may have convinced a few more gullible people that only hundreds of polar bears are left in the world. But it also motivated others to locate the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List report for 2015 that estimated global polar bear numbers at somewhere between 22,000-31,000, or about 26,000, up slightly from 20,000-25,000, or about 22,500, in 2005. Newer counts not included in the 2015 assessment potentially add another 2,500 or so to the total. This increase may not be statistically significant, but it is decidedly not the 67-per-cent decline that was predicted given the ice conditions that prevailed. The failure of the 2007 polar bear survival model is a simple fact that explodes the myth that polar bears are on their way to extinction. Although starving-bear videos and scientifically insignificant research papers still make the news, they don’t alter the facts: Polar bears are thriving, making them phony icons, and false idols, for global warming alarmists.

bae4220d	"(CNN) Governments around the world must take ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"" to avoid disastrous levels of global warming , says a stark new report from the global scientific authority on climate change .  The report issued Monday by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), says the planet will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030, precipitating the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people.  The date, which falls well within the lifetime of many people alive today, is based on current levels of greenhouse gas emissions.  The planet is already two-thirds of the way there, with global temperatures having warmed about 1 degree C . Avoiding going even higher will require significant action in the next few years.  ""This is concerning because we know there are so many more problems if we exceed 1.5 degrees C global warming, including more heatwaves and hot summers, greater sea level rise, and, for many parts of the world, worse droughts and rainfall extremes,"" Andrew King, a lecturer in climate science at the University of Melbourne, said in a statement.  Global net emissions of carbon dioxide would need to fall by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach ""net zero"" around 2050 in order to keep the warming around 1.5 degrees C.  Lowering emissions to this degree, while technically possible, would require widespread changes in energy, industry, buildings, transportation and cities, the report says.  ""The window on keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C is closing rapidly and the current emissions pledges made by signatories to the Paris Agreement do not add up to us achieving that goal,"" added King.  Sea ice is seen from NASA's Operation IceBridge research aircraft off the northwest coast of Greenland. Scientists say the Arctic has been one of the regions hardest hit by climate change.  Consequences of past inaction  The report makes it clear that climate change is already happening -- and what comes next could be even worse, unless urgent international political action is taken.  ""One of the key messages that comes out very strongly from this report is that we are already seeing the consequences of 1 degree C of global warming through more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice, among other changes,"" said Panmao Zhai, co-chair of IPCC Working Group I.  Even if warming is kept at or just below 1.5 degrees C, the impacts will be widespread and significant.  Temperatures during summer heatwaves, such as those just experienced across Europe this summer, can be expected to increase by 3 degrees C says the report.  Coral reefs will also be drastically affected, with between 70 and 90% expected to die off, including Australia's Great Barrier Reef.  Countries in the southern hemisphere will be among the worse off, the report said, ""projected to experience the largest impacts on economic growth due to climate change should global warming increase.""  The report underlines how even the smallest increase in the base target would worsen the impact of recent natural disasters.  ""Every extra bit of warming matters, especially since warming of 1.5 degrees C or higher increases the risk associated with long-lasting or irreversible changes, such as the loss of some ecosystems,"" said Hans-Otto Pörtner, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group II.  The report cites specific examples of how impacts of global warming would be lessened with the 1.5 degrees C increase, compared to the 2 degrees C increase:  Global sea levels would rise 10 cm lower by 2100.  The likelihood of an Arctic Ocean free of sea ice in summer would be once per century, instead of at least once per decade.  Coral reefs would decline by 70% to 90% instead of being almost completely wiped out.  This chart from the IPCC shows how global temperatures would respond to a sudden and drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Even with immediate action, global temps will still overshoot the goal, but could reduce back to the target over time.  'Possible with the laws of chemistry and physics'  Monday's report is three years in the making and is a direct result of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement . In the Paris accord, 197 countries agreed to the goal of holding global temperatures ""well below"" 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees C.  The United States was initially in the agreement, but President Donald Trump pulled the country out a year and half later, claiming it was unfair to the country.  To limit global warming to 1.5 degree C is ""possible within the laws of chemistry and physics,"" said Jim Skea, co-chair of IPCC Working Group III. ""But doing so would require unprecedented changes.""  ""International cooperation is absolutely imperative to limit emissions and therefore global warming and its impacts, as well as coordinating effective and widespread adaptation and mitigation,"" said Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a fellow at the Climate Change Research Center at the University of New South Wales. ""The next few years will be critical in the evolution of these efforts.""  One key issue will be negative emissions, large scale carbon-scrubbing technologies that can reduce the amount in the atmosphere and act to counter continued pollution.  According to the report, there are two main ways of removing carbon from the atmosphere: increasing natural processes that already do this, and experimental carbon storage or removal technologies.  However, all methods ""are at different stages of development and some are more conceptual than others, as they have not been tested at scale,"" the report warned.  They will also require considerable political engagement globally, as will reducing the amount of carbon being emitted. Despite the report's dire warnings, there is no indication such cooperation will be doable, particularly given the Trump administration's stance on this issue.  ""Today the world's leading scientific experts collectively reinforced what mother nature has made clear -- that we need to undergo an urgent and rapid transformation to a global clean energy economy,"" former US Vice President Al Gore said.  ""Unfortunately, the Trump administration has become a rogue outlier in its shortsighted attempt to prop up the dirty fossil fuel industries of the past. The administration is in direct conflict with American businesses, states, cities and citizens leading the transformation."""	Planet has only until 2030 to stem catastrophic climate change, experts warn	true
65ebf51e	"The average concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere topped 411 parts per million in May.  In April — the previous month — the concentration hit 410 ppm for the first time in recorded history.  These are the highest CO2 levels in the 800,000 years for which we have good data.  This is expected to have a catastrophic effect on human health and the planet.  We have a pretty good idea of what Earth's atmosphere has looked like for the past 800,000 years.  Humans like us — Homo sapiens — evolved about 200,000 years ago, but ice-core records reveal intricate details of our planet's history from long before humans existed. By drilling more than 3 kilometers deep into the ice sheets over Greenland and Antarctica, scientists can see how temperature and atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels have changed.  From that record, we know the atmosphere and the air that we breathe has never had as much carbon dioxide in it as it does today.  For the first time in recorded history, the average monthly level of CO2 in the atmosphere exceeded 410 parts per million in April, according to observations at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. In May, that number climbed above 411 ppm, according to researchers from Scripps Institute of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The record is not a coincidence — humans have rapidly transformed the air we breathe by pumping CO2 into it over the past two centuries. In recent years, we've pushed those gas levels into uncharted territory.  That change has inevitable and scary consequences. Research indicates that if unchecked, increased CO2 levels could cause pollution-related deaths to increase by tens of thousands, and lead to the slowing of human cognition (especially when you take into account the fact that CO2 levels tend to be higher indoors in cities). Carbon dioxide also contributes to warming that causes sea-level rise, searing heat waves, and superstorms.  ""As a scientist, what concerns me the most is what this continued rise actually means: that we are continuing full speed ahead with an unprecedented experiment with our planet, the only home we have,"" Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist, said on Twitter.  Vast glaciers in West Antarctica seem to be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may push up sea levels for centuries. NASA  Breathing the air of a new world  For the 800,000 years for which we have records, average global CO2 levels fluctuated between about 170 ppm and 280 ppm. Once humans started to burn fossil fuels in the industrial era, things changed rapidly.  Only in the industrial era has the number risen above 300 ppm. The concentration first crept above 400 ppm in 2013, and it continues to climb.  There's a debate among scientists about the last time CO2 levels were this high. It might have been during the Pliocene era, 2 million to 4.6 million years ago, when sea levels were 60 to 80 feet higher than today. Or it may have been in the Miocene, 10 million to 14 million years ago, when seas were more than 100 feet higher than now.  In our 800,000-year record, it took about 1,000 years for CO2 levels to increase by 35 ppm. We're currently averaging an increase of more than 2 ppm a year, meaning we could hit an average of 500 ppm within the next 45 years.  CO2 doesn't directly harm human health at these concentrations. But because it traps heat on the planet that then cranks up the global thermostat, it can have a very significant effect on health.  Global temperature tracks very closely to atmospheric levels of CO2. The potential effects of higher average temperatures include tens of thousands of deaths from heat waves, more extreme weather events, and the spread of diseases carried by ticks and mosquitoes — something we're already seeing. (There's a full list of possible ways climate change will affect human health on an archived Environmental Protection Agency page.)  Global annual temperature and CO2 levels, 1959 to 2016  Higher levels of CO2 and the warming they cause also exacerbate ozone pollution. One 2008 study found that for every degree Celsius the temperature rises because of CO2 levels, ozone pollution can be expected to kill an additional 22,000 people via respiratory illness, asthma, and emphysema.  Humans have never had to breathe air that's this polluted. Increased air pollution has been shown to cause lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and higher rates of allergies and asthma. A recent study found that 9 million people died prematurely from pollution-related diseases in 2015, accounting for 16% of all deaths worldwide.  Other research has raised even more concerns. The average CO2 level doesn't represent the air most of us breathe. Cities tend to have far more CO2 than average — and those levels rise even higher indoors. Some research indicates that it may have a negative effect on human cognition and decision-making.  For these reasons, President Barack Obama's EPA ruled in 2009 that CO2 was a pollutant that needed to be regulated under the Clean Air Act. But the Trump administration is reevaluating that ruling.  Pedestrians crossing a road on a smoggy day in Nanjing, China. Thomson Reuters  Drowning in CO2  The human-health effects of CO2 increases are just one part of the bigger story here.  The change we've seen in CO2 levels recently has been much more rapid than the historical trends. Some experts think we're on track to hit 550 ppm by the end of the century, which could cause average global temperatures to rise by 6 degrees Celsius. For context, the increase in superstorms, rising sea levels, and spreading tick-borne disease that we're already seeing comes after a 0.9-degree rise.  Data from Parrenin et al., 2013; Snyder et al., 2016; Bereiter et al., 2015. Ben Henley and Nerilie Abram/The Conversation  Projections of sea-level rise will also get more extreme as CO2 levels continue to climb.  Right now, carbon-dioxide emissions are still rising. The goal set in the Paris agreement on climate change is to limit the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius or less. But as a recent feature in the journal Nature revealed, we're on track for more than 3 degrees of warming.  The latest measurements show that if we want to avoid that dangerous scenario, we need to make dramatic changes very quickly.  This story was updated on June 12 to include the newly released data on CO2 levels hitting a new record in May and to clarify the means through which higher levels of CO2 affect human health."

Try refreshing your browser, or Ross McKitrick: This scientist proved climate change isn’t causing extreme weather — so politicians attacked Back to video While members of the media may nod along to such claims, the evidence paints a different story. Roger Pielke Jr. is a scientist at University of Colorado in Boulder who, up until a few years ago, did world-leading research on climate change and extreme weather. He found convincing evidence that climate change was not leading to higher rates of weather-related damages worldwide, once you correct for increasing population and wealth. He also helped convene major academic panels to survey the evidence and communicate the near-unanimous scientific consensus on this topic to policymakers. For his efforts, Pielke was subjected to a vicious, well-funded smear campaign backed by, among others, the Obama White House and leading Democratic congressmen, culminating in his decision in 2015 to quit the field.

Article content In 2012, the IPCC Special Report on Extreme Weather came out and echoed the Hohenkammer Consensus, concluding that once you adjust for population growth and economic changes, there is no statistical connection between climate change and measures of weather-related damages. In 2013 Pielke testified to the United States Congress and relayed the IPCC findings. Shortly thereafter, Obama’s science advisor John Holdren accused him of misleading Congress and launched a lengthy but ill-informed attack on Pielke, which prompted congressional Democrats to open an investigation into Pielke’s sources of funding (which quickly fizzled amid benign conclusions). Meanwhile heavily funded left-wing groups succeeded in getting him fired from a popular internet news platform. In 2015 Pielke quit the climate field. So where did the science end up? In the second half of his talk, Pielke reviews the science as found in the most recent (2013) IPCC Assessment Report, the 2018 U.S. National Climate Assessment, and the most up-to-date scientific data and literature. Nothing substantial has changed. Globally there’s no clear evidence of trends and patterns in extreme events such as droughts, hurricanes and floods. Some regions experience more, some less and some no trend. Limitations of data and inconsistencies in patterns prevent confident claims about global trends one way or another. There’s no trend in U.S. hurricane landfall frequency or intensity. If anything, the past 50 years has been relatively quiet. There’s no trend in hurricane-related flooding in the U.S. Nor is there evidence of an increase in floods globally. Since 1965, more parts of the U.S. have seen a decrease in flooding than have seen an increase. And from 1940 to today, flood damage as a percentage of GDP has fallen to less than 0.05 per cent per year from about 0.2 per cent.  Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.  Article content And on it goes. There’s no trend in U.S. tornado damage (in fact, 2012 to 2017 was below average). There’s no trend in global droughts. Cold snaps in the U.S. are down but, unexpectedly, so are heatwaves. The bottom line is there’s no solid connection between climate change and many major indicators of extreme weather that politicians keep talking about, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, rainfall and floods, despite Trudeau’s claims to the contrary. The continual claim of such links is misinformation employed for political and rhetorical purposes. Powerful people get away with it because so few people know what the numbers show. Many scientists who know better remain silent. And the few who push back against the propaganda, such as Roger Pielke Jr., find themselves on the receiving end of abuse and career-threatening attacks, even though they have all the science in their corner. Something has gotten scary and extreme, but it isn’t the weather. • Ross McKitrick is a professor of economics at the University of Guelph and senior fellow of the Fraser Institute.

2bbc1c1a	Scientists say they have found evidence that frozen methane deposits in the Arctic Ocean have started to be released over a large area of the continental slope off the East Siberian coast, the Guardian can reveal.  High levels of the potent greenhouse gas have been detected down to a depth of 350 metres in the Laptev Sea near Russia, prompting concern among researchers that the discovery could have “serious climate consequences”.  The slope sediments in the Arctic contain a huge quantity of frozen methane and other gases – known as hydrates. Methane has a warming effect 80 times stronger than carbon dioxide over 20 years. The United States Geological Survey has previously listed Arctic hydrate destabilisation as one of four most serious scenarios for abrupt climate change.  The international team onboard the Russian research ship R/V Akademik Keldysh said most of the bubbles were currently dissolving in the water but methane levels at the surface were four to eight times what would normally be expected and this was venting into the atmosphere.  “At this moment, there is unlikely to be any major impact on global warming, but the point is that this process has now been triggered. This East Siberian slope methane hydrate system has been perturbed and the process will be ongoing,” said the Swedish scientist Örjan Gustafsson, of Stockholm University, in a satellite call from the vessel.  Quick Guide Methane and the Arctic Show Why are methane hydrates considered 'sleeping giants' for the climate? Scientists estimate 1,400 gigatonnes of carbon are locked up in subsea hydrates (frozen methane and other gases) under Arctic submarine permafrost, some of which could be vulnerable to global heating. If large volumes were released, this could rapidly destabilise the climate because methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a warming effect 80 times stronger than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. Such concerns led the United States Geological Survey to list Arctic hydrate destabilisation as one of four most serious scenarios for abrupt climate change. This possibility – sometimes referred to as the 'clathrate gun hypothesis' – has been the basis for doomsday scenarios of runaway warming that tips the Earth towards a hothouse state. However, several studies suggest such fears are exaggerated.    That sounds scary. When could it happen? There are many uncertainties: at what temperature will hydrates destabilise and, if they do, how fast will it happen; and will the gas bubbles reach the surface and be released into the atmosphere or simply dissolve in the oceans? These and other questions are now the subject of intense research on the shelf and slopes of the Laptev Sea and other areas of the Arctic.    The scientists – who are part of a multi-year International Shelf Study Expedition – stressed their findings were preliminary. Methane seeps detected in the past were found to be historic, but the expedition believes these are new based on an earlier study showing movement of the subsea permafrost between the early 1980s and 2015. The scale of methane releases will not be confirmed until they return, analyse the data and have their studies published in a peer-reviewed journal.  But the discovery of potentially destabilised slope frozen methane raises concerns about the potential impact on the speed of global heating.  The Arctic is considered ground zero in the debate about the vulnerability of frozen methane deposits – which have been called the “sleeping giants of the carbon cycle” - in the ocean, and if releases were to exceed a tipping point it could increase the speed of global heating.  With the Arctic temperature now rising more than twice as fast as the global average, the question of when – or even whether – they will be released into the atmosphere has been a matter of considerable uncertainty in climate computer models.  The 60-member team on the Akademik Keldysh believe they are the first to observationally confirm the methane release is already under way across a wide area of the slope about 600km offshore.  Scientists at work on the test cruise Electra 1, prior to the Akademik Keldysh expedition. Photograph: ISSS2020  At six monitoring points over a slope area 150km in length and 10km wide, they saw clouds of bubbles released from sediment.  At one location on the Laptev Sea slope at a depth of about 300 metres they found methane concentrations of up to 1,600 nanomoles per litre, which is 400 times higher than would be expected if the sea and the atmosphere were in equilibrium.  Igor Semiletov, of the Russian Academy of Sciences, who is the chief scientist onboard, said the discharges were “significantly larger” than anything found before. “The discovery of actively releasing shelf slope hydrates is very important and unknown until now,” he said. “This is a new page. Potentially they can have serious climate consequences, but we need more study before we can confirm that.”  The most likely cause of the instability is an intrusion of warm Atlantic currents into the east Arctic. This “Atlantification” is driven by human-induced climate disruption.  The latest discovery potentially marks the third source of methane emissions from the region. Semiletov, who has been studying this area for two decades, has previously reported the gas is being released from the shelf of the Arctic – the biggest of any sea.  For the second year in a row, his team have found crater-like pockmarks in the shallower parts of the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea that are discharging bubble jets of methane, which is reaching the sea surface at levels tens to hundreds of times higher than normal. This is similar to the craters and sinkholes reported from inland Siberian tundra earlier this autumn.  Temperatures in Siberia were 5C higher than average from January to June this year, an anomaly that was made at least 600 times more likely by human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide and methane. Last winter’s sea ice melted unusually early. This winter’s freeze has yet to begin, already a later start than at any time on record.

23ff9e71	Avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet, according to the scientists behind the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet.  The new research shows that without meat and dairy consumption, global farmland use could be reduced by more than 75% – an area equivalent to the US, China, European Union and Australia combined – and still feed the world. Loss of wild areas to agriculture is the leading cause of the current mass extinction of wildlife.  The new analysis shows that while meat and dairy provide just 18% of calories and 37% of protein, it uses the vast majority – 83% – of farmland and produces 60% of agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions. Other recent research shows 86% of all land mammals are now livestock or humans. The scientists also found that even the very lowest impact meat and dairy products still cause much more environmental harm than the least sustainable vegetable and cereal growing.  The study, published in the journal Science, created a huge dataset based on almost 40,000 farms in 119 countries and covering 40 food products that represent 90% of all that is eaten. It assessed the full impact of these foods, from farm to fork, on land use, climate change emissions, freshwater use and water pollution (eutrophication) and air pollution (acidification).  “A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use,” said Joseph Poore, at the University of Oxford, UK, who led the research. “It is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car,” he said, as these only cut greenhouse gas emissions.  “Agriculture is a sector that spans all the multitude of environmental problems,” he said. “Really it is animal products that are responsible for so much of this. Avoiding consumption of animal products delivers far better environmental benefits than trying to purchase sustainable meat and dairy.”  The analysis also revealed a huge variability between different ways of producing the same food. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land result in 12 times more greenhouse gases and use 50 times more land than those grazing rich natural pasture. But the comparison of beef with plant protein such as peas is stark, with even the lowest impact beef responsible for six times more greenhouse gases and 36 times more land.  The large variability in environmental impact from different farms does present an opportunity for reducing the harm, Poore said, without needing the global population to become vegan. If the most harmful half of meat and dairy production was replaced by plant-based food, this still delivers about two-thirds of the benefits of getting rid of all meat and dairy production.  Cutting the environmental impact of farming is not easy, Poore warned: “There are over 570m farms all of which need slightly different ways to reduce their impact. It is an [environmental] challenge like no other sector of the economy.” But he said at least $500bn is spent every year on agricultural subsidies, and probably much more: “There is a lot of money there to do something really good with.”  Labels that reveal the impact of products would be a good start, so consumers could choose the least damaging options, he said, but subsidies for sustainable and healthy foods and taxes on meat and dairy will probably also be necessary.  One surprise from the work was the large impact of freshwater fish farming, which provides two-thirds of such fish in Asia and 96% in Europe, and was thought to be relatively environmentally friendly. “You get all these fish depositing excreta and unconsumed feed down to the bottom of the pond, where there is barely any oxygen, making it the perfect environment for methane production,” a potent greenhouse gas, Poore said.  The research also found grass-fed beef, thought to be relatively low impact, was still responsible for much higher impacts than plant-based food. “Converting grass into [meat] is like converting coal to energy. It comes with an immense cost in emissions,” Poore said.  The new research has received strong praise from other food experts. Prof Gidon Eshel, at Bard College, US, said: “I was awestruck. It is really important, sound, ambitious, revealing and beautifully done.”  He said previous work on quantifying farming’s impacts, including his own, had taken a top-down approach using national level data, but the new work used a bottom-up approach, with farm-by-farm data. “It is very reassuring to see they yield essentially the same results. But the new work has very many important details that are profoundly revealing.”  Prof Tim Benton, at the University of Leeds, UK, said: “This is an immensely useful study. It brings together a huge amount of data and that makes its conclusions much more robust. The way we produce food, consume and waste food is unsustainable from a planetary perspective. Given the global obesity crisis, changing diets – eating less livestock produce and more vegetables and fruit – has the potential to make both us and the planet healthier.”  Dr Peter Alexander, at the University of Edinburgh, UK, was also impressed but noted: “There may be environmental benefits, eg for biodiversity, from sustainably managed grazing and increasing animal product consumption may improve nutrition for some of the poorest globally. My personal opinion is we should interpret these results not as the need to become vegan overnight, but rather to moderate our [meat] consumption.”  Poore said: “The reason I started this project was to understand if there were sustainable animal producers out there. But I have stopped consuming animal products over the last four years of this project. These impacts are not necessary to sustain our current way of life. The question is how much can we reduce them and the answer is a lot.”	Avoiding meat and dairy is ‘single biggest way’ to reduce your impact on Earth	partially false
fb4fbda8	Ted Cruz represents Texas in the United States Senate. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.  (CNN) Following a successful international tour and the G-7 Summit in Italy, President Trump has an opportunity to relieve our nation of the unfair and economically devastating requirements of the Paris Agreement, the United Nations climate treaty he pledged to rip up during the campaign.  And as soon as possible , President Trump should act on -- and keep -- his campaign promise.  The agreement, signed by the Obama administration last year, would commit the United States to drastically reducing its carbon emissions while allowing some countries to increase theirs. This, all while doing nothing to meaningfully decrease global temperatures.  According to a recent National Economic Research Associates Economic Consulting study, the Paris Agreement could obliterate $3 trillion of GDP, 6.5 million industrial sector jobs and $7,000 in per capita household income from the American economy by 2040. Meeting the 2025 emissions reduction target alone could subtract $250 billion from our GDP and eliminate 2.7 million jobs. The cement, iron and steel, and petroleum refining industries could see their production cut by 21% 19%, and 11% respectively.  Not only would these unfair standards reduce American job growth and wages and increase monthly utility costs for hardworking families, they would fundamentally disadvantage the United States in the global economy. The result: our economic output would lag while other countries continued to expand their GDPs.  The agreement's proponents market it as a panacea for addressing the impacts of climate change, but at its core, it is about increasing government control -- over the economy, the energy sector and nearly every aspect of our daily lives. It represents the exact misguided, top-down, government-knows-best approach that American voters resoundingly rejected in 2016.  We cannot pursue a path that puts American workers first if we cripple a fossil fuel energy sector that generates 82% of the energy consumed in the United States. The coal industry alone supplies almost one-third of America's electric power -- with an increasing amount of clean coal-burning technology becoming available.  America is poised to become a net energy exporter over the next decade. We should not abandon that progress at the cost of weakening our energy renaissance and crippling economic growth.  And let's not forget the massive utility cost increases the agreement would entail. The Clean Power Plan, a major component of fulfilling the agreement, would spike energy costs for working and middle-class Texans by 16% by 2030 , according to the Economic Reliability Council of Texas, the entity that operates the electric grid for much of our state.  We simply cannot afford an agreement that puts thousands of Americans out of work, increases their energy costs and devastates our core industries.  In return for crippling our economy, the Paris Agreement would do next to nothing to impact global temperatures. Under the EPA's own models, if all carbon emissions in America were basically eliminated, global temperatures would only decrease by less than two-tenths of a degree Celsius.  While the agreement would have a negligible impact on temperatures, America would be putting itself at a competitive disadvantage. That's because while the Obama administration irresponsibly committed America to immediate, real cuts in emissions, our global economic competitors would have no such handicap. In fact, Russia is permitted to increase its emissions approximately 50% and China and India have no meaningful cap on emissions until 2030.  This disparity among the countries' pledges inflicts real losses on our economy now while our rivals continue to grow, industrialize and diversify at their own pace with no implementation costs. In the meantime, the agreement would force American taxpayers to subsidize alternative energy at the expense of clean coal, nuclear power and natural gas -- energy resources that actually work for our economy and our environment.  The Paris Agreement would also handicap America in the global race for new sources of energy. Russia has committed financial and military assets to the Arctic to stake its claim to the region's vast deepwater mineral, oil and gas deposits. China is also exploring and trading for Arctic oil and gas. Meanwhile, American liquefied natural gas struggles with logistical costs that weaken its competitiveness.  By allowing our rivals to increase their cooperation and strategic leverage around the world -- pressuring our allies and partners, harming domestic job creators and materially reducing our prestige and influence in the process --- the agreement would damage America's national security as much as our economic security. The emission cuts that the US would have to make today, and the resultant costs for our own energy firms, would weaken our ability to battle our rivals on an equal footing in the drive for untapped energy sources.  Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook  Efforts to unwind some of the deal's more onerous regulations are welcomed, but that is not enough. Unless the US completely withdraws, the Paris Agreement will continue to cause sustained harm to our security and economy, and it keeps the door open for future administrations to use it as means to impose more costly and ineffective energy regulations.  We should not let a deal subject to the whims of future administrations or Congresses hang like a wet blanket over our economy -- driving up energy prices, devastating our industrial base and bolstering our rivals.  I hope President Trump will take the opportunity before him to fulfill the commitment he made and withdraw America from the Paris Agreement.

caa34051	A domino-like cascade of melting ice, warming seas, shifting currents and dying forests could tilt the Earth into a “hothouse” state beyond which human efforts to reduce emissions will be increasingly futile, a group of leading climate scientists has warned.  This grim prospect is sketched out in a journal paper that considers the combined consequences of 10 climate change processes, including the release of methane trapped in Siberian permafrost and the impact of melting ice in Greenland on the Antarctic.  The authors of the essay, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, stress their analysis is not conclusive, but warn the Paris commitment to keep warming at 2C above pre-industrial levels may not be enough to “park” the planet’s climate at a stable temperature.  They warn that the hothouse trajectory “would almost certainly flood deltaic environments, increase the risk of damage from coastal storms, and eliminate coral reefs (and all of the benefits that they provide for societies) by the end of this century or earlier.”  Fifty years ago, this would be dismissed as alarmist, but now scientists have become really worried Johan Rockström, executive ​director, Stockholm Resilience Centre  “I do hope we are wrong, but as scientists we have a responsibility to explore whether this is real,” said Johan Rockström, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre. “We need to know now. It’s so urgent. This is one of the most existential questions in science.”  Rockström and his co-authors are among the world’s leading authorities on positive feedback loops, by which warming temperatures release new sources of greenhouse gases or destroy the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon or reflect heat.  Their new paper asks whether the planet’s temperature can stabilise at 2C or whether it will gravitate towards a more extreme state. The authors attempt to assess whether warming can be halted or whether it will tip towards a “hothouse” world that is 4C warmer than pre-industrial times and far less supportive of human life.  Katherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen, one of the authors, said the paper showed that climate action was not just a case of turning the knob on emissions, but of understanding how various factors interact at a global level.  “We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will ‘want’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions,” she said. “This implies not only reducing emissions but much more.”  New feedback loops are still being discovered. A separate paper published in PNAS reveals that increased rainfall – a symptom of climate change in some regions - is making it harder for forest soils to trap greenhouse gases such as methane.    Previous studies have shown that weakening carbon sinks will add 0.25C, forest dieback will add 0.11C, permafrost thaw will add 0.9C and increased bacterial respiration will add 0.02C. The authors of the new paper also look at the loss of methane hydrates from the ocean floor and the reduction of snow and ice cover at the poles.  Rockström says there are huge gaps in data and knowledge about how one process might amplify another. Contrary to the Gaia theory, which suggests the Earth has a self-righting tendency, he says the feedbacks could push the planet to a more extreme state.  As an example, the authors say the loss of Greenland ice could disrupt the Gulf Stream ocean current, which would raise sea levels and accumulate heat in the Southern Ocean, which would in turn accelerate ice loss from the east Antarctic. Concerns about this possibility were heightened earlier this year by reports that the Gulf Stream was at its weakest level in 1,600 years.  Currently, global average temperatures are just over 1C above pre-industrial levels and rising at 0.17C per decade. The Paris climate agreement set actions to keep warming limited to 1.5C-2C by the end of the century, but the authors warn more drastic action may be necessary.  “The heatwave we now have in Europe is not something that was expected with just 1C of warming,” Rockström said. “Several positive feedback loops are already in operation, but they are still weak. We need studies to show when they might cause a runaway effect.  Another climate scientist – who was not involved in the paper – emphasised the document aimed to raise questions rather than prove a theory. “It’s rather selective, but not outlandish,” said Prof Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute. “Threshold and tipping points have been discussed previously, but to state that 2C is a threshold we can’t pull back from is new, I think. I’m not sure what ‘evidence’ there is for this – or indeed whether there can be until we experience it.”  Rockström said the question needed asking. “We could end up delivering the Paris agreement and keep to 2C of warming, but then face an ugly surprise if the system starts to slip away,” he said. “We don’t say this will definitely happen. We just list all the disruptive events and come up with plausible occurrences … 50 years ago, this would be dismissed as alarmist, but now scientists have become really worried.”  “In the context of the summer of 2018, this is definitely not a case of crying wolf, raising a false alarm: the wolves are now in sight,” said Dr Phil Williamson, a climate researcher at the University of East Anglia. “The authors argue that we need to be much more proactive in that regard, not just ending greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as possible, but also building resilience in the context of complex Earth system processes that we might not fully understand until it is too late.”	Domino-effect of climate events could move Earth into a ‘hothouse’ state	partially false
e122d505	Extremely hot days, when temperatures soar to 95 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, can be miserable. Crops wilt in the fields. Electric grids strain to keep pace with demand. People are at greater risk of dying. And those hot temperatures are expected to be much more frequent in the coming decades.  Global warming under Paris pledges  Global warming under Paris pledges  Days per year above 95°F 5 50 100 200  The map above, based on a new analysis from the Climate Impact Lab, shows how 95-degree days (35 degrees Celsius) are expected to multiply this century if countries take moderate climate action. In this scenario, countries would take some measures, but not drastic ones, to curb emissions — roughly the trajectory of the current pledges under the Paris climate agreement.  The resulting global warming would still cause significant shifts for many cities. In Washington, from 1986 to 2005, an average of seven days each year had temperatures of at least 95 degrees. By the end of the century, the city can expect 29 of these extremely hot days per year, on average. (The likely range is 14 to 46 hot days per year.)  Phoenix is used to the heat, averaging 124 days per year with 95-degree weather. At the end of the century, that’s expected to increase to around 155 days — an extra month of extreme temperatures each year. Madrid would go from eight severely hot days per year to 43, Beijing from nine to 35.  The swings are even greater closer to the equator. New Delhi, India’s capital city, has historically averaged 105 days with temperatures of at least 95 degrees each year. That’s likely to rise to a range of 137 to 200 days per year.  Things could get worse if countries fail to take action  If the world’s nations took no action on global warming, and emissions continued to rise at the same pace they did in the first decade of this century — with total global warming of 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit or more by the end of the century — extremely hot days would become much more commonplace.  Global warming if no action is taken  Global warming if no action is taken  Days per year above 95°F 5 50 100 200  By 2100, Washington could swelter in 95-degree weather for fully one-fifth of the year — around 74 days, on average. Large swaths of Brazil and sub-Saharan Africa would experience these temperatures for most of the year.  This worst case for global warming now appears less likely as global coal use declines and nations slowly move toward cleaner energy.  How 95-degree days disrupt our everyday lives  In the United States, electricity use soars as temperatures rise and more households use air-conditioning more frequently. One recent study found that the United States’ electric grid would have to handle a 7.2 percent increase in peak demand this century under a moderate warming scenario.  As temperature increases: Electricity consumption spikes. And crop yields plunge. Change in monthly California electricity usage relative to a 65°F day, 1999 to 2009.

In countries without widespread cooling, heat deaths rise more sharply during the hottest days. One study estimated that heat deaths in India increase by 3.2 percent for every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit above 68 (or every 1 degree Celsius above 20). Energy use in many countries may rise sharply as people struggle to adapt to a hotter climate.  Other scientists have found that corn and soybean yields in the United States plummet precipitously when temperatures rise above 84 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius), and that worker productivity declines sharply, particularly for outdoor jobs. And researchers are trying to understand how crime and conflict might rise as temperatures increase.  Ultimately, people will be better able to adapt if they have a better idea of what individual cities and regions can expect, said Trevor Houser, who co-directs the Climate Impact Lab. In the United States, some urban planners are already experimenting with techniques like adding green spaces or increasing the reflectivity of rooftops to cool down city centers during heat waves.  “Right now, when you start talking to people about higher temperatures, they tend to think, great, more beach days,” said Solomon Hsiang, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley who helps direct the lab. “What’s often less appreciated is just how much an extremely hot day can distort our lives in all sorts of ways we don’t often even think about.”	95-Degree Days: How Extreme Heat Could Spread Across the World	true
4ebbbb28	Global warming skeptics sometimes say rising temperatures are just another naturally occurring shift in Earth’s climate, like the Medieval Warm Period of the years 800 to 1200 or the Little Ice Age, a period of cooling that spanned from roughly 1300 to 1850.  But a pair of studies published Wednesday provides stark evidence that the rise in global temperatures over the past 150 years has been far more rapid and widespread than any warming period in the past 2,000 years — a finding that undercuts claims that today’s global warming isn’t necessarily the result of human activity.  “The familiar maxim that the climate is always changing is certainly true,” Scott St. George, a physical geographer at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, said in a written commentary about the studies. “But even when we push our perspective to the earliest days of the Roman Empire, we cannot discern any event that is remotely equivalent — either in degree or extent — to the warming over the last few decades.”  Since the beginning of the 20th century, the global average temperature on Earth has risen by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. A consensus of climate scientists pins the increase primarily on the burning of fossil fuels, which spews carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the air. In the absence of concerted efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the United Nations says, the global average temperature could rise an additional 5.4 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.  One of the studies, published in the journal Nature, shows that the Little Ice Age and other natural fluctuations affected only limited regions of the planet at a time, making modern warming the first and only planetwide warm period in the past two millennia. The other study, published in Nature Geoscience, shows that the rate of modern warming has far outpaced changes that occurred before the rise of the industrial era.  For the research, a team led by Raphael Neukom, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bern’s Institute of Geography in Switzerland, analyzed 2,000 years' worth of climate data. In the absence of direct temperature information — thermometer measurements were scarce before the middle of the 19th century — the scientists looked at data on old trees’ growth rings, layers of glacier ice and the remnants of corals, whose layers have different chemical compositions depending on the temperature of seawater.  The Nature study mapped the temperature fluctuations across the planet, finding, for example, that the Little Ice Age didn’t affect the whole world at once. Temperatures bottomed out in the Pacific Ocean around 1500, the scientists found; Europe and North America didn’t fully chill out for another two centuries.  The same pattern was observed for the higher temperatures seen during the Medieval Warm Period. The researchers found that less than half of the planet felt the heat at once.  The research indicates that during the current period of warming, more than 98 percent of the Earth’s surface has experienced record high temperatures. The finding shows just how dramatically today’s global rise in temperatures differs from previous periods of temperature change, the scientists said.  “What we show is that these periods aren’t globally coherent as previously thought,” said Nathan Steiger, a climate scientist at Columbia University in New York City and a co-author of the Nature study. The current period of warming “stands in stark contrast” to today’s warming, he added, calling it “a globally coherent warm period that is very different from what we see in the past.”  For the Nature Geoscience study, the researchers charted global temperature averages over time, and then compared the data to a set of climate simulations to figure out what might have driven the changes. Neukom and his colleagues found that the fastest warming in the last two millennia occurred during the second half of the 20th century.  The researchers also found that the main cause of temperature fluctuations changed over time. Prior to 1850, fluctuations were mainly linked to volcanic eruptions, which cooled the planet by spewing sun-blocking ash into the stratosphere; after 1850, greenhouse gas emissions took the wheel.  “It’s exciting to see studies like this that combine rigorous statistics with huge databases to make clear conclusions about past climate change,” said Gabriela Serrato Marks, a graduate student in paleoclimatology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who wasn't involved in the new research.  Serrato Marks said the records the researchers used could be incomplete, adding that subsequent research could benefit from more robust data. “Future studies will be strengthened even more with data from the Southern Hemisphere and more high-resolution data,” she said.  Jennifer Hertzberg, a paleoclimatologist at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, who wasn’t involved in the research, called the study “very important” and praised its use of multiple statistical methods to reconstruct temperature change over time. She urged the public to take the results to heart.  “The global temperatures that we’re seeing now are higher than they have been in the last 2,000 years,” she said. “What we’re seeing now is uncharted territory. It’s time for everybody to wake up and make changes now.”  Want more stories about science?  Follow NBC News MACH on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram.

acd7cfb8	Huge reductions in meat-eating are essential to avoid dangerous climate change, according to the most comprehensive analysis yet of the food system’s impact on the environment. In western countries, beef consumption needs to fall by 90% and be replaced by five times more beans and pulses.  The research also finds that enormous changes to farming are needed to avoid destroying the planet’s ability to feed the 10 billion people expected to be on the planet in a few decades.  Food production already causes great damage to the environment, via greenhouse gases from livestock, deforestation and water shortages from farming, and vast ocean dead zones from agricultural pollution. But without action, its impact will get far worse as the world population rises by 2.3 billion people by 2050 and global income triples, enabling more people to eat meat-rich western diets.  This trajectory would smash critical environmental limits beyond which humanity will struggle to live, the new research indicates. “It is pretty shocking,” said Marco Springmann at the University of Oxford, who led the research team. “We are really risking the sustainability of the whole system. If we are interested in people being able to farm and eat, then we better not do that.”  “Feeding a world population of 10 billion is possible, but only if we change the way we eat and the way we produce food,” said Prof Johan Rockström at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, who was part of the research team. “Greening the food sector or eating up our planet: this is what is on the menu today.”  The new study follows the publication of a landmark UN report on Monday in which the world’s leading scientists warned there are just a dozen years in which to keep global warming under 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods and extreme heat. The report said eating less meat and dairy was important but said current trends were in the opposite direction.  The new research, published in the journal Nature, is the most thorough to date and combined data from every country to assess the impact of food production on the global environment. It then looked at what could be done to stop the looming food crisis.  “There is no magic bullet,” said Springmann. “But dietary and technological change [on farms] are the two essential things, and hopefully they can be complemented by reduction in food loss and waste.” About a third of food produced today never reaches the table.  The researchers found a global shift to a “flexitarian” diet was needed to keep climate change even under 2C, let alone 1.5C. This flexitarian diet means the average world citizen needs to eat 75% less beef, 90% less pork and half the number of eggs, while tripling consumption of beans and pulses and quadrupling nuts and seeds. This would halve emissions from livestock and better management of manure would enable further cuts.  In rich nations, the dietary changes required are ever more stark. UK and US citizens need to cut beef by 90% and milk by 60% while increasing beans and pulses between four and six times. However, the millions of people in poor nations who are undernourished need to eat a little more meat and dairy.  Reducing meat consumption might be achieved by a mix of education, taxes, subsidies for plant-based foods and changes to school and workplace menus, the scientists said.  To halt deforestation, water shortages and pollution from overuse of fertiliser, profound changes in farming practices are needed. These include increasing crop yields in poorer nations, more universal water storage and far more careful use of fertilisers.  “I was surprised by the fact we need a combination of very ambitious options,” Springmann said. “We really need to push it to the edge of what is possible.”  All the diet and farming options are already being implemented in somewhere in the world, said Springmann. In the Netherlands and Israel, fertilisers and water are being better used, while big cuts in meat consumption are being seen among young people in some cities.  But a global change is needed, he said: “I think we can do it, but we really need much more proactive governments to provide the right framework. People can make a personal difference by changing their diet, but also by knocking on the doors of their politicians and saying we need better environmental regulations – that is also very important. Do not let politicians off the hook.”  Prof Tim Benton at the University of Leeds, who was not part of the research team, said: “Ultimately, we live on a finite planet, with finite resources. It is a fiction to imagine there is a technological solution allowing us to produce as much food as we might ever want, allowing us to overeat and throw food away.” He said the environmental burden of the current food system “undermines the ability of future generations to live on a stable and ecologically rich planet”.  Prof Peter Smith at the University of Aberdeen, who was also not part of the research team, said: “We know food choices are very personal, and that behaviour change can be difficult to encourage, but the evidence is now unequivocal – we need to change our diets if we are to have a sustainable future. The fact that it will also make us healthier makes it a no-brainer.”	Huge reduction in meat-eating ‘essential’ to avoid climate breakdown	true
70c53cf5	"The text on the video above was edited on June 1, 2018 to make it clear that it is impossible to know why the polar bear pictured was starving. An earlier version of the video went too far in suggesting that climate change was responsible ( read more ). This story was updated on January 19, 2018 to reflect the more specific location of where the photographs were taken.  When photographer Paul Nicklen and filmmakers from conservation group Sea Legacy arrived on Somerset Island—near the larger Baffin Island—in the Canadian Arctic in late summer, they came across a heartbreaking sight: a starving polar bear on its deathbed.  Nicklen is no stranger to bears. From the time he was a child growing up in Canada's far north the biologist turned wildlife photographer has seen over 3,000 bears in the wild. But the emaciated polar bear, featured in videos Nicklen published to social media on December 5, was one of the most gut-wrenching sights he's ever seen.  ""We stood there crying—filming with tears rolling down our cheeks,"" he said.  Video shows the polar bear clinging to life, its white hair limply covering its thin, bony frame. One of the bear's back legs drags behind it as it walks, likely due to muscle atrophy. Looking for food, the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by Inuit fishers. It finds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground.  In the days since Nicklen posted the footage, he's been asked why he didn’t intervene.  ""Of course, that crossed my mind,"" said Nicklen. ""But it's not like I walk around with a tranquilizer gun or 400 pounds of seal meat.""  And even if he did, said Nicklen, he only would have been prolonging the bear's misery. Plus, feeding wild polar bears is illegal in Canada.  The wildlife photographer says he filmed the bear's slow, beleaguered death because he didn't want it to die in vain.  ""When scientists say bears are going extinct, I want people to realize what it looks like. Bears are going to starve to death,"" said Nicklen. ""This is what a starving bear looks like.""  The Climate Change Link?  By telling the story of one polar bear, Nicklen hopes to convey a larger message about how a warming climate has deadly consequences.  Polar bears have long been unwitting mascots for the effects of climate change. As animals that live only in Arctic regions, they're often the first to feel the impacts of warming temperatures and rising seas.  The large, half-ton bears find concentrations of seals on sea ice. During summer months, it's not uncommon for polar bears to go months without eating while they wait for Arctic ice to solidify.  In 2002, a World Wildlife Fund report predicted that climate change could eventually lead to polar bear endangerment or extinction. Even then, the report found that polar bears were moving from ice to land earlier and staying on land longer, unhealthily extending the bears' fasting season. By the end of summer, most bears studied by the World Wildlife Fund showed signs of starvation.  Fifteen years later, polar bears' icy hunting grounds are in even worse shape. The National Snow and Ice Data Center, which tracks sea ice cover annually, has regularly noted record lows in sea ice coverage—a decline that is expected to only get worse. (Read more about drastic predictions for dwindling sea ice.)  A study recently published in the journal Biosciences looked at how climate science is often falsely discredited. The study found climate deniers are able to downplay the threat of climate change by discrediting the threat facing polar bears.

00c29642	Worst-case global heating scenarios may need to be revised upwards in light of a better understanding of the role of clouds, scientists have said.  Recent modelling data suggests the climate is considerably more sensitive to carbon emissions than previously believed, and experts said the projections had the potential to be “incredibly alarming”, though they stressed further research would be needed to validate the new numbers.  Modelling results from more than 20 institutions are being compiled for the sixth assessment by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is due to be released next year.  Compared with the last assessment in 2014, 25% of them show a sharp upward shift from 3C to 5C in climate sensitivity – the amount of warming projected from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide from the preindustrial level of 280 parts per million. This has shocked many veteran observers, because assumptions about climate sensitivity have been relatively unchanged since the 1980s.  “That is a very deep concern,” Johan Rockström, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said. “Climate sensitivity is the holy grail of climate science. It is the prime indicator of climate risk. For 40 years, it has been around 3C. Now, we are suddenly starting to see big climate models on the best supercomputers showing things could be worse than we thought.”  He said climate sensitivity above 5C would reduce the scope for human action to reduce the worst impacts of global heating. “We would have no more space for a soft landing of 1.5C [above preindustrial levels]. The best we could aim for is 2C,” he said.  Worst-case projections in excess of 5C have been generated by several of the world’s leading climate research bodies, including the UK Met Office’s Hadley Centre and the EU’s Community Earth System Model.  Timothy Palmer, a professor in climate physics at Oxford University and a member of the Met Office’s advisory board, said the high figure initially made scientists nervous. “It was way outside previous estimates. People asked whether there was a bug in the code,” he said. “But it boiled down to relatively small changes in the way clouds are represented in the models.”  The role of clouds is one of the most uncertain areas in climate science because they are hard to measure and, depending on altitude, droplet temperature and other factors, can play either a warming or a cooling role. For decades, this has been the focus of fierce academic disputes.  Previous IPCC reports tended to assume that clouds would have a neutral impact because the warming and cooling feedbacks would cancel each other out. But in the past year and a half, a body of evidence has been growing showing that the net effect will be warming. This is based on finer resolution computer models and advanced cloud microphysics.  “Clouds will determine humanity’s fate – whether climate is an existential threat or an inconvenience that we will learn to live with,” said Palmer. “Most recent models suggest clouds will make matters worse.”  In a recent paper in the journal Nature, Palmer explains how the new Hadley Centre model that produced the 5+C figure on climate sensitivity was tested by assessing its accuracy in forecasting short-term weather. This testing technique had exposed flaws in previous models, but in the latest case, the results reinforced the estimates. “The results are not reassuring – they support the estimates,” he wrote. He is calling for other models to be tested in a similar way.  “It’s really important. The message to the government and public is, you have to take this high climate sensitivity seriously. [We] must get emissions down as quickly as we can,” he said.  The IPCC is expected to include the 5+C climate sensitivity figure in its next report on the range of possible outcomes. Scientists caution that this is a work in progress and that doubts remain because such a high figure does not fit with historical records.  Catherine Senior, head of understanding climate change at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said more studies and more data were needed to fully understand the role of clouds and aerosols.  “This figure has the potential to be incredibly alarming if it is right,” she said. “But as a scientist, my first response is: why has the model done that? We are still in the stage of evaluating the processes driving the different response.”  While acknowledging the continued uncertainty, Rockström said climate models might still be underestimating the problem because they did not fully take into account tipping points in the biosphere.  “The more we learn, the more fragile the Earth system seems to be and the faster we need to move,” he said. “It gives even stronger argument to step out of this Covid-19 crisis and move full speed towards decarbonising the economy.”	Climate worst-case scenarios may not go far enough, cloud data shows	partially false
a73a57a1	There is no “climate emergency”, according to a study for the Global Warming Policy Foundation by independent scientist Dr Indur Goklany.  Goklany concludes:  While climate may have changed for the warmer: • Most extreme weather phenomena have not become more extreme, more deadly, or more destructive • Empirical evidence directly contradicts claims that increased carbon dioxide has reduced human wellbeing. In fact, human wellbeing has never been higher • Whatever detrimental effects warming and higher carbon dioxide may have had on terrestrial species and ecosystems, they have been swamped by the contribution of fossil fuels to increased biological productivity. This has halted, and turned around, reductions in habitat loss  The report will make hugely depressing reading for all the prominent environmental activists — from the Pope and Doom Goblin Greta Thunberg to the Great Reset’s Klaus Schwab — who have been pushing the “climate emergency” narrative. It is an article of faith for the globalist elite and their useful idiots in the media, in politics, in business, and the entertainment that the world is on course for climate disaster which only radical and costly international action can prevent.  But Goklany’s report — Impacts of Climate Change: Perception & Reality — claims there is little if any evidence to support the scare narrative.  At the end, Goklany provides a table, setting out all the scaremongering claims made by environmental groups — and then comparing them with observed reality. Only one of the claims stands up, according to the study — weather has been getting slightly warmer:  More hot days and fewer cold days — Yes Cyclones/hurricanes more intense or frequent — No Tornadoes increase and become more intense — No Floods more frequent and more intense — No Droughts more frequent and intense — No Area burned by wildfire increasing — No (area peaked in mid-19th century) Cereal yields decreasing — No (they have tripled since 1961) Food supplies per capita decreasing — No (increased 31 per cent since 1961) Land area and beaches shrinking, coral islands submerged — No. (Marginal expansion)  None of the doom-mongering claims made about a decline in human welfare stands up, either, according to the study.  Access to cleaner water has increased; mortality from ‘Extreme Weather Events’ has declined by 99 per cent since the 1920s; fewer people are dying from heat; death rates from climate-sensitive diseases like malaria and diarrhoea have decreased (since 1900 malaria death rates have declined 96 per cent); hunger rates have declined; poverty has declined (GDP per capita has quadrupled since 1950 even as CO2 levels have sextupled); life expectancy has more than doubled since the start of industrialisation; health adjusted life expectancy has increased; global inequality has decreased in terms of incomes, life expectancies and access to modern-day amenities; the earth is green and more productive; habitat lost to agriculture has peaked due to fossil fuel dependent technologies.  It will be hard for green activists to dismiss Goklany as a “denier”. His credentials as a climate expert are impeccable. He was a member of the U.S. delegation that established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and helped develop its First Assessment Report. He subsequently served as a U.S. delegate to the IPCC, and as an IPCC reviewer.  Goklany says:  Almost everywhere you look, climate change is having only small, and often benign, impacts. The impact of extreme weather events ― hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and droughts ― are, if anything, declining. Economic damages have declined as a fraction of global GDP. Death rates from such events have declined by 99% since the 1920s. Climate-related disease has collapsed. And more people die from cold than warm temperatures.  Even sea-level rise — predicted to be the most damaging impact of global warming — seems to be much less of a problem than thought, according to to the study’s findings.  Goklany says:  A recent study showed that the Earth has actually gained more land in coastal areas in the last 30 years than it has lost through sea-level rise. We now know for sure that coral atolls aren’t disappearing and even Bangladesh is gaining more land through siltation than it is losing through rising seas.  In his report, Goklany destroys many of the green movement’s shibboleths, including the notion that fossil fuels are bad for the planet. Not only, he suggests, has their CO2 contributed to “global greening” — “contrary to prevailing wisdom, tree cover globally has increased by over 2 million km2 between 1982 and 2016, an increase of 7 per cent” — but they provide the fertilisers and pesticides which simultaneously feed the planet and reduce the amount of land required for agriculture:	Delingpole: Study Disputes That Earth Is in a ‘Climate Emergency’	partially false
648e6bc4	Despite recent attempts to paint the United States as a major global polluter, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. is among the cleanest nations on the planet.  In the most recent WHO report on air pollution, the United States was listed as one of the countries with the cleanest air in the world, significantly cleaner in fact than the air in Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the UK, Japan, Austria and France.  While France and other G7 countries lamented the U.S. exit from the Paris climate accord, America’s air is already cleaner than that of any other country in the G7, except Canada with its scant population.  Following standard practice, the WHO measures air pollution by the mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter. These are the particles that cause diseases of all sorts and are responsible for most deaths by air pollution.  According to the WHO, exposure to particulate matter increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke and lung cancer.  The report, which analyzed the “annual median concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) for both urban population and rural and urban population” found that the United States was one of the most pollution-free nations in the world.  The annual mean concentrations of particulate matter in the air range from less than 10 to over 100 µg/m3, the report states. At the very low end of the spectrum, the United States has a concentration of just 8, while China has a concentration more than seven times higher at 59, India at 66, Egypt at 101 and Saudi Arabia with the worst air pollution at 127.  “The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter is a common measure of air pollution,” the WHO states.  The WHO report is corroborated by a series of other such studies on air and water pollution.  In a recent list of the 25 cleanest cities in the world, the only country to boast three cities among the cleanest on the planet was the United States of America, with Chicago coming in second place, Honolulu coming in fourth, and Portland, OR, coming in sixteenth. Unsurprisingly, no cities from China, Russia or India made the list at all.  Similarly, another list of the 15 most polluted cities in the world featured three cities from China, three cities from Saudi Arabia, and a whopping seven cities from India. No U.S. city made the list.  A third list, ranking the ten cleanest and ten most polluted cities in the world, placed two U.S. cities on the list of cleanest cities on the planet. The list of the most polluted cities in the world was led by two cities from China followed by two more cities from India. Two Russian cities also made the list. Again, no U.S. cities were found here.  With such relatively clean air throughout America, how can even reputable news agencies like Reuters continue spreading the well-worn lie that the United States is one of the “biggest polluters” in the world?  Rather than follow the time-tested practice used by the World Health Organization, which measures levels of disease-causing pollutants that get into people’s lungs, some have played a shell game, swapping a new measure of “pollution” based solely on emissions of carbon dioxide.  The problem with this ploy is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is dishonest to say it is. CO2 is colorless, odorless and completely non-toxic. Plants depend on it to live and grow, and human beings draw some into their lungs with every breath they take to no ill effect whatsoever.  Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.  Current levels of carbon dioxide concentration in the environment are substantially lower than they have been during earlier periods in the planet’s history. Without human intervention, the concentration of CO2 has climbed as high as 7,000 parts per million (ppm) in prior eras, whereas at present the concentration is just over 400 ppm.  Some experts, such as UN climate scientist Dr. Indur Goklany, have defended rising CO2 levels as a good thing for humanity. Goklany has argued that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere “is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally.”  “The benefits are real, whereas the costs of warming are uncertain,” he said.  While the United States must remain vigilant to keep the level of real, dangerous pollutants to a minimum, it may take some consolation in the fact that among G7 nations, it has the cleanest air of all.

acc4517a	It was an accurate and judicious answer, so naturally it sent climate alarmists into paroxysms of condemnation. The Washington Post slammed Pruitt as a “denier” driven by “unreason.” Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii called Pruitt’s views “extreme” and “irresponsible” — proof of his unfitness to head the EPA. Gina McCarthy, who ran the agency under President Obama, bewailed the danger global warming poses “to all of us who call Earth home,” and said she couldn’t “imagine what additional information [Pruitt] might want from scientists” in order to understand that.  Replied Pruitt: “No. I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So no — I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. But we don’t know that yet. We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.”  ‘Do you believe,” CNBC’s Joe Kernen asked Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency’s new director, in an interview last Thursday, “that it’s been proven that CO2 is the primary control knob for climate?”  Yet for all the hyperventilating, Pruitt’s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate’s “primary control knob” — was entirely sound. “We don’t know that yet,” he said. We don’t. CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent. Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all.  Advertisement  There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor, thereby increasing warming through a “positive feedback loop.” But that theory so far is mostly speculative; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed, nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred. It should go without saying that if scientists cannot yet make accurate predictions about future climate change, then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete.  Advertisement  Earth’s climate system is unfathomably complex. It is affected by innumerable interacting variables, atmospheric CO2 levels being just one. The more variables there are in any system or train of events, the lower the probability of all of them coming to pass. Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2, but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 — i.e., ½ x ½ Extending your winning streak to a third guess is even less probable: just 1 in 8.  Apply that approach to climate change, and it becomes clear why the best response to the alarmists’ frantic predictions is a healthy skepticism.  The list of variables that shape climate includes cloud formation, topography, altitude, proximity to the equator, plate tectonics, sunspot cycles, volcanic activity, expansion or contraction of sea ice, conversion of land to agriculture, deforestation, reforestation, direction of winds, soil quality, El Niño and La Niña ocean cycles, prevalence of aerosols (airborne soot, dust, and salt) — and, of course, atmospheric greenhouse gases, both natural and manmade. A comprehensive list would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision.  Advertisement  But for the sake of argument, say there are merely 15 variables involved in predicting global climate change, and assume that climatologists have mastered each one to a near-perfect accuracy of 95 percent. What are the odds that a climate model built on a system that simple would be reliable? Less than 50/50. (Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent.) Is it any surprise that climate-change predictions in the real world — where the complexities are exponentially greater and the exactitude of knowledge much less — have such a poor track record?  Pruitt got it right: Measuring human impacts on climate is indeed “very challenging.” The science is far from settled. That is why calls to radically reduce carbon emissions are so irresponsible — and why dire warnings of what will happen if we don’t are little better than reckless fearmongering.

63b1812f	"Hurricane Florence is not climate change or global warming. It's just the weather. Hurricane Florence is not the result of global warming. It's likely due to natural weather patterns, not climate change as some have already said.  Even before Hurricane Florence made landfall somewhere near the border of North and South Carolina, predicted damage from potentially catastrophic flooding from the storm was already being blamed on global warming.  Writing for NBC News, Kristina Dahl contended, “With each new storm, we are forced to question whether this is our new, climate change-fueled reality, and to ask ourselves what we can do to minimize the toll from supercharged storms.”  The theory is that tropical cyclones have slowed down in their speed by about 10 percent over the past 70 years due to a retreat of the jet stream farther north, depriving storms of steering currents and making them stall and keep raining in one location. This is what happened with Hurricane Harvey in Houston last year.  But like most claims regarding global warming, the real effect is small, probably temporary, and most likely due to natural weather patterns. Any changes in hurricanes over 70 years, even if real, can easily be part of natural cycles — or incomplete data. Coastal lake sediments along the Gulf of Mexico shoreline from 1,000 to 2,000 years ago suggest more frequent and intense hurricanes than occur today. Why? No one knows.  Unusual things happen in nature sometimes  The Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635 experienced a Category 3 or 4 storm, with up to a 20-foot storm surge. While such a storm does not happen in New England anymore, it happened again there in 1675, with elderly eyewitnesses comparing it to the 1635 storm.  Until 2017, the United States went 11 years without a major hurricane strike — something that is statistically very improbable. Nine years into that 11-year hurricane drought, a NASA scientist computed it as a 1-in-177-year event.  My point is that nature varies, and unusual things happen sometimes.  More: Is Trump some semi-God who conjured extreme weather?  Uncontrolled climate change could result in disaster for our kids. Will we do something?  We're keeping our Paris climate change commitments and our economies are booming: Governors  Now it’s fashionable to blame stalling hurricanes on global warming. In the case of Florence, the jet stream is indeed pushed farther north. But examination of a weather map of the atmospheric flow at an altitude of 18,000 feet shows the jet stream is pushed farther south over western North America. This kind of natural variation in atmospheric flow is called weather, not climate change. It’s just a roll of the dice. Hurricane-steering currents are subject to whatever the weather happens to be when they arrive at the U.S. coast.  No one should dismiss or minimize the damage that Florence will likely do. Hurricanes can be deadly. I completely agree with Ms. Dahl's NBC News piece that “right now, our number one priority has to be ensuring the safety of those in Florence’s evolving path, as well as the first responders helping them.”  The cost of storms has risen, not their severity  But a major hurricane hits North Carolina on average once every 20 years or so. The last was Fran in 1996, which is 22 years ago. Coastal residents know they live under a yearly threat of hurricanes, and sometimes (though relatively rarely), one of those hurricanes will be very strong.  Well, aren’t we being told these storms are getting stronger on average? The answer is no. The 30 most costly hurricanes in U.S. history (according to federal data from January) show no increase in intensity over time. The monetary cost of damages has increased dramatically in recent decades, but that is due to increasing population, wealth and the amount of vulnerable infrastructure. It’s not due to stronger storms.  If humans have any influence on hurricanes at all, it probably won’t be evident for many decades to come. Natural variability is simply too large. This should not be surprising given that humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions have caused only a 1 percent change in the natural energy flows coursing through the climate system.  Roy W.

46e9b5bb	"Two environmentalists have declared a “global climate emergency” after the Northern hemisphere jet stream was found to have crossed the equator, bringing “unprecedented” changes to the world’s weather patterns.  Robert Scribbler and University of Ottawa researcher Paul Beckwith warned of the “weather-destabilising and extreme weather-generating” consequences of the jet stream shift.  However other scientists dismissed their claims, with one describing their concern over wind crossing the equator as ""total nonsense"".  Scribbler and Beckwith said the anomalies were most likely precipitated by man-made climate change, which caused the jet stream to slow down and create larger waves.  Scribbler wrote in a post on his environmental blog on Tuesday: “It’s the very picture of weather-weirding due to climate change. Something that would absolutely not happen in a normal world. Something, that if it continues, basically threatens seasonal integrity.  The blogger explained the barrier between the two jet streams generates the strong divide between summer and winter, and the “death of winter” could commence if it is eroded as warm weather leaks into the “winter zone” of the year.

He said: “Our climate system behaviour continues to behave in new and scary ways that we have never anticipated, or seen before.  “Welcome to climate chaos. We must declare a global climate emergency.  “The behaviour of the jet stream suggests massive hits to the [global] food supply and the potential for massive geopolitical unrest.

de2b62d8	The role of forests in combating climate change risks being overlooked by the world’s governments, according to a group of scientists that has warned halting deforestation is “just as urgent” as eliminating the use of fossil fuels.  Razing the world’s forests would release more than 3 trillion tons of carbon dioxide, more than the amount locked in identified global reserves of oil, coal and gas. By protecting and restoring forests, the world would achieve 18% of the emissions mitigation needed by 2030 to avoid runaway climate change, the group of 40 scientists, spanning five countries, said in a statement.  “We must protect and maintain healthy forests to avoid dangerous climate change and to ensure the world’s forests continue to provide services critical for the well-being of the planet and ourselves,” the statement reads.  The intervention comes as the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gathers in South Korea ahead of Monday’s release of an eagerly awaited report on how the world can avoid warming of 1.5C (2.7F) beyond pre-industrial levels, an aspirational target of the landmark Paris climate deal in 2015.  It is expected the report will focus on required changes to the energy system, rather than forests. “In responding to the IPCC report, our message as scientists is simple: Our planet’s future climate is inextricably tied to the future of its forests,” the scientists’ statement pointedly concludes.  Trees and other vegetation currently absorb around a quarter of the CO 2 humans are adding to the atmosphere, softening the potential impact of climate change.  While the world won’t lose all of its trees, large tracts of tropical forests, which hold a vast amount of carbon, are still being lost in the Amazon, central Africa and Indonesia. Warming temperatures are also fueling huge fires in forests in higher latitudes, as witnessed this summer when much of northern Sweden was aflame.  “The forest piece of the conversation is often lost and I don’t think the IPCC report will highlight it enough,” said Deborah Lawrence, a professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and a signatory of the statement. “We almost take forests as a given but we lose forest every year, which means we are diminishing them as a carbon sink.  “Deforestation has been massively reduced in the Amazon, but that hasn’t happened elsewhere. As countries get more peaceful in Africa we could lose more tropical forests, which really worries me.”  The IPCC’s report is expected to mention the need for as-yet unproven technology to burn vegetation and bury the resulting emissions underground or directly suck carbon from the air as a way to meet the 1.5C target.  The statement by Lawrence and other scientists warns the former strategy, known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (Beccs), is untested and risks wiping out huge areas of rainforest in order to make way for plantation timber for energy.  “It breaks my heart to think we’d lose half our tropical forests for plantations just to save ourselves,” Lawrence said. “It’s horrifying that we’d lose our biodiversity to avert climate change. Losing tropical forests is not somehow cheaper than putting up wind farms in the US or Sahara.”  Lawrence said a steep drop in emissions to zero by 2040 would negate the need for “negative emissions” technology that would damage forests’ ability to suck up carbon, maintain local water supplies and weather patterns and provide a home for a riot of birds, mammals, insects and other creatures.  “We will have a hotter, drier world without these forests,” Lawrence said. “There needs to be an international price on carbon to fund the protection of forests. And countries with tropical forests should maintain large chunks of forests to stabilize rainfall for agriculture and keep a predictable regional climate.”  The prospects for averting at least 1.5C of warming appear dim, however, with a co-author of the upcoming IPCC report warning last week the world is “nowhere near on track” to meet its Paris commitments.

NASA posted this video to YouTube with this description, “Arctic sea ice has not only been shrinking in surface area in recent years, it’s becoming younger and thinner as well. In this animation, where the ice cover almost looks gelatinous as it pulses through the seasons, cryospheric scientist Dr. Walt Meier of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center describes how the sea ice has undergone fundamental changes during the era of satellite measurements.”  2017 was once again one of the hottest years on record, ranked as the second-warmest by NASA and third-warmest by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The findings “continue the planet’s long-term warming trend,” according to NASA. A trend that is driven predominately by human activity through carbon dioxide emissions.  Temperature records for the planet, monitored independently by both agencies, go back to 1880. The announcement came at a joint press conference on Thursday in Washington.  The hottest year on record remains 2016, while 2015 ranks second according to NOAA and third by NASA, which means the top three years have been the most recent three.  Though 2017 was slightly cooler on average compared to 2016. the trend towards a warmer planet has never been clearer.  The six hottest years have all occurred since 2010 and 17 of the 18 hottest years on record have occurred since 2001.  According to NASA, the globally averaged temperature of the land and ocean was 0.9˚C (1.62˚F) above the 20th century average. This puts us well over halfway to the ambitious target of limiting warming to 1.5˚ C (2.7˚F) set in the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement.  Scientists believe if that if we are to avoid exceeding that limit, carbon emissions would need to be significantly reduced starting immediately.  La Niña not enough to cool us down  The slight downturn in temperatures this year can be partially explained by the presence of La Niña, which began in late 2016 and lasted into 2017 and returned late in the year — whereas a robust El Niño was in place during portions of 2015 and 2016.  El Niño is characterized by a warming of the surface waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean — which tends to drive up global temperatures. Therefore years containing El Niños tend to be warmer globally than other years.  La Niñas, on the other hand, feature cooler than average waters in the Pacific, and tend to cool the planet down.  The fact that 2017 was the second- or third-warmest year on record, despite the presence of a cooling La Niña, speaks to the overall warming trend the Earth is experiencing thanks to overall global warming.  According to NASA, if “the effects of the recent El Niño and La Niña patterns were statistically removed from the record, 2017 would have been the warmest year on record.”  Global climate highlights of 2017  Sea ice continued its declining trend, both in the Arctic and Antarctic. The Antarctic, which was trending at record high levels just a few years ago, reached a record low during 2017, with ice covering 154,000 fewer square miles than the previous record low set in 1986.  In the Arctic, sea ice extent was the second-lowest since records began in 1979, behind only 2016, though record low sea ice was observed during the winter months of January-March.  Temperatures significantly warmer than normal around the planet did not mean there was a lack of snow, however. In the northern hemisphere, the average snow cover extent was the largest since 1985 and the eighth largest since records began in 1968, according to Rutgers University’s Global Snow Lab.  2017 also featured a number of extreme weather events, most notably the record number of major hurricanes impacting the US and Caribbean, which led to the costliest year for weather disasters in US history.

ba39a59d	The far-left ThinkProgress reports that scientists have finally proven that the theory of man-made Global Warming is a total hoax.  Of course, no one will admit it, but that is exactly what has happened.  A new scientific study shows has revealed the following:  Current CO2 levels of 410 parts per million (ppm) were last seen on Earth three million years ago, according to the most detailed reconstruction of the Earth’s climate by researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and published in Science Advances.  Yes, you read that correctly, three million — million — years ago CO2 levels on Earth were the same as they are today, but there is one major difference between three million years ago and today…  Three million years ago, we humans were not driving cars or eating the meat that requires cow farts; we weren’t barbecuing or refusing to recycle or building factories; there was no Industrial Age, no plastic, no air conditioning, no electricity, no lumber mills, no consumerism, no aerosols.  In fact, three million years ago, there were probably no human beings on Earth, at least not human in the way we use that term today. And yet…  CO2 levels were the same then as they are now…  Hmmm…?  But I thought humans warmed the planet? That’s the hustle we’ve been sold for three decades now — you know, that WE are the problem.  We have also been told the problem is DEFINITELY NOT a billions-year-old planet running through cycles where the temperature might fluctuate a bit. Oh, no, that could never be it — so stop saying that could be, you Denier.  Well, what about the Ice Age that occurred thousands and thousands of years before the Industrial Age.  Shut up, Denier.  And yet…  According to the study, scientists also discovered that during this period of Global Warming “there were no ice sheets covering either Greenland or West Antarctica, and much of the East Antarctic ice sheet was gone.”  How is this possible 2,999,971 years before Arnold Schwarzenegger bought his Hummer?  It gets worse:  Temperatures were up to 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer globally, at least double that at the poles, and sea levels were some 20 meters (65 feet) higher.  How is that possible 2,999,945 years before Americans moved to the suburbs and lit up the charcoal grills?  Naturally, even in the face of a study that totally debunks the whole concept of man-made Global Warming, ThinkProgress is sticking with that hoax but is also forced to concede the following:  The good news is that the Earth does not warm instantly, and mile-thick ice sheets melt even more slowly. So the temperature rise will take several decades, and tens of feet of sea level rise will take hundreds and hundreds of years.  But-but-but-but Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy told me we only have 12 years!  And then ThinkProgress drops this anti-science stink bomb:  That means the choices we make now can affect the rate of rise and determine whether we blow past 65 feet of sea level rise to beyond 200 feet.  Because, because, because Orange Man Bad:  Even worse, the climate policy agenda President Donald Trump is pushing — actions that include rolling back U.S. laws that reduce carbon pollution and abandoning the Paris climate agreement — would lock us in to such high CO2 levels, sea levels would rise a foot per decade in just a few decades.  No, actually, what this study proves is that there is nothing we can do to stop the Earth’s naturally occurring climate cycles. Even the worst of the worst, even the most maniacal pushing the Global Warming Hoax admit that, at best, we can only cool the planet a couple of degrees, which will do next to nothing if the planet is determined to again warm itself by seven degrees, as we now know it did 2,999,998 years before the Bad Orange Man approved a couple of pipelines.

4854c659	“Global warming” is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017.  In other words, the so-called “Consensus” on global warming is a massive lie. And Donald Trump was quite right to quit the Paris agreement which pretended that the massive lie was true.  By “global warming” these papers don’t, of course, mean the mild warming of around 0.8 degrees Celsius that the planet has experienced since the middle of the 19th century as the world crawled out of the Little Ice Age. Pretty much everyone, alarmists and skeptics alike, is agreed on that.  Rather, they mean “global warming” in the sense that is most commonly used today by grant-troughing scientists, and huxter politicians, and scaremongering green activists, and brainwashed mainstream media (MSM) environmental correspondents. “Global warming” as in the scary, historically unprecedented, primarily man-made phenomenon which we must address urgently before the icecaps melt and the Pacific islands disappear beneath the waves and all the baby polar bears drown.  What all these papers argue in their different ways is that the alarmist version of global warming — aka Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW) — is a fake artefact.  That is, all these different experts from around the world — China, Russia, Canada, the U.S., Italy, etc. — have been looking closely at different aspects of the global warming puzzle in various regions and on different timescales and come to the conclusion in irreproachable, peer-reviewed scientific ways that there is no evidence to support the global warming scare story.  Late 20th century and early 21st century global warming, they show, is neither dramatic, nor unusual, nor scary.  Here, as collated by Kenneth Richard at No Tricks Zone, are just some of the charts to prove it.  Büntgen et al, below, shows that temperatures in the northern hemisphere were warmer in the early 1400s than they are today  Abrantes et al (below) confirms the traditional view — which Michael Mann tried to dismiss with his discredited Hockey Stick chart — that the Medieval Warming Period was warmer than anything we have experienced in our own era.  Here’s one from Li et al showing that China was much warmer 8,000 years ago  Here’s an unusual one from Guillet et al suggesting that there’s nothing new about wildly early or late grape harvests through the centuries:  And on and on it goes — there are 80 graphs in all, each showing in its different way why the scare about global warming has been horribly overdone because the evidence just doesn’t support its being unusual or a problem. Several of the papers note that the primary influence on warming appears to be solar activity. Few, if any, entertain the notion that carbon dioxide levels have much to do with it.  The intellectually corrupt and mendacious alarmist science establishment — I’m thinking, for example, of my personal bete noir, the left-wing political activist and Nobel-prizewinning geneticist Sir Paul Nurse, former president of the Royal Society — would have us believe that climate skepticism is a minority activity, the preserve of a few cranks, championed only by people who don’t do the science. But this is just ugly propaganda.  Here are dozens of reputable scientists from around the world with no axe to grind collaborating on studies which all corroborate, independently and rigorously, the increasingly respectable view that “man-made global warming” just isn’t a thing.  Not that it ever was a thing, really. This debate — as I argue at some length in Watermelons — was always about left-wing ideology, quasi-religious hysteria, and “follow the money” corruption, never about “science.”  Still, it’s always a comfort to know that “the science” is on our side too.  They do so hate that fact, the Greenies.	DELINGPOLE: ‘Global Warming’ Is a Myth, Say 58 Scientific Papers in 2017	partially false
da8075a2	"More than 3 billion people could potentially end up living in unbearable heat in the next 50 years, a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America showed.  While the worst-case scenario says 3 billion people may be impacted, the Associated Press reported that the more likely scenarios from the study show that at least one billion people will be affected.  The number of people impacted depends on what action is taken to reduce carbon emissions.  There are currently 20 million people impacted by extremely high temperatures.  Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.  As many as half of the current world's population could be dealing with ""unlivable heat"" by 2070, a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America showed.  In the next 50 years, somewhere between 1 to 3 billion people are expected to be inflicted with unbearable heat, according to the study. By 2070, that could be about a third of the overall global population at that time.  Marten Scheffer of Wageningen University in the Netherlands, an ecologist and co-author of the study, told the Associated Press the projections are ""unlivable for the ordinary, for poor people, for the average world citizen.""  The actual number of people affected will depend on how fast the global population grows and the levels of carbon emissions, the AP reported.  While the worst-case scenario expects over 3 billion people to be impacted, more likely scenarios from the study show that at least 1 billion people will be affected, the AP reported.  ""It's a huge amount, and it's a short time. This is why we're worried,"" Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald told the AP.  Mahowald wasn't apart of the study but told the AP that ""the new study makes sense and conveys the urgency of the man-made climate change differently than past research.""  Scheffer told the AP that for every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit increase in global average annual temperature ""from man-made climate change,"" about a billion people will end up in areas too warm to live.  Greenhouse gas emissions have to be reduced so average annual temperatures don't rise beyond the approximately 52 to 59 degrees Fahrenheit yearly average that humans have been able to thrive in for the past 6,000 years, USA Today reported.  ""We show that in a business-as-usual climate change scenario, the geographical position of this temperature niche is projected to shift more over the coming 50 years than it has moved (in the past 6,000 years),"" the study said.  The AP reported that the range was found after scientists looked at ""humans like they do bears, birds, and bees to find the 'climate niche' where people and civilizations flourish."" While humans can live in hotter and colder weather, the further away from that range the harder it is.  The researchers looked at areas most likely to experience the change in range and estimated that around 2 billion people will be living there in the next 50 years.  The study found that large parts of Africa, Asia, South America, and Australia are likely to increase their temperature similar to what 20 million people are already experiencing in places like the Sahara Desert where the annual average temperature is more than 84 degrees Fahrenheit, the AP reported.  ""Large areas of the planet would heat to barely survivable levels and they wouldn't cool down again,"" Scheffer told USA Today. ""Not only would this have devastating direct effects, it leaves societies less able to cope with future crises like new pandemics. The only thing that can stop this happening is a rapid cut in carbon emissions."""	3 billion people — up to half the current global population — could be living in unbearable heat in 50 years	partially false
5c3d8916	The Great Barrier Reef  Why care about reefs? In a word—biodiversity. The reef is home to 3,000 varieties of mollusks, over a hundred types of jellyfish, 1,625 species of fish, hundreds of shark and ray species, and over 30 kinds of whales and dolphins. These sea creatures call the soft and hard corals that make up the reef “home.” And without it, many of them will die.  If that’s not enough, it has the distinction of being the largest living structure on the planet.  The Great Barrier Reef is home to 3,000 individual coral reefs stretching across a staggering 2,575 kilometers (1,600 miles), covering an area of about 344,400 square kilometers (133,000 square miles.)  Unfortunately, because of back to back mass bleaching events, scientists are telling us that the massive, impressive Australian Great Barrier Reef is now at a ‘terminal stage’—with large portions having no hope of recovery.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Mass bleaching, a phenomenon caused by global warming, is prompted when the water warms to a point that corals begin ejecting the symbiotic algae in their tissue, essential for their survival. Throughout history, there have only been four instances of this occurrence, and after such an event, it will take decades to recover.  “This is the fourth time the Great Barrier Reef has bleached severely – in 1998, 2002, 2016, and now in 2017. Bleached corals are not necessarily dead corals, but in the severe central region we anticipate high levels of coral loss,” said researcher James Kerry, from James Cook University’s ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, in an official statement. He clarifies why the 2017 bleaching is significant: “It takes at least a decade for a full recovery of even the fastest growing corals, so mass bleaching events 12 months apart offers zero prospect of recovery for reefs that were damaged in 2016.”  Death Toll  The newest aerial surveys covered over 8,000 kilometers (5,000) miles, which includes 800 individual coral reefs.  According to the surveys, 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) of the Great Barrier Reef is now bleached. These new statistics come less than a year after 93 percent of the reef suffered severe damage, with reports adding that the effects have also spread further south.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Combined with the mass bleaching event, the arrival of Tropical Cyclone Debbie added to the devastation, as it struck a section of the reef that managed to escape the worst of the bleaching.  In an interview with The Guardian, scientists note just how dire the situation is. “We’ve given up,” said Jon Brodie, a James Cook University water quality expert, who was referring to inaction on the part of the Australian government. “It’s been my life managing water quality, we’ve failed.”  Unfortunately, in this age of global warming, temperatures are expected to continue rising, which means more of these bleaching events will happen, and they will cause even more damage. And the reality is, this could be the last generation who will get to see the grand beauty of this reef.  Fortunately, it’s not too late for us to save the rest of the planet from the worst effects of climate change. But we must act now.

43daeaa5	The recent drought has highlighted the pressure that a changing climate puts on a snowpack-dependent water system. With the shift toward more rain rather than snow, and the earlier melting of the snowpack, water managers need to release water more frequently for flood control. This dynamic is playing out in Oroville now, with the state’s water managers racing to empty water from the dam’s reservoir in advance of storms forecast to arrive Wednesday. Because these storms are relatively warm, they are likely to bring rain to the surrounding mountains, speeding the flow of water behind the dam.  The juxtaposition of five years of hot, dry conditions followed by more rain than reservoirs can store may seem incongruous. However, this is exactly what climate scientists have predicted for California since at least the 1980s: protracted periods of warm, dry conditions punctuated by intense wet spells, with more rain and less snow, causing both drought and floods. Recent work from my lab shows that in fact this pattern is already emerging, with the conditions that create extremely warm dry years and extremely wet years both becoming more frequent.  The other bitter reality is that this extremely wet winter will not wash away the drought. Depending where one looks, California lost out on one to three full years of precipitation from 2012 to 2016. That is a lot of water to make up in one year, and as of last week almost half of California was still in a state of drought. The moisture deficits that have accumulated during the drought have not been seen in our lifetimes. They have caused thousands of California residents to go without running water, resulted in groundwater contamination and permanent loss of aquifer storage capacity, and have severely stressed tens of millions of trees. As a result, even after this wet year, rural communities, groundwater aquifers and forest ecosystems will still feel the effects of the drought.  As the last five years illustrate, California’s water system is not equipped for climate change’s “new normal.” That water system must simultaneously provide for the country’s largest population and agricultural sector, and one of its most diverse natural environments. Although California has greatly improved water-use efficiency in the last half-century, climate change is pushing our water system to the limit. Investments in “climate smart” infrastructure can ensure the safety and security of Americans in the face of climate stresses now and in the future. These investments in infrastructure upgrades and expansion would create jobs, protect communities from disasters and help prepare us for changes in the climate. This effort would have several key elements:  First, given the new climate normal in which protracted hot, dry periods are far more common, we need to deploy technologies that can increase water supply. While expensive, energy-intensive desalination options have received considerable attention, wastewater recycling technologies have improved to the point that clean, safe water can now be delivered at reduced energy cost and can even be an energy source by using the organic matter in wastewater to produce energy. Investments in infrastructure to capture, store and clean urban storm water will also create new sources of water supply.

830085e7	"Global warming could be far worse than predicted, new study suggests  Show Caption Hide Caption US temperatures rise over last three decades Temperatures across the United States are up 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 30 years. In Salida, Colorado, residents have noticed the change through more lawn watering, increased air conditioning sales and bigger fires. (June 18) AP  Collapsing polar ice caps, a green Sahara Desert, a 20-foot sea-level rise.  That's the potential future of Earth, a new study suggests, noting that global warming could be twice as warm as current climate models predict.  The rate of warming is also remarkable: “The changes we see today are much faster than anything encountered in Earth’s history. In terms of rate of change, we are in uncharted waters,” said study co-author Katrin Meissner of the University of New South Wales in Australia.  This could mean the landmark Paris Climate Agreement – which seeks to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels – may not be enough to ward off catastrophe.  “Even with just 2 degrees of warming – and potentially just 1.5 degrees – significant impacts on the Earth system are profound,” said study co-author Alan Mix, a scientist from Oregon State University.  “We can expect that sea-level rise could become unstoppable for millennia, impacting much of the world’s population, infrastructure and economic activity,” Mix said.  In looking at Earth's past, scientists can predict what the future will look like. In the study, the researchers looked back at natural global warming periods over the past 3.5 million years and compared them to current man-made warming.  By combining a wide range of measurements from ice cores, sediment layers, fossil records, dating using atomic isotopes and many other established paleoclimate methods, the researchers pieced together the impact of those climatic changes.  Human-inflicted climate change is caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which release heat-trapping greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the the atmosphere.  Study lead author Hubertus Fischer of the University of Bern in Switzerland and his team found that our current climate predictions may underestimate long-term warming by as much as a factor of two.  Meissner said that ""climate models appear to be trustworthy for small changes, such as for low-emission scenarios over short periods, say over the next few decades out to 2100. But as the change gets larger or more persistent ... it appears they underestimate climate change.""  The research also revealed how large areas of the polar ice caps could collapse and significant changes to ecosystems could see the Sahara Desert become green and the edges of tropical forests turn into fire-dominated savanna.  However, Meissner said ""we cannot comment on how far in the future these changes will occur.""  Referring to the study findings, lead author Fischer said that without serious reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, there is ""very little margin for error to meet the Paris targets.”  The study, which was conducted by dozens of researchers from 17 countries, was published last week in Nature Geoscience, a peer-reviewed British journal."

82e146cc	It really is hard to overstate how screwed Florida is when it comes to climate change. Sea level rise has already ensured that floods are becoming common, not freak weather extremes; it’s guaranteeing that hurricanes and their associated storm surges are just getting that much more powerful.  Despite all this evidence, however, Governors and Senators who are often climate change deniers still get voted back into power there. As a result, instead of investing in climate change prevention measures, streets in Miami are literally getting raised up off the ground to stop floodwater coming in.  A new study, published in Geophysical Research Letters, suggests that even this ludicrously short-sighted measure won’t be enough to stop the incoming tide. Sea level rise around the globe is accelerating year-on-year, but along the Floridian coastline, it’s rising up three to six times faster than average.  A team of researchers from the University of Florida took into account a wide range of factors when it came to determining why this was happening. After all, regional sea level rise changes are very complex, and no single mechanism is solely to blame.  When it comes to human influence, there are two inputs: the melting ice caps, and thermal expansion. The former is obvious – terrestrial ice that melts, falls into the sea and disintegrates causes the sea level to rise first in the region, and then globally.  The latter relates to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; the more there is, the hotter the planet’s surface gets, and the hotter the oceans get. Warm water expands, and normally the only way to expand is upwards.  When it comes to natural cycles, sea level changes take place on short timescales normally because an oceanic current, one that shifts water from place to place, has changed. El Niño, the epic and all-encompassing climatic phenomenon that takes place every 2-7 years, can affect these oceanic currents.  This new study suggests that Florida’s sea level rise “hot spot” is being caused mostly by these natural factors. A recent, particularly powerful El Niño and a sudden weakening in the atmospheric pressure over the region - thanks to a feature known as the North Atlantic Oscillation - conspired to allow water levels to rise sharply.  “The superposition of these two ocean-atmospheric processes accounts for 87% of the variance in the spatiotemporal pattern of intradecadal sea level oscillations,” the team note – meaning that by far, natural processes are responsible for this unusual hot spot of sea level rise.  It cannot be ignored, though, that human contributions to climate change are only exacerbating this further. All in all, it’s bad news for Florida’s near-future, which is set to be underwater faster than anyone has previously estimated.  Another study revealed that, by 2100, there will be 2 billion climate refugees – and several million of them will be migrating from Florida to places further inland. If that’s not the future you want, it’s probably best to vote for lawmakers who’ll do something about it.  [H/T: Scientific American]  Update: Roll of North Atlantic Oscillation made more explicit.

b509780b	California Governor Jerry Brown blamed climate change for the California fires that have devastated the state this fall during a visit to assess the damage in Ventura County on Saturday.  “This is the new normal,” he said, as quoted by the Orange County Register. “We’re facing a new reality where fires threaten peoples’ lives, their properties, their neighborhoods and cost billions and billions of dollars. We have to have the resources to combat the fires, and also have to invest in managing our vegetation and forests and all the ways we dwell in this very wonderful place — but a place that’s getting hotter.”  However, climate scientists are more skeptical, noting that climate change could be one of a variety of factors.  A comprehensive look at the question by Southern California Public Radio — hardly a conservative outlet — found that there was considerable debate about the factors that made this year’s fires particularly bad.  One factor was high winds, whose connection to climate change is “still up for debate.” Another factor was the state’s recent drought, which persisted in the part of Southern California where the Thomas fire — now in excess of 150,000 acres, with only 15% containment — struck. (Ironically, last winter’s heavy rains caused brush to grow rapidly, giving fires plenty of fuel to burn.)  An important factor in the fires of the past week was that people are building homes in areas that are naturally prone to wildfires, or where naturally dry conditions mean that the kinds of building materials and vegetation that people prefer to use in cities and suburbs are a fire hazard.  Brown has frequently cited climate change as the cause for natural disasters before, only to be corrected by scientists, who suggested he was guilty of “noble-cause corruption” — i.e. distorting science in service of a cause that many scientists support.  Last year, both Brown and then-President Barack Obama falsely linked wildfires across the western United States to climate change. And last month, Brown told a conference at the Vatican that the world needed “brain washing” on climate change.  Aside from the Thomas fire, firefighters have made significant progress in their struggle against some of the other fires burning across the region. The Skirball fire near the 405 Freeway, which brought traffic to a standstill in Los Angeles on Thursday, was at 75 percent containment as of Saturday afternoon, according to Southern California Public Radio. The Lilac fire, which killed several dozen horses on Thursday, was fully contained by Saturday evening, according to the Register.  “The Creek Fire was now 80% contained, and the Rye Fire was 65% contained” as of Saturday, the Los Angeles Times reported.  Officials say there have been no deaths associated with the Southern California fires.  Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

d17185d3	Like what?  Helen Harwatt is a researcher trained in environmental nutrition, a field focused on developing food systems that balance human health and sustainability. She’s interested in policy, but realistic about how much progress can be expected under the aforementioned leadership. So she and colleagues have done research on maximizing the impacts of individuals. As with so many things in life and health, that tends to come down to food.  Recently Harwatt and a team of scientists from Oregon State University, Bard College, and Loma Linda University calculated just what would happen if every American made one dietary change: substituting beans for beef. They found that if everyone were willing and able to do that—hypothetically—the U.S. could still come close to meeting its 2020 greenhouse-gas emission goals, pledged by President Barack Obama in 2009.  That is, even if nothing about our energy infrastructure or transportation system changed—and even if people kept eating chicken and pork and eggs and cheese—this one dietary change could achieve somewhere between 46 and 74 percent of the reductions needed to meet the target.  “I think there’s genuinely a lack of awareness about how much impact this sort of change can have,” Harwatt told me. There have been analyses in the past about the environmental impacts of veganism and vegetarianism, but this study is novel for the idea that a person’s dedication to the cause doesn’t have to be complete in order to matter. A relatively small, single-food substitution could be the most powerful change a person makes in terms of their lifetime environmental impact—more so than downsizing one’s car, or being vigilant about turning off light bulbs, and certainly more than quitting showering.  Read: The economic case for worldwide vegetarianism  To understand why the climate impact of beef alone is so large, note that the image at the top of this story is a sea of soybeans in a silo in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. The beans belong to a feed lot that holds 38,000 cattle, the growth and fattening of which means dispensing 900 metric tons of feed every day. Which is to say that these beans will be eaten by cows, and the cows will convert the beans to meat, and the humans will eat the meat. In the process, the cows will emit much greenhouse gas, and they will consume far more calories in beans than they will yield in meat, meaning far more clearcutting of forests to farm cattle feed than would be necessary if the beans above were simply eaten by people.  This inefficient process happens on a massive scale. Brazil, the world’s largest exporter of red meat, holds around 212 million cattle. (In June, the U.S. temporarily suspended imports of beef from Brazil due to abscesses, collections of pus, in the meat.) According to the United Nations, 33 percent of arable land on Earth is used to grow feed for livestock. Even more, 26 percent of the ice-free terrestrial surface of Earth is used for grazing livestock. In all, almost a third of the land on Earth is used to produce meat and animal products.

USA TODAY  It was December 1984, and President Reagan had just been elected to his second term, Dynasty was the top show on TV and Madonna's Like a Virgin topped the musical charts.  It was also the last time the Earth had a cooler-than-average month.  Last month marked the planet's 400th consecutive month with above-average temperatures, federal scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Thursday.  The cause for the streak? Unquestionably, it’s climate change, caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels.  ""We live in and share a world that is unequivocally, appreciably and consequentially warmer than just a few decades ago, and our world continues to warm,"" said NOAA climate scientist Deke Arndt. ""Speeding by a '400' sign only underscores that, but it does not prove anything new.""  Climate scientists use the 20th-century average as a benchmark for global temperature measurements. That's because it's fixed in time, allowing for consistent ""goal posts"" when reviewing climate data. It's also a sufficiently long period to include several cycles of climate variability.  ""The thing that really matters is that, by whatever metric, we've spent every month for several decades on the warm side of any reasonable baseline,"" Arndt said.  NOAA's analysis found last month was the 3rd-warmest April on record globally. The unusual heat was most noteworthy in Europe, which had its warmest April on record, and Australia, which had its second-warmest.  Portions of Asia also experienced some extreme heat: In southern Pakistan, the town of Nawabshah soared to a scalding 122.4 degrees on April 30, which may have been the warmest April temperature on record for the globe, according to Meteo France.  Argentina also had its warmest April since national records began there in 1961.  North America was the one part of the world that didn't get in on the heat parade. Last month, the average U.S. temperature was 48.9 degrees, 2.2 degrees below average, ""making it the 13th-coldest April on record and the coldest since 1997,"" NOAA said.  More: Spring shiver: Last month was USA's coldest April in more than 20 years  More: Earth's carbon dioxide levels continue to soar, at highest point in 800,000 years  For the year-to-date, the Earth is seeing its 5th-warmest start to the year.  A separate analysis of global temperature data from NASA also found last month was the third-warmest April on record.  Another milestone was reached in April, also related to the number ""400"": Carbon dioxide — the gas scientists say is most responsible for global warming — reached its highest level in recorded history at 410 parts per million.  This amount is highest in at least the past 800,000 years, according to the Scripps Institute of Oceanography."

0a68da63	"Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has worst coral die-off ever  One of the world’s treasures, the Great Barrier Reef, just suffered from its worst coral die-off ever recorded, Australian scientists announced Monday.  Record coral kill-off on Great Barrier Reef Scientists confirm a mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef this year has killed more corals than ever before, with more than two thirds destroyed across large swathes of the biodiverse site. Video provided by AFP Newslook  Stress from unusually warm ocean water heated by man-made climate change and the natural El Niño climate pattern caused the die-off. ""The coral was cooked,” Terry Hughes, director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, told the BBC.  At more than 1,400 miles long, Australia's Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef and the planet's biggest structure made by living organisms. In the northernmost section of the reef, which had been considered the most ""pristine,"" some 67% of the coral died.  The good news, scientists said, was that central and southern sections of the reef fared far better, with ""only"" 6% and 1% of the coral dead, respectively.  Coral reefs result from the work of little polyps, creatures only a few millimeters long, budded on top of one another. Over centuries, the shells of these creatures combine to form the exotic shapes of coral reefs. Tiny differences in the anatomy of each polyp species affect the shape of their shells and produce the exotic shapes of each reef.  The vibrant colors that draw thousands of tourists to the Great Barrier Reef each year come from algae that live in the corals tissue. When water temperatures become too high, coral becomes stressed and expels the algae, which leave the coral a bleached white color.  Mass coral bleaching is a new phenomenon and was never observed before the 1980s as global warming ramped up.  Besides their beauty, reefs shelter land from storms, and are also a habitat for myriads of species.  ""Coral reefs are therefore the most biologically diverse ecosystems of the planet, and provide a number of ecosystem services that hundreds of millions of people rely on,"" said Greg Torda, also of the Centre, in an e-mail to USA TODAY.  ""These include provisioning (fishing, other types of harvesting, for pharmaceuticals, for example), coastal protection, aesthetic and cultural values – to name a few. If corals are lost, so are all the services they provide to humans; and so are all the species that directly or indirectly rely on them.""  Tourism on the Great Barrier Reef employs 70,000 people, and generates $5 billion (Australian) in income each year, the Centre said in a statement.  The good news is that much of the coral survived this bleaching event. But looking to the future, mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef will likely be an annual phenomenon within a decade, Torda said.  If all the coral died on the reef, “it would be among the largest mass extinction events in history,” said Torda."	Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has worst coral die-off ever	true
7fe3703e	Yet beyond its initial findings, the paper represents a major breakthrough for the field of climate economics. Previously, the best financial forecasts of climate change approximated damages for the entire country at once. This new study worked from the bottom up, building its model from dozens of microeconomic studies into how climate change is already affecting regional economies across the United States. Every algorithm in the model emerges from a previously observed relationship in real-world data.  “This is like the adults entering the room. Economists have, for a quarter century, insisted that more work needs to be done to estimate climate damages. This team has done so,” said Gernot Wagner, a researcher Harvard University and the former lead senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund, in an email. He was not connected to the study.  But this emphasis on the observed means that the research omitted many serious risks of climate change—even those the researchers considered important—if the data describing them was too paltry. The estimates do not include “non-market goods” like the loss of biodiversity or natural splendor. In other words: Most people agree that dead polar bears have an economic cost, but there’s no consensus on how to approximate it.  The study also doesn’t account for the increased likelihood of “tail risks”—that is, unlikely events with catastrophic consequences. Many researchers believe that global warming will make social strife, mass migration, or global military calamity more likely, but those events are, by definition, hard to predict. The same goes for economic disaster prompted by the onset of a “mega-drought” or the rapid collapse of the Greenland ice sheet.  “When we had the Dust Bowl, we saw everyone clear out of the Midwest and flood labor markets in the urban centers on the coast,” said Hsiang. Nothing like this kind of internal migration is modeled in the Science study.  All in all, the study’s assessments should be interpreted as the most rigorous attempt ever to describe what global warming will cost the United States in a “normal” world. It describes an America that has retained a well-organized economy, held together as a political community, and benefitted from the ongoing general global peace that began 70 years ago.  Even in that harmonious world, climate change will make the United States pay.  What Climate Change Will Cost Every U.S. County, 2080–2099  (Kopp, Hsiang, et al. / Science)  Across the country’s southern half—and especially in states that border the Gulf of Mexico—climate change could impose the equivalent of a 20-percent tax on county-level income, according to the study. Harvests will dwindle, summer energy costs will soar, rising seas will erase real-estate holdings, and heatwaves will set off epidemics of cardiac and pulmonary disease.

db830542	“This will become an important year for [anecdotes about] the importance of temperature. Despite the fact that these forests were really soaked down this winter and spring, these heat waves have dried things out enough to promote really large fires,” says Park Williams, a research scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.  In other words, the weeks of heat that baked the West in July and August were enough to wipe away some of the fire-dampening effect of the winter storms.  “The last 60 to 90 days have been exceptionally warm and dry, the perfect recipe for drying out fuels (the one ingredient besides ignitions you need for fire in these systems),” said John Abatzoglou, a professor of geography at the University of Idaho, in an email. “I was running a few numbers this morning, and the last 60 days have been record warm from Spokane, Washington, to Medford, Oregon; both Seattle and Missoula earlier this summer set records for the longest number of days without measurable rain.”  This excessive heat can have an outsize effect on the size of forest fires. For more than three decades, wildfire researchers have known that fire and aridity, which is controlled by heat, exist in an exponential relationship. Every degree of warming does more to promote fire than the previous degree of warming, Williams said.  “Now, thinking about temperature trends due to human-caused climate change, we think that the western United States is 1.5 [degrees] Celsius, or 3 degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than it would be in absence of climate change. And there’s a heat wave on top of that,” said Williams. “Because of the exponential influence of temperature, that means that this heat wave is having a way worse influence on fire than it would in absence of human-caused warming.”  In the runaway consequences of each additional degree of warming, wildfires are a “canary in the coal mine” for the effects of climate change, Williams said.  And global warming is already having an effect on wildfire. In a paper published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Williams and Abatzoglou found that the total area burned in the western United States over the past 33 years was double the size it would have been without any human-caused warming.  “The added forest fire area—due to just the degree and a half Celsius of warming—equaled the area of Massachusetts and Connecticut combined,” Williams told me.  Other researchers have arrived at similar conclusions. A paper published in Science last year found that “large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons.” The mid-1980s is also when most scientists argue that the effects of global warming began to be broadly felt.

Elizabeth Keatinge (@elizkeatinge) has more. Buzz60  There is now less sea ice on Earth than at any time on record. Ice in the Arctic and Antarctic melted to record low levels in January, scientists reported this week.  Sea ice is frozen ocean water that melts during the summer and refreezes in winter. It floats on top of the ocean.  Arctic sea ice this January averaged 5.17 million square miles, the lowest for the month in the 38-year sea ice record, the National Snow and Ice Data Center said.  That is 100,000 square miles less than the previous January record low set just last year.  #Arctic sea ice extent for January 2017 was the lowest January in the 38-yr satellite record. https://t.co/3pPss4vRVJ pic.twitter.com/Hcpb8rBrKo — NSIDC News (@NSIDC) February 7, 2017  January air temperatures climbed above average over nearly all of the Arctic Ocean, NASA said, continuing a pattern that started in fall.

At the bottom of the world, sea ice is also at all-time record low levels around Antarctica, the data center said. The lack of ice in the Antarctic, where it is currently summer, is most pronounced in the Amundsen Sea, where only a few scattered patches of ice remain.  Sea ice in the Arctic affects wildlife such as polar bears, seals and walruses. It also helps regulate the planet’s temperature by influencing the circulation of the atmosphere and ocean. It can affect weather in the U.S.  Sea ice extent in the Southern Hemisphere also tracked at record low levels for January 2017. #Antarctica https://t.co/3pPss4vRVJ pic.twitter.com/IKvLna3Ull — NSIDC News (@NSIDC) February 7, 2017  The amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic has steadily declined over the past few decades because of man-made global warming, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  ""Greenhouse gases emitted through human activities and the resulting increase in global mean temperatures are the most likely underlying cause of the sea ice decline,"" the snow and ice data center said.  Sea ice thickness also substantially declined in the latter half of the 20th century, the snow and ice data center said.  Antarctic ice fluctuates wildly year to year, and the link to man-made global warming there is not clear, NASA ice expert Walt Meier said.

b53ea62c	“Obviously, a single year, even if it is a record, cannot tell us much about climate trends,” said Stefan Rahmstorf, head of earth system analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “However, the fact that the warmest years on record are 2014, 2010 and 2005 clearly indicates that global warming has not ‘stopped in 1998,’ as some like to falsely claim.”  Such claims are unlikely to go away, though. John R. Christy, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville who is known for his skepticism about the seriousness of global warming, pointed out in an interview that 2014 had surpassed the other record-warm years by only a few hundredths of a degree, well within the error margin of global temperature measurements. “Since the end of the 20th century, the temperature hasn’t done much,” Dr. Christy said. “It’s on this kind of warmish plateau.”  Despite such arguments from a handful of scientists, the vast majority of those who study the climate say the earth is in a long-term warming trend that is profoundly threatening and caused almost entirely by human activity.  They expect the heat to get much worse over coming decades, but already it is killing forests around the world, driving plants and animals to extinction, melting land ice and causing the seas to rise at an accelerating pace.  “It is exceptionally unlikely that we would be witnessing a record year of warmth, during a record-warm decade, during a several decades-long period of warmth that appears to be unrivaled for more than a thousand years, were it not for the rising levels of planet-warming gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels,” Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist at the Pennsylvania State University, said in an email.  NASA and the other American agency that maintains long-term temperature records, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, issued separate data compilations on Friday that confirmed the 2014 record. A Japanese agency had released preliminary information in early January showing 2014 as the warmest year.

So now we’re dedicating a series to help you escape. We’ll be revisiting our most popular features from the last three years in our Lockdown Longreads.  You’ll find everything from the story about the world’s greatest space mission to the truth about whether our cats really love us, the epic hunt to bring illegal fishermen to justice and the small team which brings long-buried World War Two tanks back to life. What you won’t find is any reference to, well, you-know-what. Enjoy.  The first time my father’s basement flooded, it was shortly after he moved in. The building was an ocean-front high-rise in a small city north of Miami called Sunny Isles Beach. The marble lobby had a waterfall that never stopped running; crisp-shirted valets parked your car for you. For the residents who lived in the more lavish flats, these cars were often BMWs and Mercedes. But no matter their value, the cars all wound up in the same place: the basement.  When I called, I’d ask my dad how the building was doing. “The basement flooded again a couple weeks ago,” he’d sometimes say. Or: “It’s getting worse.” It’s not only his building: he’s also driven through a foot of water on a main road a couple of towns over and is used to tiptoeing around pools in the local supermarket’s car park.  Ask nearly anyone in the Miami area about flooding and they’ll have an anecdote to share. Many will also tell you that it’s happening more and more frequently. The data backs them up.  It’s easy to think that the only communities suffering from sea level rise are far-flung and remote. And while places like the Solomon Islands and Kiribati are indeed facing particularly dramatic challenges, they aren’t the only ones being forced to grapple with the issue. Sea levels are rising around the world, and in the US, south Florida is ground zero – as much for the adaptation strategies it is attempting as for the risk that it bears.

f4f3e803	Pakistani singer Meesha Shafi now faces up to 3 years in prison for levelling false accusations of sexual harassment against actor-singer Ali Zafar, who has also done extensive work in Bollywood. As per a report, post Ali Zafar's defamation case against Meesha, a Pakistani Court has awarded 3 years of jail term to Meesha for causing 'irreparable damages to his career thanks to the false case'. Ali has been fighting this prolonged battle since 2018 now after Meesha levelled the allegations at him around the time the #MeToo movement was gaining momentum everywhere in the world. Meesha, however, is not at all happy with the judgement. She apparently told an international portal, 'Which woman has got justice in a case of this nature and at what cost?'. Meesha, at the time of accusing Ali, had said, 'I have been subjected, on more than one occasion, to sexual harassment of a physical nature at the hands of a colleague from my industry: Ali Zafar. These incidences did not happen when I was young, or just entering the industry. This happened to me even though I am an empowered, accomplished woman who is known for speaking her mind! This happened to me as a mother of two children.' Ali in a long statement categorically denied all allegations by issuing a statement. The 'Mere Brother Ki Dulhan' actor filed a defamation case against Meesha along with eight other people who accused him. Meanwhile, her lawyers are set to challenge the charge against her. While denying all allegations, Zafar had penned, 'I categorically deny all claims of harassment lodged against me by Ms Shafi. I intend to take this through the courts of law and to address this professionally and seriously rather than to lodge any allegations here, contesting personal vendettas on social media and in turn disrespecting the movement, my family, the industry and my fans. Ultimately I am a strong believer that the truth, always prevails.'	Pakistani singer Meesha Shafi faces 3 years in jail for falsely accusing Ali Zafar of sexual harassment	false
a9bebdd3	Much of recent global warming has been fabricated by climate scientists to make it look more frightening, a study has found.  The peer-reviewed study by two scientists and a veteran statistician looked at the global average temperature datasets (GAST) which are used by climate alarmists to argue that recent years have been “the hottest evah” and that the warming of the last 120 years has been dramatic and unprecedented.  What they found is that these readings are “totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data.”  That is, the adjusted data used by alarmist organizations like NASA, NOAA, and the UK Met Office differs so markedly from the original raw data that it cannot be trusted.  This chart gives you a good idea of the direction of the adjustments.  The blue bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted downwards to make it cooler; the red bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted upwards to make it warmer.  Note how most of the downward adjustments take place in the early twentieth century and most of the upward take place in the late twentieth century.  According to meteorologist Joe D’Aleo, who co-authored the study with statistician James Wallace and Cato Institute climate scientist Craig Idso, this has the effect of exaggerating the warming trend:  “Nearly all of the warming they are now showing are in the adjustments.” “Each dataset pushed down the 1940s warming and pushed up the current warming.” “You would think that when you make adjustments you’d sometimes get warming and sometimes get cooling. That’s almost never happened.”  What this means, the report concludes, is that claims by NASA, NOAA, and the UK Met Office that the world is experiencing unprecedented and dramatic warming should be taken with a huge pinch of salt: they all use the same corrupted global average temperature (GAST) data.

903d335b	For decades, most scientists saw climate change as a distant prospect. We now know that thinking was wrong. This summer, for instance, a heat wave in Europe penetrated the Arctic, pushing temperatures into the 80s across much of the Far North and, according to the Belgian climate scientist Xavier Fettweis, melting some 40 billion tons of Greenland’s ice sheet.  Had a scientist in the early 1990s suggested that within 25 years a single heat wave would measurably raise sea levels, at an estimated two one-hundredths of an inch, bake the Arctic and produce Sahara-like temperatures in Paris and Berlin, the prediction would have been dismissed as alarmist. But many worst-case scenarios from that time are now realities.  Science is a process of discovery. It can move slowly as the pieces of a puzzle fall together and scientists refine their investigative tools. But in the case of climate, this deliberation has been accompanied by inertia born of bureaucratic caution and politics. A recent essay in Scientific American argued that scientists “tend to underestimate the severity of threats and the rapidity with which they might unfold” and said one of the reasons was “the perceived need for consensus.” This has had severe consequences, diluting what should have been a sense of urgency and vastly understating the looming costs of adaptation and dislocation as the planet continues to warm.  In 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations group of thousands of scientists representing 195 countries, said in its first report that climate change would arrive at a stately pace, that the methane-laden Arctic permafrost was not in danger of thawing, and that the Antarctic ice sheets were stable.

77d253bc	Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.  INCHEON, South Korea — A landmark report from the United Nations’ scientific panel on climate change paints a far more dire picture of the immediate consequences of climate change than previously thought and says that avoiding the damage requires transforming the world economy at a speed and scale that has “no documented historic precedent.”  The report, issued on Monday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists convened by the United Nations to guide world leaders, describes a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires, and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040 — a period well within the lifetime of much of the global population.  The report “is quite a shock, and quite concerning,” said Bill Hare, an author of previous I.P.C.C. reports and a physicist with Climate Analytics, a nonprofit organization. “We were not aware of this just a few years ago.” The report was the first to be commissioned by world leaders under the Paris agreement, the 2015 pact by nations to fight global warming.  The authors found that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate, the atmosphere will warm up by as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels by 2040, inundating coastlines and intensifying droughts and poverty. Previous work had focused on estimating the damage if average temperatures were to rise by a larger number, 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius), because that was the threshold scientists previously considered for the most severe effects of climate change.

e8a7c497	El Niño has now ended, and climate scientists almost universally expect 2017 to be cooler than the year before. But the scale of the heat burst has been startling to many of the experts, and some of them fear an accelerated era of global warming could be at hand over the next few years.  Even at current temperatures, billions of tons of land ice are melting or sliding into the ocean. The sea is also absorbing most of the heat trapped by human emissions. Those factors are causing the ocean to rise at what appears to be an accelerating pace, and coastal communities in the United States are beginning to spend billions to fight increased tidal flooding. Their pleas for help from Congress have largely been ignored.  The finding that a record had been set for the third year in a row was released on Wednesday by three government agencies, two of them American and one British, that track measurements made by ships, buoys and land-based weather stations. They analyze the figures to correct for known problems, producing an annual average temperature for the surface of the Earth. The national meteorological agency of Japan confirmed the findings in a preliminary analysis.  In the British data set, 2016 set a record by only a small amount; the margin was larger in the NOAA data set and larger still in NASA’s. NASA does more work than the other groups to take full account of Arctic temperatures, and several scientists said they believed the NASA record to be the most accurate for 2016 for that reason.

c32f210d	"Story highlights It's a key indicator of climate change and can mean changes to weather  Temperatures are 30 degrees above normal at the North Pole  (CNN) For what appears to be the first time since scientists began keeping track, sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic are at record lows this time of year.  ""It looks like, since the beginning of October, that for the first time we are seeing both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice running at record low levels,"" said Walt Meier, a research scientist with the Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, who has tracked sea ice data going back to 1979.  While record low sea ice is nothing new in the Arctic, this is a surprising turn of events for the Antarctic. Even as sea ice in the Arctic has seen a rapid and consistent decline over the past decade, its counterpart in the Southern Hemisphere has seen its extent increasing.  In fact, each year from 2012 through 2014 reached a record high for Antarctic sea ice extent. Skeptics have long pointed to ice gain in the Southern Hemisphere as evidence climate change wasn't occurring, but scientists warned that it was caused by natural variations and circulations in the atmosphere.  While it is too early to know if the recent, rapid decline in Antarctic sea ice is going to be a regular occurrence like in the Arctic, it ""certainly puts the kibosh on everyone saying that Antarctica's ice is just going up and up,"" Meier said.

4d9c4db8	Though these types of floods often produce only a foot or two of standing saltwater, they are straining life in many towns by killing lawns and trees, blocking neighborhood streets and clogging storm drains, polluting supplies of freshwater and sometimes stranding entire island communities for hours by overtopping the roads that tie them to the mainland.  Such events are just an early harbinger of the coming damage, the new research suggests.  “I think we need a new way to think about most coastal flooding,” said Benjamin H. Strauss, the primary author of one of two related studies released on Monday. “It’s not the tide. It’s not the wind. It’s us. That’s true for most of the coastal floods we now experience.”  In the second study, scientists reconstructed the level of the sea over time and confirmed that it is most likely rising faster than at any point in 28 centuries, with the rate of increase growing sharply over the past century — largely, they found, because of the warming that scientists have said is almost certainly caused by human emissions.  They also confirmed previous forecasts that if emissions were to continue at a high rate over the next few decades, the ocean could rise as much as three or four feet by 2100.  Experts say the situation would then grow far worse in the 22nd century and beyond, likely requiring the abandonment of many coastal cities.	Seas Are Rising at Fastest Rate in Last 28 Centuries	true
0cd33125	The devil’s in those 1,722 pages of detail  I leave it to others to speculate on whether, in Theresa May’s Downing Street outburst against Brussels she was “speaking for England”, or had gone off her head. But one leaked detail of her dinner the previous week with Jean‑Claude Juncker and the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is worth dwelling on.  To remind Mrs May of just what she and the EU are up against in the next 18 months, Juncker was said to have plonked on the table two documents, the EU’s trade deal with Canada and the EU’s accession treaty with Croatia in 2011.  Both are very relevant to our concerns, because Mrs May not only hopes to negotiate an unprecedented trade deal: at the end of the negotiations, there will also have to be a secession treaty, covering much of the same ground as an accession treaty, but in reverse.  The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), which gave Canada much less access to the European market than we enjoy now, is incredibly complex, covered 1,598 pages and took seven years to negotiate. The Croatia treaty, like any accession treaty, had to cover 35 “chapters” or policy areas, only six of which refer to trade; and was again extremely complex, filling 124 pages, which took six years to agree.

5ece0400	Story highlights Global sea level is on the rise at an increasing rate, according to a new study  By the end of the century, it could rise another 2 feet  (CNN) Sea level rise is happening now, and the rate at which it is rising is increasing every year, according to a study released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  Researchers, led by University of Colorado-Boulder professor of aerospace engineering sciences Steve Nerem, used satellite data dating to 1993 to observe the levels of the world's oceans.  Changes in sea level observed between 1992 and 2014. Orange/red colors represent higher sea levels, while blue colors show where sea levels are lower.  Using satellite data rather than tide-gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level, since it provides measurements of the open ocean.  The team observed a total rise in the ocean of 7 centimeters (2.8 inches) in 25 years of data, which aligns with the generally accepted current rate of sea level rise of about 3 millimeters (0.1 inches) per year.  But that rate is not constant.  Read More	Observations show sea levels rising, and climate change is accelerating it	true

ed80c4ba	After a season that saw temperatures soar at the North Pole, the Arctic has less sea ice at winter’s end than ever before in nearly four decades of satellite measurements.  The extent of ice cover — a record low for the third straight year — is another indicator of the effects of global warming on the Arctic, a region that is among the hardest hit by climate change, scientists said.  “This is just another exclamation point on the overall loss of Arctic sea ice coverage that we’ve been seeing,” said Mark Serreze, the director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, a government-backed research agency in Boulder, Colo. “We’re heading for summers with no sea ice coverage at all.”  Dr. Serreze said that such a situation, which would leave nothing but open ocean in summer until fall freeze-up begins, could occur by 2030, although many scientists say it may not happen for a decade or two after that.

2be7d485	The impact of humans on Earth is unparalleled, with scientists arguing our actions have tipped the planet into a new era - the Anthropocene - with fallout from nuclear bombs now written into the rocks beneath our feet, and species facing extinction at 1,000 times the usual rate.  Yet global warming could turn out to be the most devastating consequence of human progress. If temperatures continue to increase, experts forecast catastrophic sea level rises, a surge in hurricanes and cyclones, the spread of lethal disease, drought, famine and deadly heatwaves.  But does the science back up these claims? Is carbon dioxide primarily to blame or could there be other causes? What role do the Sun, clouds and the oceans play?

62682d8e	1. “LAUDATO SI’, mi’ Signore” – “Praise be to you, my Lord”. In the words of this beautiful canticle, Saint Francis of Assisi reminds us that our common home is like a sister with whom we share our life and a beautiful mother who opens her arms to embrace us. “Praise be to you, my Lord, through our Sister, Mother Earth, who sustains and governs us, and who produces various fruit with coloured flowers and herbs”.[1] 2. This sister now cries out to us because of the harm we have inflicted on her by our irresponsible use and abuse of the goods with which God has endowed her. We have come to see ourselves as her lords and masters, entitled to plunder her at will. The violence present in our hearts, wounded by sin, is also reflected in the symptoms of sickness evident in the soil, in the water, in the air and in all forms of life. This is why the earth herself, burdened and laid waste, is among the most abandoned and maltreated of our poor; she “groans in travail” (Rom 8:22). We have forgotten that we ourselves are dust of the earth (cf. Gen 2:7); our very bodies are made up of her elements, we breathe her air and we receive life and refreshment from her waters. Nothing in this world is indifferent to us 3. More than fifty years ago, with the world teetering on the brink of nuclear crisis, Pope Saint John XXIII wrote an Encyclical which not only rejected war but offered a proposal for peace. He addressed his message Pacem in Terris to the entire “Catholic world” and indeed “to all men and women of good will”. Now, faced as we are with global environmental deterioration, I wish to address every person living on this planet. In my Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Gaudium, I wrote to all the members of the Church with the aim of encouraging ongoing missionary renewal. In this Encyclical, I would like to enter into dialogue with all people about our common home. 4. In 1971, eight years after Pacem in Terris, Blessed Pope Paul VI referred to the ecological concern as “a tragic consequence” of unchecked human activity: “Due to an ill-considered exploitation of nature, humanity runs the risk of destroying it and becoming in turn a victim of this degradation”.[2] He spoke in similar terms to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations about the potential for an “ecological catastrophe under the effective explosion of industrial civilization”, and stressed “the urgent need for a radical change in the conduct of humanity”, inasmuch as “the most extraordinary scientific advances, the most amazing technical abilities, the most astonishing economic growth, unless they are accompanied by authentic social and moral progress, will definitively turn against man”.[3] 5. Saint John Paul II became increasingly concerned about this issue. In his first Encyclical he warned that human beings frequently seem “to see no other meaning in their natural environment than what serves for immediate use and consumption”.[4] Subsequently, he would call for a global ecological conversion.[5] At the same time, he noted that little effort had been made to “safeguard the moral conditions for an authentic human ecology”.[6] The destruction of the human environment is extremely serious, not only because God has entrusted the world to us men and women, but because human life is itself a gift which must be defended from various forms of debasement. Every effort to protect and improve our world entails profound changes in “lifestyles, models of production and consumption, and the established structures of power which today govern societies”.[7] Authentic human development has a moral character. It presumes full respect for the human person, but it must also be concerned for the world around us and “take into account the nature of each being and of its mutual connection in an ordered system”.[8] Accordingly, our human ability to transform reality must proceed in line with God’s original gift of all that is.[9] 6. My predecessor Benedict XVI likewise proposed “eliminating the structural causes of the dysfunctions of the world economy and correcting models of growth which have proved incapable of ensuring respect for the environment”.[10] He observed that the world cannot be analyzed by isolating only one of its aspects, since “the book of nature is one and indivisible”, and includes the environment, life, sexuality, the family, social relations, and so forth. It follows that “the deterioration of nature is closely connected to the culture which shapes human coexistence”.[11] Pope Benedict asked us to recognize that the natural environment has been gravely damaged by our irresponsible behaviour. The social environment has also suffered damage. Both are ultimately due to the same evil: the notion that there are no indisputable truths to guide our lives, and hence human freedom is limitless. We have forgotten that “man is not only a freedom which he creates for himself. Man does not create himself. He is spirit and will, but also nature”.[12] With paternal concern, Benedict urged us to realize that creation is harmed “where we ourselves have the final word, where everything is simply our property and we use it for ourselves alone. The misuse of creation begins when we no longer recognize any higher instance than ourselves, when we see nothing else but ourselves”.[13] United by the same concern 7. These statements of the Popes echo the reflections of numerous scientists, philosophers, theologians and civic groups, all of which have enriched the Church’s thinking on these questions. Outside the Catholic Church, other Churches and Christian communities – and other religions as well – have expressed deep concern and offered valuable reflections on issues which all of us find disturbing. To give just one striking example, I would mention the statements made by the beloved Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, with whom we share the hope of full ecclesial communion. 8. Patriarch Bartholomew has spoken in particular of the need for each of us to repent of the ways we have harmed the planet, for “inasmuch as we all generate small ecological damage”, we are called to acknowledge “our contribution, smaller or greater, to the disfigurement and destruction of creation”.[14] He has repeatedly stated this firmly and persuasively, challenging us to acknowledge our sins against creation: “For human beings… to destroy the biological diversity of God’s creation; for human beings to degrade the integrity of the earth by causing changes in its climate, by stripping the earth of its natural forests or destroying its wetlands; for human beings to contaminate the earth’s waters, its land, its air, and its life – these are sins”.[15] For “to commit a crime against the natural world is a sin against ourselves and a sin against God”.[16] 9. At the same time, Bartholomew has drawn attention to the ethical and spiritual roots of environmental problems, which require that we look for solutions not only in technology but in a change of humanity; otherwise we would be dealing merely with symptoms. He asks us to replace consumption with sacrifice, greed with generosity, wastefulness with a spirit of sharing, an asceticism which “entails learning to give, and not simply to give up. It is a way of loving, of moving gradually away from what I want to what God’s world needs. It is liberation from fear, greed and compulsion”.[17] As Christians, we are also called “to accept the world as a sacrament of communion, as a way of sharing with God and our neighbours on a global scale. It is our humble conviction that the divine and the human meet in the slightest detail in the seamless garment of God’s creation, in the last speck of dust of our planet”.[18] Saint Francis of Assisi 10. I do not want to write this Encyclical without turning to that attractive and compelling figure, whose name I took as my guide and inspiration when I was elected Bishop of Rome. I believe that Saint Francis is the example par excellence of care for the vulnerable and of an integral ecology lived out joyfully and authentically. He is the patron saint of all who study and work in the area of ecology, and he is also much loved by non-Christians. He was particularly concerned for God’s creation and for the poor and outcast. He loved, and was deeply loved for his joy, his generous self-giving, his openheartedness. He was a mystic and a pilgrim who lived in simplicity and in wonderful harmony with God, with others, with nature and with himself. He shows us just how inseparable the bond is between concern for nature, justice for the poor, commitment to society, and interior peace. 11. Francis helps us to see that an integral ecology calls for openness to categories which transcend the language of mathematics and biology, and take us to the heart of what it is to be human. Just as happens when we fall in love with someone, whenever he would gaze at the sun, the moon or the smallest of animals, he burst into song, drawing all other creatures into his praise. He communed with all creation, even preaching to the flowers, inviting them “to praise the Lord, just as if they were endowed with reason”.[19] His response to the world around him was so much more than intellectual appreciation or economic calculus, for to him each and every creature was a sister united to him by bonds of affection. That is why he felt called to care for all that exists. His disciple Saint Bonaventure tells us that, “from a reflection on the primary source of all things, filled with even more abundant piety, he would call creatures, no matter how small, by the name of ‘brother’ or ‘sister’”.[20] Such a conviction cannot be written off as naive romanticism, for it affects the choices which determine our behaviour. If we approach nature and the environment without this openness to awe and wonder, if we no longer speak the language of fraternity and beauty in our relationship with the world, our attitude will be that of masters, consumers, ruthless exploiters, unable to set limits on their immediate needs. By contrast, if we feel intimately united with all that exists, then sobriety and care will well up spontaneously. The poverty and austerity of Saint Francis were no mere veneer of asceticism, but something much more radical: a refusal to turn reality into an object simply to be used and controlled. 12. What is more, Saint Francis, faithful to Scripture, invites us to see nature as a magnificent book in which God speaks to us and grants us a glimpse of his infinite beauty and goodness. “Through the greatness and the beauty of creatures one comes to know by analogy their maker” (Wis 13:5); indeed, “his eternal power and divinity have been made known through his works since the creation of the world” (Rom 1:20). For this reason, Francis asked that part of the friary garden always be left untouched, so that wild flowers and herbs could grow there, and those who saw them could raise their minds to God, the Creator of such beauty.[21] Rather than a problem to be solved, the world is a joyful mystery to be contemplated with gladness and praise. My appeal 13. The urgent challenge to protect our common home includes a concern to bring the whole human family together to seek a sustainable and integral development, for we know that things can change. The Creator does not abandon us; he never forsakes his loving plan or repents of having created us. Humanity still has the ability to work together in building our common home. Here I want to recognize, encourage and thank all those striving in countless ways to guarantee the protection of the home which we share. Particular appreciation is owed to those who tirelessly seek to resolve the tragic effects of environmental degradation on the lives of the world’s poorest. Young people demand change. They wonder how anyone can claim to be building a better future without thinking of the environmental crisis and the sufferings of the excluded. 14. I urgently appeal, then, for a new dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet. We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all. The worldwide ecological movement has already made considerable progress and led to the establishment of numerous organizations committed to raising awareness of these challenges. Regrettably, many efforts to seek concrete solutions to the environmental crisis have proved ineffective, not only because of powerful opposition but also because of a more general lack of interest. Obstructionist attitudes, even on the part of believers, can range from denial of the problem to indifference, nonchalant resignation or blind confidence in technical solutions. We require a new and universal solidarity. As the bishops of Southern Africa have stated: “Everyone’s talents and involvement are needed to redress the damage caused by human abuse of God’s creation”. [22] All of us can cooperate as instruments of God for the care of creation, each according to his or her own culture, experience, involvements and talents. 15. It is my hope that this Encyclical Letter, which is now added to the body of the Church’s social teaching, can help us to acknowledge the appeal, immensity and urgency of the challenge we face. I will begin by briefly reviewing several aspects of the present ecological crisis, with the aim of drawing on the results of the best scientific research available today, letting them touch us deeply and provide a concrete foundation for the ethical and spiritual itinerary that follows. I will then consider some principles drawn from the Judaeo-Christian tradition which can render our commitment to the environment more coherent. I will then attempt to get to the roots of the present situation, so as to consider not only its symptoms but also its deepest causes. This will help to provide an approach to ecology which respects our unique place as human beings in this world and our relationship to our surroundings. In light of this reflection, I will advance some broader proposals for dialogue and action which would involve each of us as individuals, and also affect international policy. Finally, convinced as I am that change is impossible without motivation and a process of education, I will offer some inspired guidelines for human development to be found in the treasure of Christian spiritual experience. 16. Although each chapter will have its own subject and specific approach, it will also take up and re-examine important questions previously dealt with. This is particularly the case with a number of themes which will reappear as the Encyclical unfolds. As examples, I will point to the intimate relationship between the poor and the fragility of the planet, the conviction that everything in the world is connected, the critique of new paradigms and forms of power derived from technology, the call to seek other ways of understanding the economy and progress, the value proper to each creature, the human meaning of ecology, the need for forthright and honest debate, the serious responsibility of international and local policy, the throwaway culture and the proposal of a new lifestyle. These questions will not be dealt with once and for all, but reframed and enriched again and again. CHAPTER ONE WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR COMMON HOME 17. Theological and philosophical reflections on the situation of humanity and the world can sound tiresome and abstract, unless they are grounded in a fresh analysis of our present situation, which is in many ways unprecedented in the history of humanity. So, before considering how faith brings new incentives and requirements with regard to the world of which we are a part, I will briefly turn to what is happening to our common home. 18. The continued acceleration of changes affecting humanity and the planet is coupled today with a more intensified pace of life and work which might be called “rapidification”. Although change is part of the working of complex systems, the speed with which human activity has developed contrasts with the naturally slow pace of biological evolution. Moreover, the goals of this rapid and constant change are not necessarily geared to the common good or to integral and sustainable human development. Change is something desirable, yet it becomes a source of anxiety when it causes harm to the world and to the quality of life of much of humanity. 19. Following a period of irrational confidence in progress and human abilities, some sectors of society are now adopting a more critical approach. We see increasing sensitivity to the environment and the need to protect nature, along with a growing concern, both genuine and distressing, for what is happening to our planet. Let us review, however cursorily, those questions which are troubling us today and which we can no longer sweep under the carpet. Our goal is not to amass information or to satisfy curiosity, but rather to become painfully aware, to dare to turn what is happening to the world into our own personal suffering and thus to discover what each of us can do about it. I. POLLUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE Pollution, waste and the throwaway culture 20. Some forms of pollution are part of people’s daily experience. Exposure to atmospheric pollutants produces a broad spectrum of health hazards, especially for the poor, and causes millions of premature deaths. People take sick, for example, from breathing high levels of smoke from fuels used in cooking or heating. There is also pollution that affects everyone, caused by transport, industrial fumes, substances which contribute to the acidification of soil and water, fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides and agrotoxins in general. Technology, which, linked to business interests, is presented as the only way of solving these problems, in fact proves incapable of seeing the mysterious network of relations between things and so sometimes solves one problem only to create others. 21. Account must also be taken of the pollution produced by residue, including dangerous waste present in different areas. Each year hundreds of millions of tons of waste are generated, much of it non-biodegradable, highly toxic and radioactive, from homes and businesses, from construction and demolition sites, from clinical, electronic and industrial sources. The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth. In many parts of the planet, the elderly lament that once beautiful landscapes are now covered with rubbish. Industrial waste and chemical products utilized in cities and agricultural areas can lead to bioaccumulation in the organisms of the local population, even when levels of toxins in those places are low. Frequently no measures are taken until after people’s health has been irreversibly affected. 22. These problems are closely linked to a throwaway culture which affects the excluded just as it quickly reduces things to rubbish. To cite one example, most of the paper we produce is thrown away and not recycled. It is hard for us to accept that the way natural ecosystems work is exemplary: plants synthesize nutrients which feed herbivores; these in turn become food for carnivores, which produce significant quantities of organic waste which give rise to new generations of plants. But our industrial system, at the end of its cycle of production and consumption, has not developed the capacity to absorb and reuse waste and by-products. We have not yet managed to adopt a circular model of production capable of preserving resources for present and future generations, while limiting as much as possible the use of non-renewable resources, moderating their consumption, maximizing their efficient use, reusing and recycling them. A serious consideration of this issue would be one way of counteracting the throwaway culture which affects the entire planet, but it must be said that only limited progress has been made in this regard. Climate as a common good 23. The climate is a common good, belonging to all and meant for all. At the global level, it is a complex system linked to many of the essential conditions for human life. A very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic system. In recent decades this warming has been accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and, it would appear, by an increase of extreme weather events, even if a scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned to each particular phenomenon. Humanity is called to recognize the need for changes of lifestyle, production and consumption, in order to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it. It is true that there are other factors (such as volcanic activity, variations in the earth’s orbit and axis, the solar cycle), yet a number of scientific studies indicate that most global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly as a result of human activity. As these gases build up in the atmosphere, they hamper the escape of heat produced by sunlight at the earth’s surface. The problem is aggravated by a model of development based on the intensive use of fossil fuels, which is at the heart of the worldwide energy system. Another determining factor has been an increase in changed uses of the soil, principally deforestation for agricultural purposes. 24. Warming has effects on the carbon cycle. It creates a vicious circle which aggravates the situation even more, affecting the availability of essential resources like drinking water, energy and agricultural production in warmer regions, and leading to the extinction of part of the planet’s biodiversity. The melting in the polar ice caps and in high altitude plains can lead to the dangerous release of methane gas, while the decomposition of frozen organic material can further increase the emission of carbon dioxide. Things are made worse by the loss of tropical forests which would otherwise help to mitigate climate change. Carbon dioxide pollution increases the acidification of the oceans and compromises the marine food chain. If present trends continue, this century may well witness extraordinary climate change and an unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequences for all of us. A rise in the sea level, for example, can create extremely serious situations, if we consider that a quarter of the world’s population lives on the coast or nearby, and that the majority of our megacities are situated in coastal areas. 25. Climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods. It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day. Its worst impact will probably be felt by developing countries in coming decades. Many of the poor live in areas particularly affected by phenomena related to warming, and their means of subsistence are largely dependent on natural reserves and ecosystemic services such as agriculture, fishing and forestry. They have no other financial activities or resources which can enable them to adapt to climate change or to face natural disasters, and their access to social services and protection is very limited. For example, changes in climate, to which animals and plants cannot adapt, lead them to migrate; this in turn affects the livelihood of the poor, who are then forced to leave their homes, with great uncertainty for their future and that of their children. There has been a tragic rise in the number of migrants seeking to flee from the growing poverty caused by environmental degradation. They are not recognized by international conventions as refugees; they bear the loss of the lives they have left behind, without enjoying any legal protection whatsoever. Sadly, there is widespread indifference to such suffering, which is even now taking place throughout our world. Our lack of response to these tragedies involving our brothers and sisters points to the loss of that sense of responsibility for our fellow men and women upon which all civil society is founded. 26. Many of those who possess more resources and economic or political power seem mostly to be concerned with masking the problems or concealing their symptoms, simply making efforts to reduce some of the negative impacts of climate change. However, many of these symptoms indicate that such effects will continue to worsen if we continue with current models of production and consumption. There is an urgent need to develop policies so that, in the next few years, the emission of carbon dioxide and other highly polluting gases can be drastically reduced, for example, substituting for fossil fuels and developing sources of renewable energy. Worldwide there is minimal access to clean and renewable energy. There is still a need to develop adequate storage technologies. Some countries have made considerable progress, although it is far from constituting a significant proportion. Investments have also been made in means of production and transportation which consume less energy and require fewer raw materials, as well as in methods of construction and renovating buildings which improve their energy efficiency. But these good practices are still far from widespread. II. THE ISSUE OF WATER 27. Other indicators of the present situation have to do with the depletion of natural resources. We all know that it is not possible to sustain the present level of consumption in developed countries and wealthier sectors of society, where the habit of wasting and discarding has reached unprecedented levels. The exploitation of the planet has already exceeded acceptable limits and we still have not solved the problem of poverty. 28. Fresh drinking water is an issue of primary importance, since it is indispensable for human life and for supporting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Sources of fresh water are necessary for health care, agriculture and industry. Water supplies used to be relatively constant, but now in many places demand exceeds the sustainable supply, with dramatic consequences in the short and long term. Large cities dependent on significant supplies of water have experienced periods of shortage, and at critical moments these have not always been administered with sufficient oversight and impartiality. Water poverty especially affects Africa where large sectors of the population have no access to safe drinking water or experience droughts which impede agricultural production. Some countries have areas rich in water while others endure drastic scarcity. 29. One particularly serious problem is the quality of water available to the poor. Every day, unsafe water results in many deaths and the spread of water-related diseases, including those caused by microorganisms and chemical substances. Dysentery and cholera, linked to inadequate hygiene and water supplies, are a significant cause of suffering and of infant mortality. Underground water sources in many places are threatened by the pollution produced in certain mining, farming and industrial activities, especially in countries lacking adequate regulation or controls. It is not only a question of industrial waste. Detergents and chemical products, commonly used in many places of the world, continue to pour into our rivers, lakes and seas. 30. Even as the quality of available water is constantly diminishing, in some places there is a growing tendency, despite its scarcity, to privatize this resource, turning it into a commodity subject to the laws of the market. Yet access to safe drinkable water is a basic and universal human right, since it is essential to human survival and, as such, is a condition for the exercise of other human rights. Our world has a grave social debt towards the poor who lack access to drinking water, because they are denied the right to a life consistent with their inalienable dignity. This debt can be paid partly by an increase in funding to provide clean water and sanitary services among the poor. But water continues to be wasted, not only in the developed world but also in developing countries which possess it in abundance. This shows that the problem of water is partly an educational and cultural issue, since there is little awareness of the seriousness of such behaviour within a context of great inequality. 31. Greater scarcity of water will lead to an increase in the cost of food and the various products which depend on its use. Some studies warn that an acute water shortage may occur within a few decades unless urgent action is taken. The environmental repercussions could affect billions of people; it is also conceivable that the control of water by large multinational businesses may become a major source of conflict in this century.[23] III. LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY 32. The earth’s resources are also being plundered because of short-sighted approaches to the economy, commerce and production. The loss of forests and woodlands entails the loss of species which may constitute extremely important resources in the future, not only for food but also for curing disease and other uses. Different species contain genes which could be key resources in years ahead for meeting human needs and regulating environmental problems. 33. It is not enough, however, to think of different species merely as potential “resources” to be exploited, while overlooking the fact that they have value in themselves. Each year sees the disappearance of thousands of plant and animal species which we will never know, which our children will never see, because they have been lost for ever. The great majority become extinct for reasons related to human activity. Because of us, thousands of species will no longer give glory to God by their very existence, nor convey their message to us. We have no such right. 34. It may well disturb us to learn of the extinction of mammals or birds, since they are more visible. But the good functioning of ecosystems also requires fungi, algae, worms, insects, reptiles and an innumerable variety of microorganisms. Some less numerous species, although generally unseen, nonetheless play a critical role in maintaining the equilibrium of a particular place. Human beings must intervene when a geosystem reaches a critical state. But nowadays, such intervention in nature has become more and more frequent. As a consequence, serious problems arise, leading to further interventions; human activity becomes ubiquitous, with all the risks which this entails. Often a vicious circle results, as human intervention to resolve a problem further aggravates the situation. For example, many birds and insects which disappear due to synthetic agrotoxins are helpful for agriculture: their disappearance will have to be compensated for by yet other techniques which may well prove harmful. We must be grateful for the praiseworthy efforts being made by scientists and engineers dedicated to finding solutions to man-made problems. But a sober look at our world shows that the degree of human intervention, often in the service of business interests and consumerism, is actually making our earth less rich and beautiful, ever more limited and grey, even as technological advances and consumer goods continue to abound limitlessly. We seem to think that we can substitute an irreplaceable and irretrievable beauty with something which we have created ourselves. 35. In assessing the environmental impact of any project, concern is usually shown for its effects on soil, water and air, yet few careful studies are made of its impact on biodiversity, as if the loss of species or animals and plant groups were of little importance. Highways, new plantations, the fencing-off of certain areas, the damming of water sources, and similar developments, crowd out natural habitats and, at times, break them up in such a way that animal populations can no longer migrate or roam freely. As a result, some species face extinction. Alternatives exist which at least lessen the impact of these projects, like the creation of biological corridors, but few countries demonstrate such concern and foresight. Frequently, when certain species are exploited commercially, little attention is paid to studying their reproductive patterns in order to prevent their depletion and the consequent imbalance of the ecosystem. 36. Caring for ecosystems demands far-sightedness, since no one looking for quick and easy profit is truly interested in their preservation. But the cost of the damage caused by such selfish lack of con	ENCYCLICAL LETTER LAUDATO SI’ OF THE HOLY FATHER FRANCIS ON CARE FOR OUR COMMON HOME	true
1393bc27	"I’m not sure the whole thing isn’t crazy, this climate change’ … environmentalist James Lovelock near his home on the Dorset coast. Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian Fracking is great, the green movement is a religion, his dire predictions about climate change were nonsense – and robots don’t mind the heat, so what does it matter? At 97, the creator of Gaia theory is as mischievous and subversive as ever James Lovelock’s parting words last time we met were: “Enjoy life while you can. Because if you’re lucky, it’s going to be 20 years before it hits the fan.” It was early 2008, and the distinguished scientist was predicting imminent and irreversible global warming, which would soon make large parts of the planet uninhabitably hot or put them underwater. The fashionable hope that windfarms or recycling could prevent global famine and mass migration was, he assured me, a fantasy; it was too late for ethical consumption to save us. Before the end of this century, 80% of the world’s population would be wiped out. His predictions were not easy to forget or dismiss. Sometimes described as a futurist, Lovelock has been Britain’s leading independent scientist for more than 50 years. His Gaia hypothesis, which contends that the earth is a single, self-regulating organism, is now accepted as the founding principle of most climate science, and his invention of a device to detect CFCs helped identify the hole in the ozone layer. A defiant generalist in an era of increasingly specialised study, and a mischievous provocateur, Lovelock is regarded by many as a scientific genius. James Lovelock speaking in 2014: ‘We should give up on saving the planet’ Guardian Eight years after our previous encounter, he appears to have aged not one bit. At 97, he’s conceived a beautifully illustrated book of essays described as a “tool kit for the future”, The Earth and I, and written the introduction and conclusion; he goes walking every day, his hearing is perfect, his focus forensic and his memory unimpaired. “Yes, why not? I’m writing a fiction book at the moment. It’s tremendous fun, you know.” He applies his holistic philosophy of science to his own health. “I’m a firm believer that if you don’t use it, you lose it – and if you do a lot of walking, and if you use your muscles quite a bit, your brain seems to work as well. You’ve got to look at the whole system, not just bits of it.” What has changed dramatically, however, is his position on climate change. He now says: “Anyone who tries to predict more than five to 10 years is a bit of an idiot, because so many things can change unexpectedly.” But isn’t that exactly what he did last time we met? “I know,” he grins teasingly. “But I’ve grown up a bit since then.” Lovelock now believes that “CO2 is going up, but nowhere near as fast as they thought it would. The computer models just weren’t reliable. In fact,” he goes on breezily, “I’m not sure the whole thing isn’t crazy, this climate change. You’ve only got to look at Singapore. It’s two-and-a-half times higher than the worst-case scenario for climate change, and it’s one of the most desirable cities in the world to live in.” There are various possible explanations for his change of heart. One is that Lovelock is right, and the models on which his former predictions were based were fatally flawed. Another is that his iconoclastic sensibility made revision irresistible. An incorrigible subversive, Lovelock was warning the world about climate change for decades before it began to pay attention, and just when the scientific consensus began to call for intervention to prevent it, he decided we were already too late. But there is a third explanation for why he has shifted his position again, and nowadays feels “laid back about climate change”. All things being equal – “and it’s only got to take one sizable volcano to erupt and all the models, everything else, is right off the board” – he expects that before the consequences of global warming can impact on us significantly, something else will have made our world unrecognisable, and threaten the human race. Lovelock in 1991, with one of his books on Gaia theory.  Lovelock maintains that, unlike most environmentalists, he is a rigorous empiricist, but it is manifestly clear that he enjoys maddening the green movement. “Well, it’s a religion, really, you see. It’s totally unscientific.” He was once invited to Buckingham Palace, where he told Princess Anne: “Your brother nearly killed me.” Having read that Prince Charles had installed grass-burning boilers at Highgrove, Lovelock had tried one in his house. “It’s supposed to smoulder and keep the place warm; but it doesn’t, because it goes out, and clouds and clouds of smoke come out.” He giggles. “Princess Anne thought this was hilariously funny.” Lovelock had been trying to heat his old mill in Devon, where he lived for more than 35 years, inventing contraptions in a workshop that resembled a Doctor Who set. He and his wife recently packed up his life’s work and downsized to a remote cottage on Chesil Beach in Dorset, after the bill to heat the mill for just six months hit £6,000. “I remember George Monbiot took me up on it and wrote that it was impossible, that I had to be lying. But I wasn’t lying, I’ve got the figures.” Monbiot doesn’t quite accuse him of lying, in fairness; just of “talking rubbish” and “making wild statements”. In any case, he says that in the US he found he could heat a house for six months, in temperatures of -20C (-4F), for just £60. As a result, he has withering contempt for environmentalists’ opposition to fracking. “You see, gas in America is incredibly cheap, because of fracking,” he says. But what about the risk of triggering earthquakes? He rolls his eyes. “Sure enough, that’s true, there will be an increase. But they’re tiny little tremors, they would be imperceptible. The only trouble is that you can detect them. The curse of my life has been that I’ve spent a lot of time inventing devices that are exceedingly sensitive. And the moment somebody can detect something, they’re going to attach a number to it, and then they make a fuss about it.” He chuckles, then pauses. “I’m not anti-green in the sense that I’m in favour of polluting the world with every damn thing we make. I think we’ve got to be careful. But I’m afraid, human nature being what it is, the thing gets exaggerated out of all proportion, and the greens have behaved deplorably instead of being reasonably sensible.” Even more heretical than his enthusiasm for fracking is Lovelock’s passionate support for nuclear power. But, like fracking, he says, it offers only “a stopgap” solution. “Because in the long term, they’ll use up all the uranium.” How long would that take? He pauses to do some quick mental arithmetic, as casually as I might tot up how many pints of milk to grab from Sainsburys. “Let’s see … I think uranium that is affordable to extract would last about 50 years, something in that range. It might be 100. When you’ve used all that up, you go to thorium, and that would last you three times as long as uranium – so, shall we say, about 200 years?” The most sensible energy solution would be to cover 100 sq miles of the Sahara in solar panels. “It would supply the whole of Europe with all the energy they needed,” but it won’t happen “because it would be so easy for terrorists to go and bugger it up”. So for now, nuclear energy is the only viable option. But all this, he clarifies cheerfully, is more or less academic. “Because quite soon – before we’ve reached the end of this century, even – I think that what people call robots will have taken over.” Robots will rule the world? “Well, yes. They’ll be in charge.” In charge of us? “Yes, if we’re still here. Whether they’ll have taken over peacefully or otherwise, I have no idea.” For robots, time happens a million times faster than it does for us. That’s rather wonderful in a way, isn’t it?
He isn’t alone in this view: the influential philosopher Nick Bostrom has persuaded many people that artificial intelligence poses a real threat to the future of humanity; Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, among others, have called for urgent research to mitigate the risks. Still, when Lovelock outlines this vision, his tone is so matter-of-fact that for a moment I wonder if he’s joking. He isn’t. “We’re already happily letting computers design themselves. This has been going on for some time now, particularly with chips, and it’s not going to be long before that’s out of our hands, and we’ll be standing aside and saying, ‘Oh well, it’s doing a good job designing itself, let’s encourage it.’” Computers will develop independent volition and intuition (“To some extent, they already have”) and become capable of reproducing themselves, and of evolving. “Oh yes, that’s crucial. We’ll have a world where Darwin’s working.” Darwinism doesn’t work now? “Oh no, we’ve temporarily turned Darwinism backwards. I mean, we preserve the ones that would not have survived.” Lovelock at the University of Houston in Texas in 1962 He pauses, and adds quickly: “Don’t let’s get dangerous on this one. I don’t want this appearing in the Guardian that he just wants all the dumb and the lowlifes wiped out.”
Lovelock doesn’t sound the least bit troubled by the prospect of robots taking over, though, despite the possibility that they will destroy us. “Once they become at all established anywhere, that’s the end, because to robots time happens one million times faster – that’s a fairly exact figure – than it does to us. That’s rather wonderful in a way, isn’t it?” I ask him to explain. “Well, for a neuron to travel a foot takes a microsecond – which is fairly fast. But for electrons to go down a foot of wire takes a nanosecond. It’s a million times faster, as simple as that. So to a robot, once fully established in that new world, a second is a million seconds. Everything is happening so fast that they have on earth a million times longer to live, to grow up, to evolve, than we do.” It is possible, he goes on, that human beings may fuse with robots to become a blend of robotic and human tissue (“That’s one route”), but the likelier scenario will be pure robots. Why does he think we’ll go for all-out robots? He shoots me an amused look. “I don’t think we will. I think that they will – that’s the key thing here.” The implications for climate change are obvious. “The world that they’re going to be comfortable in is wildly different from the one that we feel comfortable in. So once they really get established, they will – with regret – start losing organic life.” Will they care about rising temperatures? “They won’t give a fourpenny fuck about the temperature, because to them the change will be slow, and they can stand quite a big change without any fuss. They could accommodate infinitely greater change through climate change than we can, before things get tricky for them. It’s what the world can stand that is the important thing. They’re going to have a safe platform to live in, so they don’t want Gaia messed about too much.”
Notwithstanding his caveats about the dangers of predictions, his confidence in the robotic future he describes is “fairly high. Yes, all sorts of things can happen, but that’s the intuitive feeling I have”. As for our interaction with robots: “Well, it’s going to be very peculiar.” In the classic Frankenstein tradition, will humanity not understand what it has created until it’s too late? “Well, too late is the wrong word. Let’s say, until it has happened.” The phrase “too late”, he explains, implies regret – but whereas the robots might see no use for our continued existence, “maybe we’ve got some special property that they will appreciate. But then, don’t forget, their timescale is a million times different from ours. They’d have a lot of trouble talking to us.” In the same sense that we have trouble talking to ants? “Oh no, it’s much worse than that. It’s really more like us talking to a giant redwood tree. And you never know, they may feel about us the same way as we feel about trees.” They might even, I suggest, want to hug us? Lovelock’s face lights up in delight. “Yes, exactly! Exactly. That’s a good one.” Lovelock was no less bafflingly cheerful when he believed climate change was about to wipe out 80% of the world’s population. How can he now feel just as sanguine about a global takeover by robots? “One may say: ‘Well, of course, he’s so old he’s stopped having any feelings.’ Not true, I’ll say!” He would have been, he insists, just the same 50 years ago. “And I would hate to think it was an affectation.” He would rather not be called a maverick, because it makes him sound like someone who “makes gadgets in his garage”. “But everything in life to me is just: ‘Oh, isn’t that interesting?’”"	James Lovelock: ‘Before the end of this century, robots will have taken over’	partially false
03a10122	"CORRECTION: This article has been updated to indicate that other fire suppression policies, which allow forests to accumulate kindling, predated then-President Bill Clinton’s rules. It has also been updated to include arguments that climate change is increasing the severity of wildfires in the West. Additionally, a previous version of this article stated that an average of 10 million feet of timber was removed each year from Forest Service land between 1960 and 1990. The actual number was 10.3 billion. The article has been updated to reflect the change. This post has also been updated to clarify that wildfire fuels such as underbrush increased after Clinton’s Northwest Forest Plan, though logging can, in some instances, increase the risk of forest fires. A citation to a study noting that the plan was inconsistent with managing fire-frequent forests was also added to this post. Former President Bill Clinton’s land management rules and other liberal policies paved the way for future debilitating wildfires, fire expert Bob Zybach told the Daily Caller News Foundation. Zybach warned of potential disastrous wildfires shortly after Clinton signed a slate of rules in the mid-1990s that, according to a study published in the Ecological Society of America in 2019, was “inconsistent with management for … historically fire-frequent forests.” Zybach’s comments come as California, Oregon, and parts of Washington deal with catastrophic wildfires that have killed 26 people and destroyed buildings.
Former President Bill Clinton made a significant change to federal land management nearly 30 years ago that created conditions necessary to increase the severity of wildfires on the West Coast, according to one fire expert who predicted the problem years ago.
Shortly before leaving office in 2001, Clinton limited the ability of the United States Forest Service to thin out a dense thicket of foliage and downed trees on federal land to bring the West into a pristine state, Bob Zybach, an experienced forester with a PhD in environmental science, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. The former president’s decision created a ticking time bomb, Zybach argues.
“If you don’t start managing these forests, then they are going to start burning up. Thirty years later, they are still ignoring it,” said Zybach, who spent more than 20 years as a reforestation contractor. He was referring to warnings he made years ago, telling officials that warding off prescribed burns in Oregon and California creates kindling fueling fires. Such rules make it more difficult to deploy prescribed burns, which are controlled burns designed to cull all of the underbrush in forests to lessen the chance of massive fires, Zybach noted. Years of keeping these areas in their natural state result in dead trees and dried organic material settling on the forest floor, turning such material into matchsticks soaked in jet fuel during dry seasons, he said.
Zybach’s comments come as wildfires continue churning through parts of California, Oregon and Washington, media reports show. Fires have killed 26 people in West Coast states since August, including 19 people in California, and have culminated in more than half-a-million people evacuating Oregon, a number representing roughly 10% of the state’s overall population.
Roughly 100 massive fires are blazing Saturday in the West, including 12 in Idaho and nine in Montana, the National Interagency Fire Center said Saturday. All told, the wildfires have churned through more than 4.5 million acres in 12 states. (RELATED: Wildfires, Blackouts And High Gas Prices: Californians Fight Familiar Foes Amid Pandemic) Shortly before leaving office, Clinton introduced the Roadless Rule that restricted the use of existing roads and construction of new roads on 49 million acres of National Forest, making it difficult for officials to scan the land for the kind of kindling that fuels massive conflagrations.
The move was part of the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP), a resolution adopted by Clinton in 1994 in order to settle ongoing disputes between economic and environmental interests, according to The New York Times. The plan was intended to protect certain portions of forests while allowing logging in others. But the plan was “inconsistent with management for ecological integrity in the dry, historically fire‐frequent forests” that make up portions of the protected forests, according to a study published in the Ecological Study of America in 2019. Meanwhile, fire suppression policies, which began at the beginning of the 20th century, have allowed kindling to accumulate in forests, according to The Guardian.
Ten years before Clinton’s rule, the Fish and Wildlife Service placed the northern spotted owl on the Endangered Species Act, forcing the Forest Service to adopt a new policy that resulted in a greater reduction in timber harvests. The amount of timber removed from federal lands plummeted, according to data accumulated in 2015 by the Reason Foundation. An average of 10.3 billion feet of timber was removed each year from Forest Service land between 1960 and 1990, the data show. Those numbers dropped between 1991 and 2000 and continued dropping — an average of only 2.1 billion feet of timber was removed from the land between 2000 and 2013, according to the data. That’s an 80% decline.
And while logging can be an ineffective method to preventing forest fires and can, in some instances, cause an increase, according to the BBC, the Times reported that, following the Northwest Forest Plan, wildfire risk grew along with fuels like combustable trees and underbrush. Actions like “thinning and prescribed fire to reduce fuel continuity” would “promote ecological integrity” in certain portions of forests protected under the plan, according to the Ecological Society of America study.
“They’ve gone and left hundreds of thousands of acres of burnt timber, a fire bomb waiting to happen, standing in place because the black back woodpecker prefers that habitat,” Zybach said. “It’s great for lawyers, but it’s bad for people who breathe air or work in the woods.” “The prescribed burns are an ancient form of management for keeping the fuels down so these events don’t happen,” Zybach added, referring to Native American Indians who used controlled burns to ward away pests and prevent wildfires from licking their homes. The Clinton administration’s plan to turn forests in the West into pristine land free of human interference risked fueling “wildfires reminiscent of the Tillamook burn, the 1910 fires and the Yellowstone fire,” Zybach, who is based in Oregon, told Evergreen magazine in 1994, when the NWFP came into effect.
Western Oregon had one major fire above 10,000 acres between 1952 and 1987, reports show. The Silver Complex Fire of 1987 snapped that streak after torching more than 100,000 acres in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness area, killing rare plants and trees the federal government sought to protect from human activities.
And the Mendocino Complex Fire is spreading across California and is on its way to becoming the largest wildfire in the state, engulfing more than 283,000 acres.
Zybach said he believes land management, rather than climate change, is increasing the severity of Western wildfires, noting that climate change has little to do with kindling gathering on forest floors.
University of Washington climate scientist Cliff Mass told the DCNF in 2018 that “the key factors are mismanaged forests, years of fire suppression, increased population, people living where they should not, invasive flammable species, and the fact that California has always had fire.” Other scientists, however, say climate change is the driving cause as summer heat intensifies and further dries out dead brush on forest floors.
The Washington Post reported that the West is becoming hotter, drier and and more susceptible to large blazes. It also pointed to an August study that found fall days in California with extreme fire-weather conditions had more than doubled since the 1980s.
“I can’t say it was unexpected what happened there, but the speed with which it went was mind-blowing to a lot of us,” a U.S. Forest Service research ecologist, Eric Knapp, told the Post, referring to the Creek Fire. Climate change increased the likelihood and severity of a drought that killed trees ahead of the fire in that region, according to the Post.
Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama tweeted: “The fires across the West Coast are just the latest examples of the very real ways our changing climate is changing our communities.”
Similarly, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted: “The proof of the urgency of the climate crisis is literally in the air around us.” The New York Democrat included a link to a Sept. 10 article from CBS blaming climate change for the fires.
Fire Experts Agree: Prescribed Burns Are Critical, Experts Say
Overzealous fire suppression across California are helping to build up wildland fuels, which contribute to wildfires, according to Tim Ingalsbee, a fire ecologist who began a career in the 1980s as a wildland firefighter. The solution is “to get good fire on the ground and whittle down some of that fuel load,” he told ProPublica in August.
“It’s just … well … it’s horrible. Horrible to see this happening when the science is so clear and has been clear for years. I suffer from Cassandra syndrome,” Ingalsbee said, referring to a Greek metaphor people use when they believe their valid warnings are ignored.
“Every year I warn people: Disaster’s coming,” he said. “We got to change. And no one listens. And then it happens.”
Other experts have made similar arguments in the past. (RELATED: Decades Of Mismanagement Turned US Forests Into ‘Slow-Motion Time Bombs’)
A US forestry firefighter cools a burning modular home to protect a nearby structure in Deerhorn Valley as the Harris Fire continues growing beyond 70,000 acres on October 24, 2007 near Jamul, California. Southern California is being ravaged by numerous record wildfires as Santa Ana Wind conditions push them into communities surrounded by native Chaparral habitat that has been dried by the driest rain season since records began 130 years ago. The fires are shaping up to be the worst wildfire event in San Diego County history. As many as 500,000 people have been evacuated from their homes. 
Overgrown grasslands, forests, and woodlands contributed to California wildfires in 2017, Sasha Berleman, a fire ecologist, told High Country News that year.
“I’m more certain than ever that there’s a lot we can do between now and the next time this happens to make it so that the negative consequences to people are nowhere near as dramatic,” she said.
The devastating fires that ran through California’s wine country in October of 2017 killed 42 people and destroyed nearly 7,000 buildings, High Country News noted.
The solution might be easier said than done. Nearly 20 million acres in California, or an area about the size of Maine, will need to experience controlled burns to limit catastrophic wildfires, a January study from Nature Sustainability found.
"	Wildfires Will Become Worse Thanks To Decades-Old Liberal Policies, Says Fire Expert Who Predicted Uptick In Blazes	partially false
917ea895	"Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world It's the final call, say scientists, in the most extensive warning yet on the risks of rising global temperatures. Their dramatic report on keeping that rise under 1.5 degrees C says the world is now completely off track, heading instead towards 3C. Keeping to the preferred target of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will mean ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"". It will be hugely expensive - but the window of opportunity remains open.
After three years of research and a week of haggling between scientists and government officials at a meeting in South Korea, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has issued a special report on the impact of global warming of 1.5C. What could be wiped out by temperature rise What is climate change? The critical 33-page Summary for Policymakers certainly bears the hallmarks of difficult negotiations between climate researchers determined to stick to what their studies have shown and political representatives more concerned with economies and living standards. Despite the inevitable compromises, there are some key messages that come through loud and clear. ""The first is that limiting warming to 1.5C brings a lot of benefits compared with limiting it to two degrees. It really reduces the impacts of climate change in very important ways,"" said Prof Jim Skea, who co-chairs the IPCC. ""The second is the unprecedented nature of the changes that are required if we are to limit warming to 1.5C - changes to energy systems, changes to the way we manage land, changes to the way we move around with transportation."" What's the one big takeaway Graphic showing what is likely to be affected by different rises in temperature Presentational white space ""Scientists might want to write in capital letters, 'ACT NOW, IDIOTS,' but they need to say that with facts and numbers,"" said Kaisa Kosonen, of Greenpeace, who was an observer at the negotiations. ""And they have."" The researchers have used these facts and numbers to paint a picture of the world with a dangerous fever, caused by humans. We used to think if we could keep warming below two degrees this century, then the changes we would experience would be manageable. Not any more. This new study says that going past 1.5C is dicing with the planet's liveability. And the 1.5C temperature ""guard rail"" could be exceeded in just 12 years, in 2030. We can stay below it - but it will require urgent, large-scale changes from governments and individuals and we will have to invest a massive pile of cash every year, about 2.5% of global gross domestic product (GDP), the value of all goods and services produced, for two decades. Even then, we will still need machines, trees and plants to capture carbon from the air that we can then store deep underground - forever.
What can I do? No more beef? Five things you can do to help stop rising global temperatures The report says there must be rapid and significant changes in four big global systems: energy • land use • cities • industry But it adds that the world cannot meet its target without changes by individuals, urging people to: buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter and more locally sourced seasonal food - and throw less of it away • drive electric cars but walk or cycle short distances • take trains and buses instead of planes • use videoconferencing instead of business travel • use a washing line instead of a tumble dryer • insulate homes • demand low carbon in every consumer product Lifestyle changes can make a big difference, said Dr Debra Roberts, the IPCC's other co-chair. ""That's a very empowering message for the individual,"" she said. ""This is not about remote science; it is about where we live and work, and it gives us a cue on how we might be able to contribute to that massive change, because everyone is going to have to be involved.""
""You might say you don't have control over land use, but you do have control over what you eat and that determines land use. ""We can choose the way we move in cities and if we don't have access to public transport - make sure you are electing politicians who provide options around public transport."" The hottest that this location has ever been...map showing where temperature records were broken across the world this summer  Presentational grey line Five steps to 1.5 Global emissions of CO2 need to decline by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 Renewables are estimated to provide up to 85% of global electricity by 2050 Coal is expected to reduce to close to zero Up to seven million sq km of land will be needed for energy crops (a bit less than the size of Australia) Global net zero emissions by 2050 Presentational grey line How much will all this cost? It won't come cheap. The report says to limit warming to 1.5C, will involve ""annual average investment needs in the energy system of around $2.4 trillion"" between 2016 and 2035. Experts believe this number needs to be put in context. ""There are costs and benefits you have to weigh up,"" said Dr Stephen Cornelius, a former UK IPCC negotiator now with WWF. He says making big emissions cuts in the short term will cost money but be cheaper than paying for carbon dioxide removal later this century. ""The report also talks about the benefits as there is higher economic growth at 1.5 degrees than there is at 2C and you don't have the higher risk of catastrophic impacts at 1.5 that you do at two.""
Five things we have learned from the report Fast fashion is harming the planet, MPs say Vietnam's children and the fear of climate change How years compare with the 20th Century average 2019 10 warmest years10 coldest years What happens if we don't act?
The researchers say that if we fail to keep temperature rises below 1.5C, we are in for some significant and dangerous changes to our world. You can kiss coral reefs goodbye, as the report says they would be essentially 100% wiped out at two degrees of warming. Global sea-level will rise about 10cm (4in) more if we let warming go to 2C. That may not sound like much but keeping to 1.5C means that 10 million fewer people would be exposed to the risks of flooding. There are also significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat. ""We are already in the danger zone at one degree of warming,"" said Kaisa Kosonen, from Greenpeace. ""Both poles are melting at an accelerated rate; ancient trees that have been there for hundreds of years are suddenly dying; and the summer we've just experienced - basically, the whole world was on fire."" In 1980, the minimum sea ice extent was 7.7 million square kilometres. This year it was at 4.7 million square kilometres.2012 was the lowest year on record, when it was down to 3.6 million square kilometres - less than half what it was in 1980. Sea ice extent is much lower than in 1980. It reached its lowest level in 2012 Presentational grey line Is this plan at all feasible? Analysis by David Shukman, BBC science editor The countdown to the worst of global warming seems to have accelerated. Seriously damaging impacts are no longer on a distant horizon later this century but within a timeframe that appears uncomfortably close. By the same token, the report's ""pathways"" for keeping a lid on temperatures all mean that hard decisions cannot be delayed: a shift away from fossil fuels by mid-century coal phased out far sooner than previously suggested vast tracts of land given over to forests It's mind-bending stuff and some will say it's hopelessly unrealistic, a climate scientists' fantasy. So is any of it plausible? On the one hand, the global economy relies on carbon and key activities depend on it. On the other, wind turbines and solar panels have tumbled in price and more and more countries and states such as California are setting ambitious green targets. Ultimately, politicians will face a difficult choice: persuade their voters that the revolutionary change outlined in the report is urgently needed or ignore it and say the scientists have got it wrong. Is all this about saving small island states? The idea of keeping the global temperature rise to 1.5 is something very close to the hearts and minds of small island and low-lying states, which fear being inundated with flooding if temperatures go to two degrees. But over the three years that the report was in preparation, more and more scientific evidence has been published showing the benefits of staying close to 1.5C are not just for island nations in the Pacific. ""If you save a small island country, then you save the world,"" said Dr Amjad Abdulla, an IPCC author, from the Maldives. ""Because the report clearly states that no-one is going to be immune. It's about morality - it's about humanity."" How long have we got?Not long at all. But that issue is now in the hands of political leaders. The report says hard decisions can no longer be kicked down the road. If the nations of the world don't act soon, they will have to rely even more on unproven technologies to take carbon out ofthe air - an expensive and uncertain road. ""They really need to start work immediately. The report is clear that if governments just fulfil the pledges they made in the Paris agreement for 2030, it is not good enough. It will make it very difficult to consider global warming of 1.5C,"" said Prof Jim Skea. ""If they read the report and decide to increase their ambitions and act more immediately, then 1.5C stays within reach - that's the nature of the choice they face."" Campaigners and environmentalists, who have welcomed the report, say there is simply no time left for debate. ""This is the moment where we need to decide"" said Kaisa Kosonen. ""We want to move to clean energy, sustainable lifestyles. We want to protect our forests and species. This is the moment that we will remember; this is the year when the turning point happened.""
"	Final call to save the world from 'climate catastrophe'	partially false
3a90d9c8	"The dramatic melting of Arctic ice is already driving extreme weather that affects hundreds of millions of people across North America, Europe and Asia, leading climate scientists have told the Guardian.
Severe “snowmageddon” winters are now strongly linked to soaring polar temperatures, say researchers, with deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods also probably linked. The scientists now fear the Arctic meltdown has kickstarted abrupt changes in the planet’s swirling atmosphere, bringing extreme weather in heavily populated areas to the boil. The northern ice cap has been shrinking since the 1970s, with global warming driving the loss of about three-quarters of its volume so far. But the recent heat in the Arctic has shocked scientists, with temperatures 33C above average in parts of the Russian Arctic and 20C higher in some other places. In November, ice levels hit a record low, and we are now in “uncharted territory”, said Prof Jennifer Francis, an Arctic climate expert at Rutgers University in the US, who first became interested in the region when she sailed through it on a round-the-world trip in the 1980s. “These rapid changes in the Arctic are affecting weather patterns where you live right now,” she said. “In the past you have had natural variations like El Niño, but they have never happened before in combination with this very warm Arctic, so it is a whole new ball game. “It is inconceivable that this ridiculously warm Arctic would not have an impact on weather patterns in the middle latitudes further south, where so many people live. “It’s safe to say [the hot Arctic] is going to have a big impact, but it’s hard to say exactly how big right now. But we are going to have a lot of very interesting weather – we’re not going to get around that one.” The area covered by Arctic sea ice at least four years old has decreased from 718,000 sq miles in September 1984 to 42,000 sq miles in September 2016. Older ice tends to be less vulnerable to melting. The age of the ice is indicated by shades ranging from blue-gray for the youngest ice to white for the oldest. Credits: Nasa The chain of events that links the melting Arctic with weather to the south begins with rising global temperatures causing more sea ice to melt. Unlike on the Antarctic continent, melting ice here exposes dark ocean beneath, which absorbs more sunlight than ice and warms further. This feedback loop is why the Arctic is heating up much faster than the rest of the planet.
This in turn narrows the temperature difference between the Arctic and lower latitudes, which is crucial because it is the temperature gradient between them that drives the jet stream wind, which streaks around the pole at up to 250mph and about 8km above the surface. The jet stream forms a boundary between the cold north and the warmer south, but the lower temperature difference means the winds are now weaker. This means the jet stream meanders more, with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes. Furthermore, researchers say, the changes mean the loops can remain stuck over regions for weeks, rather than being blown westwards as in the past. This “blocking” effect means extreme events can unfold.
“There have been recent studies showing very plausible physical mechanisms of how rapid warming in the Arctic can influence weather in the mid latitudes, both in summer and winter,” said Dim Coumou at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Coumou is a former offshore industry geophysicist who has studied the link between extreme weather events and global warming since 2010. “A couple of years ago this was the main criticism on any such links, that the physics was not well understood,” he said. “But the big question [now] is, how important are these mechanisms?” The other main influence on the jet stream is sea surface temperature in the tropics, which waxes and wanes with El Niño, while solar cycles and even volcanic eruptions have smaller effects. The clearest connection so far between the melting Arctic and weather is for extreme winter conditions, such as the intense winters that hit parts of North America and northern Europe in 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2013-14, causing record snowfalls and billions of dollars of damage. In those years, the jet stream deviated deeply southwards over those regions, pulling down savagely cold air. Prof Adam Scaife, a climate modelling expert at the UK’s Met Office, said the evidence for a link to shrinking Arctic ice was now good: “The consensus points towards that being a real effect.” While downswings of the jet stream can bring freezing winters, the accompanying upswings have been linked to worsening the drought in California. “These northward jet stream swings are of course the reason California is having such a terrible drought,” said Francis. This effect was in fact predicted back in 2004, with those researchers now saying: “Reality is moving faster than we thought or hoped it would.”
But the winter extremes can also swing the other way and bring mild but torrential weather, as seen in the past two winters in the UK, leading to severe flooding, said Prof Edward Hanna, at the University of Sheffield in the UK.
150 years of global warming in a minute-long symphony Guardian He pointed to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a cyclic variation in air pressure that may be affected by the fast melting of Arctic ice. The variability of the NOA has doubled in the last century, he said: “Within the last decade, there have been wild swings in the NAO values in December.” The connection between the vanishing Arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere is probable, according to scientists, but not yet as certain as the winter link. Blocking patterns caused by slow-moving meanders of the jet stream have been firmly linked to some devastating events, including the 2010 summer floods in Pakistan, which killed 2,000 people and affected 20 million, and also the searing heatwave in Russia in the same year, which killed 50,000 people and wiped out $15bn (£12bn) of crops. Villagers stand outside their homes during flash floods on the outskirts of Peshawar, Pakistan, April 2016
“We also see such summer events more often in recent years,” said Coumou. Blocking events have also been linked to summer deluges in the UK, leading to disastrous flooding in 2007 and 2012 which caused billions of pounds in damage.
The year 2012 was also an extreme year for Greenland, with record melting across its entire surface flushing water into the ocean and accelerating sea level rise. The hot loop of air that sat on Greenland that year may also be linked to one of the biggest weather disasters of recent years: Hurricane Sandy, which killed 233 people and cost $75bn in damages. Scientists suspect that the blocking event over Greenland, potentially linked to the record low Arctic ice that summer, prevented the hurricane veering north-east out into the Atlantic like most storms. Instead, blocked by the high pressure, Sandy swung left over the most populated area of the east coast of the US. Damage caused by Hurricane Sandy in Rodanthe, North Carolina, October 2012
Another consequence of the fast melting Arctic raises the possibility that there may be even worse extreme weather to come, according to a few scientists: titanic Atlantic superstorms and hurricanes barreling across Europe.
The melting of Greenland ice is pouring about 250bn tonnes a year of fresh water, which is less dense than salty sea water, into the ocean. As a result, the water mass sinks less and the current that drags warm water up the Atlantic is weakened – scientists have already found that the current is at its weakest for a millennium. This means a region of the north Atlantic is becoming relatively cool and this exaggerates the contrast with tropical waters to the south, which is the driver for storms. In the worst case scenario, said the renowned climate scientist Prof James Hansen, this “will drive superstorms, stronger than any in modern times – all hell will break loose in the north Atlantic and neighbouring lands”.
Hansen– who was one of the first scientists to alert the world to the dangers of climate change in 1988 and has been arrested more than once outside the White House while protesting against fossil fuel developments – pointed to the historical record as a precedent: 118,000 years ago a superstorm tossed 1,000-tonne mega boulders on to the shores of the Bahamas.
“I would certainly not call such [superstorm] scenarios ridiculous,” said Coumou. “But it is speculative – we don’t have the hard evidence.”
But even with what is known so far, there is cause for concern that the complex interactions are turning the slow burn of global temperature rise into sudden weather disasters.
“The worrying aspect is that such dynamical changes can occur more abruptly than simple background warming of the climate,” said Coumou. “Dynamical changes can change more rapidly and can therefore lead to surprises and I think there are many such possibilities in the system.” A polar bear swims in Svalbard. The fjords there would usually be partially covered with sea ice, but last winter most of the archipelago was surrounded by open water. 
Amid the gloomy prospects, there is some cause for hope however. “A large fraction of the US public still doesn’t believe that it is humans that are affecting the climate system,” said Francis. “But one of the silver linings of this pretty dark cloud is that the Arctic is such an obvious and conspicuous change, that anybody can see them happening. There is no ambiguity whatsoever.”
But this changing of minds needs to happen quickly, said Hansen: “If we wait for the natural world to reveal itself clearly, it may be too late.”"	Arctic ice melt 'already affecting weather patterns where you live right now'	other
2d038c58	"Scientist Peter Wadhams believes the summer ice cover at the north pole is about to disappear, triggering even more rapid global warming. Scientist Peter Wadhams believes the summer ice cover at the north pole is about to disappear, triggering even more rapid global warming. Peter Wadhams has spent his career in the Arctic, making more than 50 trips there, some in submarines under the polar ice. He is credited with being one of the first scientists to show that the thick icecap that once covered the Arctic ocean was beginning to thin and shrink. He was director of the Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge from 1987 to 1992 and professor of ocean physics at Cambridge since 2001. His book, A Farewell to Ice, tells the story of his unravelling of this alarming trend and describes what the consequences for our planet will be if Arctic ice continues to disappear at its current rate. You have said on several occasions that summer Arctic sea ice would disappear by the middle of this decade. It hasn’t. Are you being alarmist?
No. There is a clear trend down to zero for summer cover. However, each year chance events can give a boost to ice cover or take some away. The overall trend is a very strong downward one, however. Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic’s summer sea-ice cover. Next year or the year after that, I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free. You will be able to cross over the north pole by ship. There will still be about a million square kilometres of ice in the Arctic in summer but it will be packed into various nooks and crannies along the Northwest Passage and along bits of the Canadian coastline. Ice-free means the central basin of the Arctic will be ice-free and I think that that is going to happen in summer 2017 or 2018. Why should we be concerned about an Arctic that is free of ice in summer? People tend to think of an ice-free Arctic in summer in terms of it merely being a symbol of global change. Things happen, they say. In fact, the impact will be profound and will effect the whole planet and its population. One key effect will be albedo feedback. Sea ice reflects about 50% of the solar radiation it receives back into space. By contrast, water reflects less than 10%. So if you replace ice with water, which is darker, much more solar heat will be absorbed by the ocean and the planet will heat up even more rapidly than it is doing at present. Sea ice also acts as an air-conditioning system. Winds coming over the sea to land masses such as Siberia and Greenland will no longer be cooled as they pass over ice and these places will be heated even further. These effects could add 50% to the impact of global warming that is produced by rising carbon emissions. In the end, the only hope we have is to find a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere once it has got there. What will be the effects of this accelerating increase in temperatures? The air over Greenland will get warmer and more and more of its ice will melt. It is already losing about 300 cubic kilometres of ice a year. Antarctica is adding to the melt as well. Sea-level rises will accelerate as a result. The most recent prediction of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is that seas will rise by 60 to 90 centimetres this century. I think a rise of one to two metres is far more likely. Indeed, it is probably the best we can hope for. That may not sound a lot but it is really very serious. It will increase enormously the frequency of storm surges all over the world. We may be able to raise the Thames barrier in Britain but in Bangladesh, it just means more and more people will be drowned. Global warming is generally associated with increased fossil-fuel burning and consequent rises in levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. But is that the only climate problem we face?
No it is not. We also have the issue of methane. Russian scientists who have investigated waters off their coast have detected more and more plumes of methane bubbling up from the seabed. The reason this is happening is closely connected with the warming of the planet and the shrinking of the Arctic icecaps. Until around 2005, even in summer, you still had sea ice near the coast. Then it started to disappear, so that for three or four months a year warm water reached the shallow waters around the shores where there had been permafrost ground since the last ice age. It has started to melt with dangerous consequences. Underneath the permafrost there are sediments full of methane hydrates. When the permafrost goes, you release the pressure on top of these hydrates and the methane comes out of solution. Can we monitor this methane just as we can monitor carbon dioxide? Yes, we can measure methane over large areas using satellites. These have shown that methane levels that had been fairly flat for most of the last century have started to rise and are accelerating, often with little outliers on the graph. There is a scientist called Jason Box who works in Denmark for the Greenland Survey and he calls these outliers dragon’s breath. They are not some sort of measurement caused by dodgy instruments. They are real pulses of methane coming from offshore flumes.

An image from the NOAA/Nasa Suomi NPP satellite taken on May 30, 2016, highlights the Arctic ice retreat off the north-west coast of Alaska. The average Arctic sea ice extent for May 2016 set a new record low since satellite observations began. Photograph: Suomi NPP/NASA/NOAA How intense is methane as a heater of the atmosphere compared with carbon dioxide? It is 23 times more powerful. However, methane dissipates much more quickly than carbon dioxide. It gets oxidised so that it only lingers in the atmosphere for about seven or eight years. By contrast, carbon dioxide hangs around in the climate system for about 100 years before it ends up in the sea and is absorbed by creatures that die and litter the seabed. At least that is what scientists thought. Today, there are quite a number of researchers who think carbon dioxide could last 1,000 years in the atmosphere. So in the long run carbon dioxide is still going to be worse than methane in terms of heating the planet because a single methane pulse will have a disastrous effect but if there is nothing to follow it on then it will go away. But with carbon dioxide there is a ratchet effect. All the carbon dioxide we release by burning fossil fuels just builds up in the atmosphere. We are having to live with last century’s carbon dioxide. What that says is simple: there is no such thing as a safe emission rate of carbon dioxide. That is why I am despondent about us ever being able to cut carbon emissions. If we cannot halt the emissions of carbon dioxide, what can we do? In the end, the only hope we have is to find a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere once it has got there. Even the IPCC has admitted that we will have to find a way to extract carbon dioxide from the air. The trouble is that they don’t just how we can do that. The most favoured scheme is known as BECCS: bio-energy with carbon capture and storage. Essentially, you plant trees and bushes over vast swaths of ground. These grow, absorbing carbon dioxide in the process. Then you burn the wood to run power plants while trapping, liquefying and storing the carbon dioxide that is released. It sounds straightforward. Will it work? I am a bit suspicious of this technology. BECCS will need so much land to be effective. Calculations suggest it would need 40% to 50% of the arable land of the planet to make it work on the scale we will need and that would not leave enough land to grow crops to feed the world or to provide homes for a viable population of wild animals and plants. Other techniques, such as crushing and spreading olivine rocks, which absorb carbon dioxide, on beaches, will simply not scale up. They won’t work, so we will have to find some other way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere directly. As far as I can see, it will have to take the form of some sort of device into which you pump air at one end and you get air without carbon dioxide coming out the other end. It can be done, I am sure, but at the moment we do not have such a device. However, without something like that I cannot see how we are going to deal with the carbon dioxide that is getting into the atmosphere. We are going to have to rely on a technology that has not yet been developed. That is a measure of the troubles that lie ahead for us. I think humanity can do it, but I would feel much better if I saw governments investing in such technology.

abc078e6	"Eight countries control land in the Arctic Circle. Five have coastlines to defend. The temperature is rising. The ice is melting. The race for newly accessible resources is beginning. And Russia is gaining ground. The story of the Arctic begins with temperature but it’s so much more—this is a tale about oil and economics, about humanity and science, about politics and borders and the emerging risk of an emboldened and growing Russian empire. Arctic glaciers, such as this one in Russia’s Novaya Zemlya archipelago, have captured the attention of scientists who are trying to understand how they melt and flow. Photo: DigitalGlobe via Getty Images The world as a whole has warmed about 0.9 degrees Celsius (1.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1880. Arctic temperatures have risen twice that amount during the same time period. The most recent year analyzed, October 2015 to September 2016, was 3.5C warmer than the early 1900s, according to the 2016 Arctic Report Card. Northern Canada, Svalbard, Norway and Russia’s Kara Sea reached an astounding 14C (25F) higher than normal last fall. Scientists refer to these dramatic physical changes as “Arctic amplification,” or positive feedback loops. It’s a little bit like compound interest. A small change snowballs, and Arctic conditions become much less Arctic, much more quickly. “After studying the Arctic and its climate for three-and-a-half decades,” Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data center, wrote recently. “I have concluded that what has happened over the last year goes beyond even the extreme.” Change in Average Annual Temperatures Source: Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia The heat is making quick work of its natural prey: ice. Scientists track the number of “freezing-degree days,” a running seasonal tally of the amount of time it’s been cold enough for water to freeze.

Photographer: Mario Tama/Getty Images Sea ice has diminished much faster than scientists and climate models anticipated. Last month set a new low for March, out-melting 2015 by 23,000 square miles. Compared with the 1981-2010 baseline, the average September sea-ice minimum has been dropping by more than 13 percent per decade. A recent study in Nature Climate Change estimated that from 30-50 percent of sea ice loss is due to climate variability, while the rest occurs because of human activity. Receding ice decreases the Earth’s overall reflectivity, making the Arctic darker and therefore absorbing even more heat.

In 1985, about 45 percent of Arctic sea ice was made up of older and thicker multi-year ice. By 2016, that number shrank to 22 percent. With a greater percentage of seasonal ice, which disappears each Arctic summer, nations of the north have more time and opportunity to explore the resources beneath and within their territorial waters. The sea-ice loss is President Vladimir Putin’s gain. Already the largest country on the planet, Russia stands to gain access to shipping routes and energy reserves, and a strategic military advantage from the opening of the Arctic. Along the Russian coastline, which makes up more than half the Arctic total, winds and currents push old ice away from potential shipping lanes and prevent the build-up of thicker, multi-year ice that would leave other parts of the Arctic impassable for longer periods. That dynamic helps bring the Northern Sea Route—shippers’ hoped-for Russian express between Western Europe and East Asia—closer to fruition.

Photographer: Paulo Costa/Getty Images Sea ice, by definition, is already in the water and therefore doesn't add to rising ocean levels as it dissolves. The same logic does not apply to Greenland’s melting glaciers and ice sheets. Last year, Greenland saw the second-largest melt on record. The hot season lasted a troubling 30 to 40 days longer than usual in the northeast portion of the region. There's enough water locked up in Greenland’s ice sheet to raise seas worldwide by 20 feet. While it may take centuries to fully melt, scientists are concerned that we have a limited time to act to prevent the climate from locking in the ice sheet’s demise.

Named for its distinctive hue, this ice is so thin that sunlight shines through, allowing phytoplankton to thrive. Vegetation growth in parts of Canadian and Russian Arctic waters has boomed to from 5 and 19 percent above the 2003-2015 average, according to NOAA. What the change means for delicate ecosystems and fish stocks is the subject of increasing research attention. In a presentation in November, Johan Rockström, environmental scientist and director of the Stockholm Resilience Center, reached for scientific euphemism to make manageable the enormous scale of these interlocking changes—and who needs to be thinking about them: “Canada, Russia and parts of the U.S. seem to be the Arctic nations subject to the largest, let’s say, set of diverse regime-shift risks."" In the long run, every part of the Arctic food web may have to adjust to the warming atmosphere’s byproduct: altered ocean chemistry. Oceans do humanity a huge favor by absorbing some atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, when CO2 dissolves into water, it becomes a weak acid that, as it accumulates, may strain ecosystems that have evolved for today’s slightly alkaline waters. The change is happening globally, but cold water “acidifies” more quickly than warmer seas. Arctic land stores about twice as much carbon as the atmosphere. While growing seasons—which are now either longer or newly possible, depending on the exact location—suck in carbon dioxide during the spring and summer, scientists believe the thawing lands are now emitting more carbon than they take in.

Warming temperatures have accelerated the rate of natural underground methane leaks. The gas builds up in the soil, forming mounds called “pingoes.” When the pressure becomes too great, the ground explodes, leaving 30 to 40-meter-wide craters. Seismologists have begun to install sensors in the Russian Arctic to give advance notice of fields ready to blow their top. These local events are a powerful visual example of how the world is changing in dramatic and surprising ways. This crater was created by the explosion of a “pingo,” a pocket of methane gas on Russia’s Yamal Peninsula, in northern Siberian. Warming ground temperatures are causing pingoes to pop with greater frequency.

03ed5214	You’ve probably heard about some of the impacts of rising seas: Nearly a fifth of Bangladesh, in South Asia, could be submerged; some low-lying islands in the Pacific may disappear; coastal cities like Miami and New York are expected to see more floods. But exactly how and why are the seas rising? The underlying answer, of course, is that humans are warming the planet by burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests and engaging in other activities that release heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. Policy makers have concluded that the warming would be especially dangerous if it crosses a threshold of 2 degrees Celsius higher than Earth’s temperature at the start of the industrial revolution. But for details on how climate change is raising the height of the ocean, I turned to CNN International meteorologist and supervising weather producer Brandon Miller. I’ll be exploring sea-level rise and what happens to people whose homes are flooded this month as part of CNN’s “2 degrees” series on climate change. Let me know in the comments at the bottom of this post if there are other sea-level-related questions you’d like to see answered. And consider signing up for the “2 degrees” newsletter if you’d like to follow along. 1. Why are sea levels rising? Global sea level rise occurs because of two factors. The biggest reason is because of something called “thermal expansion,” which is simply that water expands as it warms, just like how the liquid in a thermometer expands as the temperature increases. Therefore, as global temperatures continue to rise, the oceans get warmer and they literally expand, making the level of the sea rise. The other main contributor to sea level rise is the loss of glaciers and the polar ice caps. When the glaciers and ice caps melt, that water flows into the ocean and increases its volume. 2. Is this already happening – or is it a future thing? Yes it is already happening, and yes it will continue to happen in the future, with the rate of sea level rise likely increasing as well. Since 1900 we have seen seas rise, on average, about 20 cm (8 inches). While ocean levels varied over the past 2,000 years, they did so much more slowly. It would have taken several hundred years to change the ocean level by the amount we have witnessed over the past century, with a bulk of that increase coming in the last 25 years. The rate of change in the past 20 years is about double the rate of change over the past 100 years, indicating that the rate of sea level rise is increasing. 3. What will happen to sea levels if the climate warms 2 degrees? Sea levels will certainly continue to rise if the climate warms 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit). Sea level rise will not stop, even if the warming ends at 2 degrees. Instead, it will continue for many centuries due to the lag in response times of the world’s oceans and massive ice sheets. If we look at the distant past, 120,000 years ago, when only very early humans existed, the temperature was 2 degrees warmer than it is now. Sea levels were about 5 meters (16 feet) higher than they are today. Nearly 500 million people worldwide currently live below 5 meters elevation. 4. How much are sea levels expected to rise by, say, 2100? According to the latest projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a 2 degree increase in temperature by the end of this century would result in about a half a meter (1.5 feet) of sea level rise. If we drastically and immediately reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses we are currently emitting, the sea level will still continue to rise as the result of the warming we have already seen, but it should be less, likely around 40 cm (15 inches). If we continue increasing greenhouse gas emissions at the current rate, the increase in sea level could be up to double that amount, or 80 cm (31 inches) by 2100. 5. What about in the really, really long term? One of the big questions is how much warming will it take to melt the Greenland Ice Sheet, which contains enough water to raise sea levels by 7 meters (23 feet). This is an incredibly difficult question to answer, but current research shows it is likely between 1 degree and 4 degrees warming, compared to pre-industrial averages. If 2 degrees is enough to melt the Greenland Ice Sheet, for instance, it could mean sea levels would rise much higher and faster than current projections show. A total melting of Greenland’s ice likely would take thousands of years, though. 6. Are lots of the Pacific islands actually going to disappear? Likely not disappear, at least not in the short term (through the end of this century), but they will be dramatically impacted. Many low-lying regions will see drastic changes to their coastal geography from beach erosion, significant infrastructure challenges from things like saltwater intrusion into the water system, and population displacement from inundation. There are some extreme examples, such as the Marshall Islands, where 99% of the country lies below 5 meters in elevation, which could literally be “wiped off the map,” but the problem is far more wide-reaching than a few tiny Pacific islands. Coastal communities around the world will face higher risks for storm-induced tidal surges, frequent inundation from high tides, etc. Many of the world’s largest and most influential cities are located on the coast and must make significant preparations to combat rising sea levels. 7. What about Bangladesh? Isn’t it very high risk? Yes, absolutely. Bangladesh is in a very precarious situation in that it is vulnerable to flooding from all sides as a result of climate change. Increasing sea levels will continuously shrink the low-level coastal communities, while the major rivers that flow through Bangladesh (Ganges and Brahmaputra) will face increasing water levels from melting glaciers in the Himalayas. Bangladesh has the eighth largest population of any country – at 158 million – and a majority of these people live in the areas where these rising rivers meet a rising sea. 8. What’s happening to U.S. cities – like New York, NOLA and Miami? The World Bank recently led a study that ranked cities around the globe in terms of their risk of coastal flooding resulting from climate change. When looking at overall costs of damage, five of the top 10 cities were in the United States: Miami (2), New York (3), New Orleans (4), Tampa (7), Boston (8). This is largely due to the massive amounts of infrastructure, economic assets and population that are located directly on the coast and at low elevation. Based on the 2014 U.S. National Climate Assessment, New York City would see a local sea level rise of nearly 4 feet by 2100. A 4-foot sea level rise for New York would result in nearly 100,000 people being underwater in New York City alone, with a property value of $16.5 billion. 9. How many people will be displaced by rising seas? In a 2-degree world, hundreds of millions of people will be affected by coastal flooding as a result of climate change. Asia, namely East, Southeast, and South Asia will be particularly affected. Unfortunately, some of these regions which will face the largest and most immediate impacts from rising seas have the fewest resources to combat them. In many cases, the cost of coastal adaptation may be too much, flooding from storms pushing higher water levels into homes will become too frequent, or the intrusion of saltwater into the local water table will make growing crops impossible – and people in all regions of the world will be forced to leave their homes and cities.	Climate: 9 questions on rising seas	true
8695b2a9	“The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm.” Hurricane Harvey looms off the coast of Texas, as seen from aboard the International Space Station. Every so often, the worst-case scenario comes to pass. As of Sunday afternoon, the remnants of Hurricane Harvey seem likely to exceed the worst forecasts that preceded the storm. The entire Houston metropolitan region is flooding: Interstates are under feet of water, local authorities have asked boat owners to join rescue efforts, and most of the streams and rivers near the city are in flood stage. Some models suggest that the storm will linger over the area until Wednesday night, dumping 50 inches of water in total on Houston and the surrounding area. “Local rainfall amounts of 50 inches would exceed any previous Texas rainfall record. The breadth and intensity of this rainfall are beyond anything experienced before,” said a statement from the National Weather Service. “Catastrophic flooding is now underway and expected to continue for several days.” (In years of weather reporting, I have never seen a statement this blunt and ominous.) This means that thousands of people—and perhaps tens of thousands of people—are facing a terrifying and all-too-real struggle to survive right now. In an age when the climate is changing rapidly, a natural question to ask is: What role did human-caused global warming play in strengthening this storm? Climate scientists, who specialize in thinking about the Earth system as a whole, are often reticent to link any one weather event to global climate change. But they say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey—and the recent history of tropical cyclones worldwide—suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse. It may not be obvious why global warming has anything to do with hurricane strength. Climate change is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These gases prevent some of the sun’s rays from bouncing back into space, trapping heat in the planetary system and raising air temperatures all over the world. This warmer air causes evaporation to happen faster, which can lead to more moisture in the atmosphere. But that phenomenon alone does not explain climate change’s effects on Harvey. Storms like Harvey are helped by one of the consequences of climate change: As the air warms, some of that heat is absorbed by the ocean, which in turn raises the temperature of the sea’s upper layers. Harvey benefited from unusually toasty waters in the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm roared toward Houston last week, sea-surface waters near Texas rose to between 2.7 and 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit above average. These waters were some of the hottest spots of ocean surface in the world. The tropical storm, feeding off this unusual warmth, was able to progress from a tropical depression to a category-four hurricane in roughly 48 hours. “This is the main fuel for the storm,” says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research. “Although these storms occur naturally, the storm is apt to be more intense, maybe a bit bigger, longer-lasting, and with much heavier rainfalls [because of that ocean heat].” This also suggests an explanation for one of Harvey’s strangest and scariest behaviors. The storm intensified up until the moment of landfall, achieving category-four strength hours before it slammed into the Texas coast. This is not only rare for tropical cyclones in the western Gulf of Mexico: It may be unique. In the past 30 years of records, no storms west of Florida have intensified in the last 12 hours before landfall. Why do storms normally weaken—and why didn’t Harvey? As mentioned above, hurricanes feed and grow on warm ocean surface waters. But as they grow, their strong winds often pick up seawater, churning the oceans and moving the warmest waters deep below the surface. The same winds also bring newer, colder water closer to the atmosphere, which usually serves to drain energy and weaken the storm. That didn’t happen with Harvey. The hurricane churned up water 100 or even 200 meters below the surface, said Trenberth, but this water was still warm—meaning that the storm could keep growing and strengthening. “Harvey was not in a good position to intensify the way it did, because it was so close to land. It’s amazing it was able to do that,” he told me. All of this said, a storm like Harvey could have happened even if there was no climate change. Planning experts have long fretted over the possibility of a major hurricane striking Houston. Harvey is also a powerful hurricane forming in one of the most hurricane-friendly regions of the world at the peak of hurricane season. Storms similar to it would form in any climate. But Trenberth says that the extra heat could make the storm more costly and more powerful, overpowering and eventually breaking local drainage systems. “The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm,” he said. “It may have been a strong storm, and it may have caused a lot of problems anyway—but [human-caused climate change] amplifies the damage considerably.” More generally, it’s still unclear what effect climate change is having on hurricane formation across the greater Atlantic Ocean. A draft version of a major U.S. government review of climate science due out later this year says there is “medium confidence” that human activities “have contributed to the observed upward trend in North Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s.” Houston has been ground zero for super-damaging storms lately. It has seen four 100-year flooding events since the spring of 2015, according to the meteorologist Eric Holthaus. The city also sees 167 percent more heavy downpours than it did in the 1950s. Meanwhile, only one-sixth of its residents have federal flood insurance, though that program has struggled to adjust to the increased flooding risk associated with climate change. Yet even compared to recent storms, Harvey is unprecedented—just the kind of weird weather that scientists expect to see more of as the planet warms. Harvey has already dumped more water on Harris County than Tropical Storm Allison, the area’s previous worst-ever flooding disaster in 2001, though it has only lasted half the time of that earlier storm. And it will keep raining. As of Sunday afternoon, Buffalo Bayou, a major river near downtown Houston, is one foot above flood stage. It is projected to rise as much as another 12 feet today alone.

d4903310	"A chunk of floating ice that weighs more than a trillion metric tons broke away from the Antarctic Peninsula, producing one of the largest icebergs ever recorded and providing a glimpse of how the Antarctic ice sheet might ultimately start to fall apart. A crack more than 120 miles long had developed over several years in a floating ice shelf called Larsen C, and scientists who have been monitoring it confirmed on Wednesday that the huge iceberg had finally broken free. 100 MILES ANTARCTICA SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN How the crack grew After accelerating across the Antarctic Peninsula, the direction of the crack sharply turned 90º in May.

SOUTH PENINSULA GLACIERS ANTARCTIC PENINSULA Composite image by The New York Times from NASA Blue Marble, NOAA and NASA CIMSS imagery There is no scientific consensus over whether global warming is to blame. But the landscape of the Antarctic Peninsula has been fundamentally changed, according to Project Midas, a research team from Swansea University and Aberystwyth University in Britain that had been monitoring the rift since 2014. “The remaining shelf will be at its smallest ever known size,” said Adrian Luckman, a lead researcher for Project Midas. “This is a big change. Maps will need to be redrawn.”
Thin sea ice Ice shelf 820 FEET DEEP 900 FEET Rift seen from space Beginning of rift about 40 miles from the edge 10 MILES Larsen C, like two smaller ice shelves that collapsed before it, was holding back relatively little land ice, and it is not expected to contribute much to the rise of the sea. But in other parts of Antarctica, similar shelves are holding back enormous amounts of ice, and scientists fear that their future collapse could dump enough ice into the ocean to raise the sea level by many feet. How fast this could happen is unclear. In the late 20th century, the Antarctic Peninsula, which juts out from the main body of Antarctica and points toward South America, was one of the fastest-warming places in the world. That warming had slowed or perhaps reversed slightly in the 21st century, but scientists believe the ice is still catching up to the higher temperatures. Some climate scientists believe the warming in the region was at least in part a consequence of human-caused climate change, while others have disputed that, seeing a large role for natural variability — and noting that icebergs have been breaking away from ice shelves for many millions of years. But the two camps agree that the breakup of ice shelves in the peninsula region may be a preview of what is in store for the main part of Antarctica as the world continues heating up as a result of human activity. “While it might not be caused by global warming, it’s at least a natural laboratory to study how breakups will occur at other ice shelves to improve the theoretical basis for our projections of future sea level rise,” said Thomas P. Wagner, who leads NASA’s efforts to study the polar regions. The time-lapse image below shows the rift gradually widening from late 2014 to January of this year. In frigid regions, ice shelves form as the long rivers of ice called glaciers flow from land into the sea. The result is a bit like a clog in a drain pipe, slowing the flow of the glaciers feeding them. When an ice shelf collapses, the glaciers behind it can accelerate, as though the drain pipe had suddenly cleared. At the remaining part of Larsen C, the edge is now much closer to a line that scientists call the compressive arch, which is critical for structural support. If the front retreats past that line, the northernmost part of the shelf could collapse within months. “At that point in time, the glaciers will react,” said Eric Rignot, a climate scientist at the University of California, Irvine, who has done extensive research on polar ice. “If the ice shelf breaks apart, it will remove a buttressing force on the glaciers that flow into it. The glaciers will feel less resistance to flow, effectively removing a cork in front of them.” Scientists also fear that two crucial anchor points will be lost. According to Dr. Rignot, the stability of the whole ice shelf is threatened, as the shelf front thins. “You have these two anchors on the side of Larsen C that play a critical role in holding the ice shelf where it is,” he said. “If the shelf is getting thinner, it will be more breakable, and it will lose contact with the ice rises.” Low shelf support High If the shelf front disconnects from the ice rises, a rapid retreat will be triggered.
SHELF FRONT Bawden Ice Rise Gipps Ice Rise ICE SHELF NORTH PENINSULA GLACIERS SOUTH PENINSULA GLACIERS Ice rises are islands that are overridden by the ice shelf, allowing them to shoulder more of the weight of the shelf. Scientists have yet to determine the extent of thinning around the Bawden and Gipps ice rises, though Dr. Rignot noted that the Bawden ice rise was more vulnerable. “We’re not even sure how it’s hanging on there,” he said. “But if you take away Bawden, the whole shelf will feel it.”
The Antarctic Peninsula may be a canary in a coal mine. The collapse of the peninsula’s ice shelves can be interpreted as fulfilling a prophecy made in 1978 by a renowned geologist named John H. Mercer of Ohio State University. In a classic paper, Dr. Mercer warned that the western part of Antarctica was so vulnerable to human-induced climate warming as to pose a “threat of disaster” from rising seas. He said that humanity would know the calamity had begun when ice shelves started breaking up along the peninsula, with the breakups moving progressively southward. The Larsen A ice shelf broke up over several years starting in 1995; the Larsen B underwent a dramatic collapse in 2002; and now, scientists fear, the calving of the giant iceberg could be the first stage in the breakup of Larsen C. “As climate warming progresses farther south,” Dr. Rignot said, “it will affect larger and larger ice shelves, holding back bigger and bigger glaciers, so that their collapse will contribute more to sea-level rise.” For more Times reporting on Antarctica, read the Antarctic Dispatches or watch four virtual-reality films in The Antarctica Series."

dab821ac	A large research synthesis, published in one of the world’s most influential scientific journals, has detected a decline in the amount of dissolved oxygen in oceans around the world — a long-predicted result of climate change that could have severe consequences for marine organisms if it continues. The paper, published Wednesday in the journal Nature by oceanographer Sunke Schmidtko and two colleagues from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany, found a decline of more than 2 percent in ocean oxygen content worldwide between 1960 and 2010. The loss, however, showed up in some ocean basins more than others. The largest overall volume of oxygen was lost in the largest ocean — the Pacific — but as a percentage, the decline was sharpest in the Arctic Ocean, a region facing Earth’s most stark climate change. The loss of ocean oxygen “has been assumed from models, and there have been lots of regional analysis that have shown local decline, but it has never been shown on the global scale, and never for the deep ocean,” said Schmidtko, who conducted the research with Lothar Stramma and Martin Visbeck, also of GEOMAR. Ocean oxygen is vital to marine organisms, but also very delicate — unlike in the atmosphere, where gases mix together thoroughly, in the ocean that is far harder to accomplish, Schmidtko explained. Moreover, he added, just 1 percent of all the Earth’s available oxygen mixes into the ocean; the vast majority remains in the air. Climate change models predict the oceans will lose oxygen because of several factors. Most obvious is simply that warmer water holds less dissolved gases, including oxygen. “It’s the same reason we keep our sparkling drinks pretty cold,” Schmidtko said. But another factor is the growing stratification of ocean waters. Oxygen enters the ocean at its surface, from the atmosphere and from the photosynthetic activity of marine microorganisms. But as that upper layer warms up, the oxygen-rich waters are less likely to mix down into cooler layers of the ocean because the warm waters are less dense and do not sink as readily. “When the upper ocean warms, less water gets down deep, and so therefore, the oxygen supply to the deep ocean is shut down or significantly reduced,” Schmidtko said. The new study represents a synthesis of literally “millions” of separate ocean measurements over time, according to GEOMAR. The authors then used interpolation techniques for areas of the ocean where they lacked measurements. The resulting study attributes less than 15 percent of the total oxygen loss to sheer warmer temperatures, which create less solubility. The rest was attributed to other factors, such as a lack of mixing. Matthew Long, an oceanographer from the National Center for Atmospheric Research who has published on ocean oxygen loss, said he considers the new results “robust” and a “major advance in synthesizing observations to examine oxygen trends on a global scale.” Long was not involved in the current work, but his research had previously demonstrated that ocean oxygen loss was expected to occur and that it should soon be possible to demonstrate that in the real world through measurements, despite the complexities involved in studying the global ocean and deducing trends about it. That’s just what the new study has done. “Natural variations have obscured our ability to definitively detect this signal in observations,” Long said in an email. “In this study, however, Schmidtko et al. synthesize all available observations to show a global-scale decline in oxygen that conforms to the patterns we expect from human-driven climate warming. They do not make a definitive attribution statement, but the data are consistent with and strongly suggestive of human-driven warming as a root cause of the oxygen decline. “It is alarming to see this signal begin to emerge clearly in the observational data,” he added. “Schmidtko and colleagues’ findings should ring yet more alarm bells about the consequences of global warming,” added Denis Gilbert, a researcher with the Maurice Lamontagne Institute at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in Quebec, in an accompanying commentary on the study also published in Nature. Because oxygen in the global ocean is not evenly distributed, the 2 percent overall decline means there is a much larger decline in some areas of the ocean than others. Moreover, the ocean already contains so-called oxygen minimum zones, generally found in the middle depths. The great fear is that their expansion upward, into habitats where fish and other organism thrive, will reduce the available habitat for marine organisms. In shallower waters, meanwhile, the development of ocean “hypoxic” areas, or so-called “dead zones,” may also be influenced in part by declining oxygen content overall. On top of all of that, declining ocean oxygen can also worsen global warming in a feedback loop. In or near low oxygen areas of the oceans, microorganisms tend to produce nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas, Gilbert writes. Thus the new study “implies that production rates and efflux to the atmosphere of nitrous oxide … will probably have increased.” The new study underscores once again that some of the most profound consequences of climate change are occurring in the oceans, rather than on land. In recent years, incursions of warm ocean water have caused large die-offs of coral reefs, and in some cases, kelp forests as well. Meanwhile, warmer oceans have also begun to destabilize glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica, and as they melt, these glaciers freshen the ocean waters and potentially change the nature of their circulation. When it comes to ocean deoxygenation, as climate change continues, this trend should also increase — studies suggest a loss of up to 7 percent of the ocean’s oxygen by 2100. At the end of the current paper, the researchers are blunt about the consequences of a continuing loss of oceanic oxygen. “Far-reaching implications for marine ecosystems and fisheries can be expected,” they write	Scientists have just detected a major change to the Earth’s oceans linked to a warming climate	true
6c88493a	The United States is witnessing a massive, dangerous heat wave, as a huge system of high pressure covers the central part of the country. It’s a big enough deal that yesterday President Obama even tweeted about it, including a map showing the maximum heat index in some parts of the Midwest and Southeast reaching 110 or 115 degrees on Saturday. Here in Washington, temperatures could break 100 degrees Friday or over the weekend.   This will, inevitably, lead to much talk of climate change in the coming days. So it’s important to separate the scientific wheat from the chaff and figure out what science can, and can’t, reliably say about the link between an event like this and a warming planet — especially in a year that, on a global scale, has shattered past temperature records for six out of the last six months. And the gist is that when it comes to extreme heat waves in general — heat waves that appear out of the norm in some way, for instance in their intensity, frequency, or duration — while scientists never say individual events are “caused” by climate change, they are getting less and less circumspect about making some connection. “As predictable as the sunrise, some will say heat waves always happened,” said Marshall Shepherd, director of the atmospheric sciences program at the University of Georgia and former president of the American Meteorological Society. “Yep, so did home runs in baseball, but the steroid era brought more and longer home runs. A new National Academies study suggests that ‘heat waves’ may be one of the primary climate change markers like home runs were in baseball.” In other words, when a planet warms, the odds shift in favor of more intense or long lasting heat waves. That’s just plain logic. Indeed, the National Academy of Sciences report in question notes that, “Confidence in attribution findings of anthropogenic influence is greatest for those extreme events that are related to an aspect of temperature, such as the observed long-term warming of the region or global climate, where there is little doubt that human activities have caused an observed change.” “In particular, for extreme heat and cold events, changes in long-term mean conditions provide a basis for expecting that there should also be changes in extreme conditions.” And we’ve definitely already had changes in not only “long-term mean conditions,” but in heat waves themselves. The U.S. National Climate Assessment found that U.S. heat waves have already “become more frequent and intense,” that the U.S. is shattering high temperature records far more frequently than it is shattering low temperature records (just as you’d expect), and that it is seeing correspondingly fewer cold spells. As for future projections, meanwhile, the assessment added that “Climate models project that the same summertime temperatures that ranked among the hottest 5% in 1950-1979 will occur at least 70% of the time by 2035-2064 in the U.S. if global emissions of heat-trapping gases continue to grow.” However, pointing all of this out is not the same as making a specific attribution for this specific heat event — rather, it is saying that attribution can be made for this class or type of event. Beyond that, specific attribution requires active research, and an attention to the actual temperatures, duration and other aspects of the weather phenomenon. That’s because, as Shepherd notes, there are always heat waves, even in a stable climate. Typically, in such an attribution study, scientists will use sets of climate models — one set including the factors that drive human global warming and the other including purely “natural” factors — and see if an event like the one in question is more likely to occur in the first set of models. Researchers are getting better and better at performing these kinds of studies fast, in near real time. So don’t be at all surprised if we see such a study for the current heat wave event — just as we saw for, most recently, the devastating bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, which was tied to an extreme marine heatwave off Australia’s northeastern coast. But in the meantime, some scientists and experts aren’t holding back. With every heat wave, probably the number one question is, is it climate change, or is it not? Well the answer is, it’s both,” said Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe on a press call Thursday. “We get heat waves naturally, but climate change is amping them up, it’s giving them that extra energy, to make them even more serious, and have even greater impacts.” Hayhoe didn’t attempt a specific attribution of the current heat wave, any more than Shepherd did. Rather, she’s once again articulating the general connection. “We are not used to having heat waves that are extreme as the ones we see today,” she said. It’s important to underscore, as Hayhoe did, that this event poses severe risks to health — particularly for children and the elderly — and also to crops across the U.S. heartland. She pointed to an extreme 2003 heat wave that affected Paris and Europe, and which has indeed been connected to climate change through statistical attribution analysis. That event killed hundreds of people in Paris and London, and a recent study attributed at least some of those deaths, themselves, to climate change. So these links are real, if not always simple to characterize. Now, it’s all about watching this current event carefully, taking preparations, and seeing what scientists have to say once they run their analyses.

4b68af25	For some time, scientists fearing the mass release of greenhouse gases from the carbon-rich, frozen soils of the Arctic have had at least one morsel of good news in their forecasts: They predicted most of the gas released would be carbon dioxide, which, though a greenhouse gas, drives warming more slowly than some other gases. Scientists obviously weren’t excited about more carbon dioxide emissions, but it was better than the alternative: methane, a shorter-lived but far harder-hitting gas that could cause faster bursts of warming. Now even that silver lining is in doubt. Research released Monday suggests that methane releases could be considerably more prevalent as Arctic permafrost thaws. The research finds that in waterlogged wetland soils, where oxygen is not prevalent, tiny microorganisms will produce a considerable volume of methane, a gas that doesn’t last in the air much more than a decade but has a warming effect many times that of carbon dioxide over a period of 100 years.  What we can definitely say is that the importance of methane was underestimated until now in the carbon studies,” said Christian Knobloch, a researcher at Universität Hamburg in Germany and the lead author of the study, published in Nature Climate Change. The divergent finding came after Knoblauch and his colleagues conducted a lengthy experiment, more than seven years long, monitoring patches of submerged and artificially warmed soil from Siberia in the laboratory, and gradually seeing sensitive methane-producing microorganisms become more prevalent over time. Knoblauch contends that other studies have not examined waterlogged Arctic soils for as long, and he notes that in some cases it took three years or more for the methane-generating microorganisms to really get cranking. “What we saw is that it takes a very long time until methane starts being produced, and the study that we did is really the first one which is so long,” Knoblauch said.The research was conducted along with colleagues from several institutions in Germany, Sweden and Russia. So much methane was produced in the experiment, the researchers calculated that the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from wet soils, or wetlands, will be higher than from drier soils, where carbon dioxide should indeed be the top gas released. This finding, if further confirmed, could reorient calculations of the overall potential of permafrost to worsen global warming over the coming century. For instance, one major study of the permafrost warming potential, published in 2015 in the journal Nature, played down the potential for methane release in wet soils, saying drier soils would be the bigger problem. “In spite of the more potent greenhouse gas CH4, a unit of newly thawed permafrost carbon could have a greater impact on climate over a century if it thaws and decomposes within a drier, aerobic soil as compared to an equivalent amount of carbon within a waterlogged soil or sediment,” that research found. The new study would appear to contradict this. But Knoblauch cautions that more research would have to be done to go from these results to a forecast for just how much methane could waft from permafrost in the coming decades. It will be important to know, for instance, how much thawed permafrost will be stuck in watery conditions vs. dry ones. One Arctic permafrost expert not involved in the research, Merritt Turetsky of the University of Guelph, praised the new study, noting that the researchers had spent a long time trying to uncover the behavior of tiny methane-producing organisms in watery soil. The research, she said, could help bridge the gap between field studies of waterlogged permafrost that have detected methane emissions and laboratory studies that have seemed to play down the importance of the gas. “What’s remarkable about this study is the length of time they spent tracking the communities, and I think that offers a potential reason for why field and lab studies have disagreed with each other,” Turetsky said. She said the total amount of permafrost carbon that could be vulnerable because of global warming during this century — perhaps 10 percent of it, which would be more than enough to undermine global climate goals — probably won’t change in light of the new research. But the fraction of that carbon that is emitted as methane, as opposed to carbon dioxide, will be crucial, she said, and remains to be determined. “We absolutely have to partition that total permafrost carbon release into those two forms, because it really matters,” Turetsky said. “So I think that has got to be where the community goes next.” But Róisín Commane, a research associate at Harvard who studies the Arctic atmosphere and also was not involved in this research, was more skeptical about relying on this study to assume a worse verdict about methane. The study was “very nicely done,” she said, but the tendency of wet soils to produce methane could be counteracted by several factors. The soils could also become host to organisms that devour that methane — and turn it into carbon dioxide. And, as the Arctic continues to warm, soils might not retain as much water, as the subsurface ice that held it in place gradually gives way, she noted. “How much of it makes it into the atmosphere is the big thing,” Commane said. “Ecosystems will probably produce more methane as they stay wet. The big question we have is, how much of that makes it into the atmosphere, and I don’t think they get to that question here.”	The arctics carbon bomb might be even more potent than we thought	true
34855333	Ever since 2012, scientists have been debating a complex and frankly explosive idea about how a warming planet will alter our weather — one that, if it’s correct, would have profound implications across the Northern Hemisphere and especially in its middle latitudes, where hundreds of millions of people live. The idea is that climate change doesn’t merely increase the overall likelihood of heat waves, say, or the volume of rainfall — it also changes the flow of weather itself. By altering massive planet-scale air patterns like the jet stream (pictured above), which flows in waves from west to east in the Northern Hemisphere, a warming planet causes our weather to become more stuck in place. This means that a given weather pattern, whatever it may be, may persist for longer, thus driving extreme droughts, heat waves, downpours and more. This basic idea has sparked half a decade of criticism and debate, and at the cutting edge of research, scientists continue to grapple with it. And now, a new study once again reinforces one of its core aspects. ublishing in Nature Scientific Reports, Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University and a group of colleagues at research institutes in the United States, Germany and the Netherlands find that at least in the spring and summer, the large scale flow of the atmosphere is indeed changing in such a way as to cause weather to get stuck more often.  The study, its authors write, “adds to the weight of evidence for a human influence on the occurrence of devastating events such as the 2003 European heat wave, the 2010 Pakistan flood and Russian heat wave, the 2011 Texas heat wave and recent floods in Europe.” But what does it mean for global warming to alter the jet stream? The basic ideas at play here get complicated fast. The study itself, for instance, refers to “quasi-resonant amplification (QRA) of synoptic-scale waves” as the key mechanism for how researchers believe this is happening — terminology sure to impart terror in nonscientists worldwide.  On the other hand, some of this isn’t all that complicated. The Northern Hemisphere jet stream flows in a wavy pattern from west to east, driven by the rotation of the Earth and the difference in temperature between the equator and the North Pole. The flow is stronger when that temperature difference is large. But when the Arctic warms up faster than the equator does — which is part of the fundamental definition of global warming, and which is already happening — the jet stream’s flow can become weakened and elongated. That’s when you can get the resultant weather extremes. “It’s sort of like if you confine an electromagnetic wave to a coaxial cable, then you’re not losing energy, it’s being tightly contained in that cable and sent to your television,” said Mann. “These waves aren’t losing energy, so they grow and get larger and get stuck in place as well.” What the new study is saying is that in summer, in particular, this can occur. Moreover, it finds that a particular temperature pattern is linked to that behavior — and this temperature pattern, featuring an extra warm Arctic, is becoming more frequent over time, based on both observations and also a review of the outputs of high powered climate change models that the researchers conducted.  “We think that the signal has emerged from the noise over the last decade,” said Mann. One researcher who co-wrote an influential 2012 study suggesting that changes in the Arctic could be driving mid-latitude weather extremes, Stephen Vavrus of the University of Wisconsin, praised the new research in an emailed comment Monday. “This study goes beyond statistical correlations and explores a specific process that can plausibly explain how enhanced high-latitude warming trends may trigger remote weather impacts,” he said. But other scientific authors have expressed considerable skepticism of these kinds of ideas in the past. A recent study in Nature GeosciOne author of that study, John Fyfe of the Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and Analysis at Environment and Climate Change Canada, remarked of the Mann paper by email: “It is well established that there has been a human influence on the large-scale atmospheric circulation and temperature of the Northern Hemisphere. Mann et al. advance a theory that attempts to link those changes to changes in the spectrum of shorter-scale waves in the atmosphere, which are our weathermakers. I do not believe that this theory is fully developed or that the implications have been fully explored, but I do think that Mann et al.  study is a very good start.” The current study really only covers weather extremes in the spring and summer. For extremes occurring in winter, Mann said, we need to look to other mechanisms for odd atmospheric behavior. Nonetheless, the work represents yet another suggestion that a changing climate is leading to a changing pattern of atmospheric flow, with major implications for the weather felt by a massive swath of the global population. Mann, who testifies before Congress this week in a session that is expected to feature a rip-roaring debate about the severity of climate change, commented, “That’s going to be a fake debate. But this stuff is where the real debate is now.”ence, for instance, called into question whether the Arctic’s melting, and in particular its sea ice loss, has been causing winter cooling over Eurasia, another idea that has been swept up in the debate over the jet stream and weather extremes.

093939cc	Residents are leaving the Marshall Islands, but not because of climate change. Hype and exaggeration serve no one. Rangiroa atoll, lagoon and coral reefs from the air. Once a year or so, journalists from major news outlets travel to the Marshall Islands, a remote chain of volcanic islands and coral atolls in the Pacific Ocean, to report in panicked tones that the island nation is vanishing because of climate change. Their dispatches are often filled with raw emotion and suggest that residents are fleeing atolls swiftly sinking into the sea. Yet new research shows that this is not the entire—or even an accurate—picture. Acknowledging this doesn’t mean that global warming isn’t real, or that world leaders and scientists shouldn’t tackle the adverse effects of climate change, but hype and exaggeration serve no one. Using historic aerial photographs and high-resolution satellite imagery, Auckland University scientists Murray Ford and Paul Kench recently analyzed shoreline changes on six atolls and two mid-ocean reef islands in the Marshall Islands. Their peer-reviewed study, published in the September 2015 issue of Anthropocene, revealed that since the middle of the 20th century the total land area of the islands has actually grown. How is that possible? It seems self-evident that rising sea levels will reduce land area. However, there is a process of accretion, where coral broken up by the waves washes up on these low-lying islands as sand, counteracting the reduction in land mass. Research shows that this process is overpowering the erosion from sea-level rise, leading to net land-area gain. This is not only true for the Marshall Islands. The researchers write that within the “recently emerging body of shoreline change studies on atoll islands there is little evidence of widespread reef island erosion. To the contrary, several studies have documented noteworthy shoreline progradation [growth] and positional changes of islands since the mid-20th century, resulting in a net increase in island area.” The most famous of these studies, published in 2010 by Paul Kench and Arthur Webb of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission in Fiji, showed that of 27 Pacific islands, 14% lost area. Yet 43% gained area, with the rest remaining stable. Representatives from the Marshall Islands have been vocal about the need for strong global action on climate. President Hilda Heine has told reporters that longtime residents are leaving the Marshall Islands because climate change is threatening the nation’s existence. It’s true that approximately one-third of the population has relocated to the U.S.—but for reasons more mundane than climate change. Some 52.7% of the Marshall Islands population lives below the poverty line, according to the Asian Development Bank. Only 39.3% of the population age 15 years and above is employed. In its 2015 human-rights report on the island nation, the U.S. State Department said that significant problems include “chronic government corruption, and chronic domestic violence,” along with “child abuse, sex trafficking, and lack of legal provisions protecting worker’s rights.” Marshallese citizens also have an easy immigration pathway to America and can live, work and study in the U.S. without a visa. It is understandable why Marshall Island leaders might prefer to talk about global warming. But blaming today’s emigration on rising seas does a disservice to all. Telling viewers in the U.S. starkly that they’re “making this island disappear,” as a report from CNN’s John Sutter did in June 2015, makes for good, blame-laden television. But this reductionist, fact-averse rhetoric contributes to the idea that climate-change discussion should be a two-sided, cartoonish fight between those who say it is not real and those who say it is the worst problem facing humanity. Even more insidiously, doom-mongering makes us panic and seize upon the wrong responses to global warming. At a cost of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion annually, the Paris climate agreement, recently ratified by China, is likely to be history’s most expensive treaty. It will slow the world’s economic growth to force a shift to inefficient green energy sources. This will achieve almost nothing. My peer-reviewed research, published last November in the journal Global Policy, shows that even if every nation were to fulfill all their carbon-cutting promises by 2030 and stick to them all the way through the century—at a cost of more than $100 trillion in lost GDP—global temperature rise would be reduced by a tiny 0.3°F (0.17°C). In a rush to do something—and be seen to be taking drastic action—more sensible approaches to counter global warming have been overlooked. Instead of simply mandating less carbon output, we need more R&D spending on green energy, including more efficient fission and fusion, cheaper solar and wind, and improved storage. New technology is crucial if green energy is to out-compete fossil fuels. Policy makers who want to help the residents of the Marshall Islands today should look at improving the islands’ resilience and ability to cope with severe weather by improving infrastructure and storm preparedness. Tackling issues like poverty, health care, corruption and domestic violence would do even more. Those who seek to help should keep the bigger picture in mind.

f29c8cca	"Temperatures, sea levels and carbon dioxide all hit milestones amid extreme weather in 2015, major international ‘state of the climate’ report finds. A scientist leaps over water during a trip to the Greenland ice sheet, which saw melting over more than 50% of its surface last year. The world is careening towards an environment never experienced before by humans, with the temperature of the air and oceans breaking records, sea levels reaching historic highs and carbon dioxide surpassing a key milestone, a major international report has found. The “state of the climate” report, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) with input from hundreds of scientists from 62 countries, confirmed there was a “toppling of several symbolic mileposts” in heat, sea level rise and extreme weather in 2015. The climate crisis is already here – but no one’s telling us George Monbiot “The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle,” Michael Mann, a leading climatologist at Penn State, told the Guardian. “They are playing out before us, in real time. The 2015 numbers drive that home.” graph showing global temperatures Last year was the warmest on record, with the annual surface temperature beating the previous mark set in 2014 by 0.1C. This means that the world is now 1C warmer than it was in pre-industrial times, largely due to a huge escalation in the production of greenhouse gases. The UN has already said that 2016 is highly likely to break the annual record again, after 14 straight months of extreme heat aided by a hefty El Niño climatic event, a weather event that typically raises temperatures around the world. The oceans, which absorb more than 90% of the extra CO2 pumped into the atmosphere, also reached a new record temperature, with sharp spikes in the El Niño-dominated eastern Pacific, which was 2C warmer than the long-term average, and the Arctic, where the temperature in August hit a dizzying 8C above average. Graph showing ocean warming The thermal expansion of the oceans, compounded by melting glaciers, resulted in the highest global sea level on record in 2015. The oceans are around 70mm higher than the 1993 average, which is when comprehensive satellite measurements of sea levels began. The seas are rising at an average rate of 3.3mm a year, with the western Pacific and Indian Oceans experiencing the fastest increases. These changes are being driven by a CO2 concentration that surpassed the symbolic 400 parts per million mark at the Mauna Loa research station in Hawaii last year. The Noaa report states that the global CO2 level was a touch under this, at 399.4ppm, an increase of 2.2ppm compared to 2014. graph shows carbon dioxide levels Noaa said other “remarkable” changes in 2015 include the Arctic’s lowest maximum sea ice extent in the 37-year satellite record, recorded in February 2015. The world’s alpine glaciers recorded a net annual loss of ice for the 36th consecutive year and the Greenland ice sheet, which would balloon sea levels by around 7m should it disintegrate, experienced melting over more than 50% of its surface.
The rapid changes in the climate may have profound consequences for humans and other species. In June last year, a severe heatwave claimed over 1,000 lives in Karachi, Pakistan. Severe drought caused food shortages for millions of people in Ethiopia, with a lack of rainfall resulting in “intense and widespread” forest fires in Indonesia that belched out a vast quantity of greenhouse gas. Diminishing sea ice is causing major walrus herds to haul themselves out on to land. Arctic marine species, such as snailfish and polar cod, are being pushed out of the region by species coming from further south, attracted to the warming waters. A huge algal bloom off the west coast of North America harmed marine life and fisheries. graph shows sea level Scientists have said there were underlying climate change trends at play but last year was also influenced by the strong El Niño event, which is when equatorial Pacific waters warm, leading to an array of weather effects around the world. El Niño has also helped spur searing heat in 2016 but has now petered out. Thomas Karl, director of Noaa national centers for environmental information, said that last year’s climate “was shaped both by long-term change and an El Niño event. When we think about being climate resilient, both of these time scales are important to consider. “Last year’s El Niño was a clear reminder of how short-term events can amplify the relative influence and impacts stemming from longer-term warming trends.”Kate Willett, a senior scientist at Britain’s Met Office, said that there was a 75% annual increase in the amount of land that experienced severe drought last year. “Looking at a range of climate measurements, 2015 was yet another highly significant year,” she said. “Not only was 2015 the warmest year on record by a large margin, it was also another year when the levels of dominant greenhouse gases reached new peaks.” The state of the climate report is now in its 26th year. The peer-reviewed series is published annually by the American Meteorological Society."	Environmental records shattered as climate change 'plays out before us'	true
bda1ddd2	Bill Shorten and his allies, the Greens economic vandals, believe climate change is a moral issue. So is telling the truth. With his elite private school education, the Oppo­s­i­tion Leader would have learned about the Roman Warming, the Dark Ages, the Medieval Warming and the Little Ice Age. These took place before industrialisation and were all driven by changes in the sun. He would have learned that ­natural warm times, like now, bring great prosperity, increased longevity and less disease, whereas Jack Frost brings death, depopulation and economic stresses. In biology, the Labor leader would have learned of Darwinism and environmental adapta­tion of species. Humans live on ice and in the hills, valleys, tropics and des­erts, at altitude and on coastal plains. Like countless other organ­isms, we move and adapt when the environment changes. Species thrive when it is warm. READ NEXT QANDA WRAP Should Olympic athletes be vaccinated first? JOSEPH LAM From his education at a relig­ious school, he would have learned about the apostle Thomas. One of the strengths of our Western civilisation is doubt and scepticism. Surely Shorten does not believe the catastrophism promoted by green activists and self-interested alleged experts at the expense of the nation. If he does, he is unelectable. If he is knowingly promoting a falsehood, he is unelectable. Critical thinking was fundamental to our culture and should be embraced in policy formulation. In school science, Shorten would have learned carbon dioxide is the food of life and without this natural gas, which occurs in space and all planets, there would be no life. He also would understand from his maths lessons that when 3 per cent of total annual global emissions of carbon dioxide are from humans and Australia prod­uces 1.3 per cent of this 3 per cent, then no amount of emissions reductio­n here will have any effect on global climate. A quick search would show him that whenever in the past there was an explosion of plant life, the carbon dioxide content was far higher than at present. If we halve the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere, all life dies. Shorten should know that for thousands of millions of years the Earth has been changing, with cycles­ and one-off events such as an asteroid impact, super-volcano or a supernova explosion. He should know that climate always changes and that the planet would be in serious trouble if it did not. There are cycles of air, water, rocks and continents. There are measurable cycles with the sun, Earth’s orbit, oceans and moon that drive climate change, especially if cycles coincide. It has yet to be demonstrated that the climate change today is any different from those of the past. Despite hundreds of billions of dollars of expenditure during the past few decades, it still has not been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive ­global warming. Yet wind and solar industrial complexes pepper the landscape allegedly to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. They run on subsidies, not the wind or the sun. Wind and solar are transfering money from the poor to the rich, not saving the environment. These subsidies, paid by the long-suffering consumer and employer, add to emissions because coal-fired elec­tricity needs to be on standby for when there is no wind or sunshine. The amount of energy used to construct solar and wind facilities is greater than they produce in their working lives. The amount of carbon dioxide released during construction and maintenance is far more than is saved. Renew­ables such as wind turbines are environmentally disastrous because they pollute a huge land area, slice and dice birds and bats, kill insects that are bird food, create health problems for humans who live within kilometres of them, leave toxins around the turbine site and despoil the landscape. Union superannuation funds have invested massively in renewable energy. Labor’s promise of 50 per cent renewables will cost electricity consumers hundreds of billions but will benefit the unions. As soon as renewables were introduced into the grid, electric­ity prices increased and delivery became unreliable. Increased elec­tric­ity costs have created unemployment, and many pensioners and the poor cannot afford electricity. An increase in renewables will make matters worse. Does Shorten’s energy policy consider those who lose jobs and have the power cut off in his race to achieve 50 per cent renewables to fill the pockets of Labor union mates? And what about the scams siphoning off tens of billions that slosh around the world as carbon credits, carbon trading and renewable energy certificates? Rather than take this money from the poor via higher electricity prices, it would be better spent at home. To smugly claim that valid questions about energy costs are dumb or deceitful is a loud warning bell. Shorten refuses to tell us how he will spend our money or to give any detail on energy ­systems that are proven failures. It is our money and, if he will not give us the financial details, we should be very scared of his shiftiness. I have never written a blank cheque for a used car. Why should I now?

80c3c5b8	"Climate Change: Scientists just discovered a massive, heretofore unknown, source of nitrogen. Why does this matter? Because it could dramatically change those dire global warming forecasts that everybody claims are based on ""settled science."" The researchers, whose findings were published in the prestigious journal Science, say they've determined that the idea that the only source of nitrogen for plant life came from the air is wrong. There are vast storehouses in the planet's bedrock that plants also feed on.
This is potentially huge news, since what it means is that there is a vastly larger supply of nitrogen than previously believed. University of California at Davis environmental scientist and co-author of the study, Ben Houlton, says that ""This runs counter the centuries-long paradigm that has laid the foundation for the environmental sciences."" Pay close attention to the word ""paradigm."" If Houlton's finding about these vast, previously unknown nitrogen stores holds true, then it would have an enormous impact on global warming predictions. Climate scientists have long known that plants offset some of the effects of climate change by absorbing and storing CO2. But climate scientists assumed that the ability to plants to perform this function was limited because the availability of nitrogen in the atmosphere was limited. As a 2003 study published in the same Science journal put it, ""there will not be enough nitrogen available to sustain the high carbon uptake scenarios.""
In the wake of the latest findings, Ronald Amundson, a soil biogeochemist at the University of California at Berkeley, told Chemical and Engineering News that ""If there is more nitrogen there than expected, then the constraints on plant growth in a high-CO2 world may not be as great as we think."" In other words, with more nitrogen available, plant life might be able to absorb more CO2 than climate scientists have been estimating, which means the planet won't warm as much, despite mankind's pumping CO2 into the atmosphere. A Stunning Finding Houlton has been exploring this possibility for years. Back in 2011, he reported that forest trees can tap into nitrogen found in rock.
At the time, he said ""the stunning finding that forests can also feed on nitrogen in rocks has the potential to change all projections related to climate change,"" because it meant there could be more carbon storage on land and less in the atmosphere than climate models say. The question is whether any climate scientists or environmentalists — who are entirely wedded to the idea that industrialization is destroying the planet — would ever admit this.
That's why that word ""paradigm"" is important. As we've noted in this space, the idea of ""settled science"" peddled by environmentalists and politicians defies the history of science, which has seen repeated upheavals of previous forms of ""settled science.""
Thomas Kuhn studied this phenomenon in his 1962 book ""The Structure Of Scientific Revolutions."" He explained how scientists develop a theory — or paradigm — based on available evidence — to explain what they're seeing.
Once that paradigm takes hold, scientists are often loath to give up on it even if evidence piles up that it might be wrong. Eventually, however, faulty paradigms do give way, ushering in a new scientific paradigm. Examples of such paradigm shifts in the past: heliocentric solar system, continental drift, Einstein's theories. A Coming Paradigm Shift? That same thing might be happening right now with climate science.
As we've said many times, evidence continues to show weaknesses in climate models used to predict future warming. They failed to predict a decade-long pause in global temperatures. Nor have various calamities that were supposed to have occurred by now materialized. And a recent paper published in Nature concluded that the planet is less sensitive to increases in CO2 than the computer models say.
Meanwhile, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been conducting highly suspicious temperature data manipulation. The changes in the temperature data consistently make the past seem cooler, which in turn makes the present seem warmer.
This creates a data illusion of ever-rising temperatures to match the increase in CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere. Marc Morano, editor of the popular ClimateDepot blog and author of ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change,"" notes that ""science is not supposed to have a politically predetermined outcome pushed by ideology and politics. This new nitrogen study is but one example of consensus science being overturned.  The global warming science establishment should now be open to similar studies and dissenting voices on CO2 to overturn the alleged climate change consensus."" But will they? With their reputations and huge amounts government grant money at stake, it's unlikely that many climate scientists would ever admit to being wrong. No matter how obvious it became that they were."

0fc59c8b	Earth is a planet in upheaval, say scientists, as the World Meteorological Organisation publishes analysis of recent heat highs and ice lows. A boat lies in the dry Cedro reservoir in Quixadá, Brazil. Climate change increases the risk of extreme weather events like drought. The record-breaking heat that made 2016 the hottest year ever recorded has continued into 2017, pushing the world into “truly uncharted territory”, according to the World Meteorological Organisation. The WMO’s assessment of the climate in 2016, published on Tuesday, reports unprecedented heat across the globe, exceptionally low ice at both poles and surging sea-level rise. Global warming is largely being driven by emissions from human activities, but a strong El Niño – a natural climate cycle – added to the heat in 2016. The El Niño is now waning, but the extremes continue to be seen, with temperature records tumbling in the US in February and polar heatwaves pushing ice cover to new lows. “Even without a strong El Niño in 2017, we are seeing other remarkable changes across the planet that are challenging the limits of our understanding of the climate system. We are now in truly uncharted territory,” said David Carlson, director of the WMO’s world climate research programme. “Earth is a planet in upheaval due to human-caused changes in the atmosphere,” said Jeffrey Kargel, a glaciologist at the University of Arizona in the US. “In general, drastically changing conditions do not help civilisation, which thrives on stability.” The WMO report was “startling”, said Prof David Reay, an emissions expert at the University of Edinburgh: “The need for concerted action on climate change has never been so stark nor the stakes so high.” The new WMO assessment also prompted some scientists to criticise Donald Trump. “While the data show an ever increasing impact of human activities on the climate system, the Trump administration and senior Republicans in Congress continue to bury their heads in the sand,” said Prof Sir Robert Watson, a distinguished climate scientist at the UK’s University of East Anglia and a former head of the UN’s climate science panel. “Our children and grandchildren will look back on the climate deniers and ask how they could have sacrificed the planet for the sake of cheap fossil fuel energy, when the cost of inaction exceeds the cost of a transition to a low-carbon economy,” Watson said. Trump is aiming to cut climate change research. But the WMO’s secretary-general Petteri Taalas said: “Continued investment in climate research and observations is vital if our scientific knowledge is to keep pace with the rapid rate of climate change.” 2016 saw the hottest global average among thermometer measurements stretching back to 1880. But scientific research indicates the world was last this warm about 115,000 years ago and that the planet has not experienced such high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for 4m years. 2017 has seen temperature records continue to tumble, in the US where February was exceptionally warm, and in Australia, where prolonged and extreme heat struck many states. The consequences have been particularly stark at the poles. “Arctic ice conditions have been tracking at record low conditions since October, persisting for six consecutive months, something not seen before in the [four-decade] satellite data record,” said Prof Julienne Stroeve, at University College London in the UK. “Over in the southern hemisphere, the sea ice also broke new record lows in the seasonal maximum and minimum extents, leading to the least amount of global sea ice ever recorded.” Eel grass grows in sediment at Lowell’s Cove, Maine, US. The rise of sea level has ruined this once rocky location. Emily Shuckburgh, at the British Antarctic Survey, said: “The Arctic may be remote, but changes that occur there directly affect us. The melting of the Greenland ice sheet is already contributing significantly to sea level rise, and new research is highlighting that the melting of Arctic sea ice can alter weather conditions across Europe, Asia and North America.” Global sea level rise surged between November 2014 and February 2016, with the El Niño event helping the oceans rise by 15mm. That jump would have take five years under the steady rise seen in recent decades, as ice caps melt and oceans get warmer and expand in volume. Final data for 2016 sea level rise have yet to be published. Climate change harms people most directly by increasing the risk of extreme weather events and the WMO report states that these raised risks can increasingly be calculated. For example, the Arctic heatwaves are made tens of times more likely and the soaring temperatures seen in Australia in February were made twice as likely. “With levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere consistently breaking new records, the influence of human activities on the climate system has become more and more evident,” said Taalas.

c9a710dc	Hillary Clinton's plane passes over Manhattan October 11, 2016 as she departs New York en route to a climate change event with former Vice President Al Gore in Miami, Florida. Hillary Clinton and Al Gore spoke at Miami-Dade College on October 11 about the “climate crisis” that Gore has been trying to convince us about for 20 years. Just as in Gore’s movie An Inconvenient Truth, weather disasters that have always occurred have been repurposed to support the climate change narrative, with the claim those disasters are getting worse. Meanwhile, Chapman University has released a survey of the top ten issues Americans fear the most. Guess what? Climate change didn’t make the list. Instead, corruption of politicians was the No. 1 worry. For those who don’t see the relationship between these two newsworthy events, let me connect the dots for you. Global warming and climate change, even if it is 100% caused by humans, is so slow that it cannot be observed by anyone in their lifetime. Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and other natural disasters have yet to show any obvious long-term change. This means that in order for politicians to advance policy goals (such as forcing expensive solar energy on the masses or creating a carbon tax), they have to turn normal weather disasters into “evidence” of climate change. As a climate researcher, I will agree that humans have likely contributed to a portion of recent warmth. I am not a denier of either natural or human-induced climate change. But the observed warming as monitored by satellites (our only truly global monitoring system) has been only about half of what computerized climate models say should be happening. Furthermore, the overall increases in such things as hurricanes and tornadoes have not materialized. Drought in the western U.S. pales in comparison to the mega-droughts tree rings tell us existed in centuries past. Lake-bottom sediments in Florida tell us that recent major hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico has been less frequent than in centuries past. Strong Sandy-type storms occur every year in all the major ocean basins… they just don’t happen to hit major metropolitan areas. It has now, even after Hurricane Matthew, been over 4,000 days since a major hurricane (Category 3 or stronger) has made landfall in the U.S. Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated and still amounts to only 1 inch every ten years. If a major hurricane is approaching with a predicted storm surge of 10-14 feet, are you really going to worry about a sea level rise of 1 inch per decade? If Hillary would have fact-checked her example of sea level rise in Norfolk, Virginia, she would have found out that the experts already know this is mostly due to the land there sinking. To the extent that the cost of weather disasters has risen over time, that is well known to be the result of modern society building more infrastructure in areas that are prone to damage from weather—which is almost everywhere. So, to keep the masses alarmed, politicians must claim that what is normal is actually abnormal—and getting worse. And, furthermore, that only they can fix it … and thereby save your children and grandchildren. And it is that “fix” that really sinks any current plan politicians have to address climate change. Even the modern godfather of global warming, ex-NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies director James Hansen, has admitted that the Paris climate agreement is “a fraud really, a fake.” This is because even if the countries of the world agree to do what they promised on climate change, and that climate change is entirely our fault, and that climate change really will ultimately get bad, the promised actions will have no measurable effect on future global temperatures. You see, many of those countries that have signed on to the Paris Agreement aren’t signing up to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. They are signing up for wealth transfers from the minority of advanced countries to the majority of poor countries. And you can’t even fix the problem with a new agreement. Why? Because until we develop a practical, cost-competitive alternative to fossil fuels, it is unlikely that renewable energy will ever make up more than 15-20% of global energy requirements. The amount of energy necessary for humans to do everything we do is simply too large. As that demand for energy grows, the amount of renewable energy also has to grow, just to maintain only a 15-20% fraction of the total. So, until people actually experience climate change, and new energy technologies are developed, any claims by politicians that we are in a “climate crisis” will fall on deaf ears. And since the biggest risk to humanity is poverty, if we allow policymakers to have their way, the resulting energy poverty will indeed cause the deaths of some of our children and grandchildren.

e6907337	New Delhi, Feb 20 (IANS) After a Disinfo Lab report highlighted that the toolkit dropped accidentally by Greta Thunberg had a foreign expert – Pieter Friedrich – as resource point waging a propaganda war against India in collusion with Pakistan’s notorious spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), investigation by a Greek media outlet has revealed that Turkey is an “integral part” of this campaign, aiding Pakistan to spread unrest in India. The Disinfo Lab investigation titled ‘The Unending War: From Proxy War to Info-War’ released earlier this week has exposed the elaborate design which involved a slew of shady companies in the United States, fake foreign experts and even ghost entities to dent India’s peaceful, non-violent image. It mentioned in detail about the linkages of the mastermind waging an info-war/psy-war against India to major terror plot hatched against India in the 1990s in collusion with ISI and how, while taking the cover of Khalistan, the network “still around and connected” works for Pakistani interests. Following the leads from the Disinfo Lab report, an investigation done by a leading Greek news website has decoded the Ankara connection to the entire propaganda being peddled against India, especially during the ongoing farmers protest. “One of the most prominent names revealed in the report and has been promoting Pieter Friedrich’s propaganda as an ‘amplifier’, is Constantinople (Istanbul) based propagandist Ali Keskin. Sources suggest that he is the central figure responsible for coordination between the Pakistani ISI and the Turkish intelligence agency (MIT) on information warfare,” reported Greek City Times. The report said that Turkey has been an integral part of this warfare and has been aiding Pakistan in its disinformation campaign against India. Scanning Keskin’s Twitter handle, the Greek publication said that the war-mongering tweets made by him against India, Greece, France, UAE and Israel were mostly spread by Pakistani handles. “Several investigations by news organisations have revealed that disgruntled with the emerging India-UAE ties, Ali Keskin, with the help of his amplifiers in Pakistan, began a hashtag #BoycottUAE, which became a top trending hashtag within a couple of minutes. This was thanks to the magnification by radical Pakistanis,” the report said. Keskin, the investigation further revealed, has, along with another Turkish journalist Baba Umar “who is believed to be working for the ISI” been assigned to hit countries targeted by Turkey, especially India. The duo has been regularly coordinating with the Pakistani propagandists and promoting each-other’s content. Fredrich too has been producing online content with Umar, attacking India by taking a pro-Pakistani line on Kashmir. “What else does one need as a proof of Khalistani’s aligning with ISI sponsored proxies? The connection between Baba Umar and Pieter Friedrich suggests that Pakistan has started to act as a converging point to bring together all anti-India forces, and Turkey is the new entrant in this group,” an expert on Caucasian affairs told the Greek media outlet. The Disinfo Lab report had highlighted Islamabad’s K-2 (Kashmir-Khalistan) plan and the elaborate design and planning that is underway since 2007 driven by singular motive – to target India’s interest in four major ways: – Targeting idea of India – non-violence & Mahatma Gandhi – replacing it with an alternate image of ‘fascist India’ – Targeting India’s territorial integrity – working towards K-2 design – Targeting India’s interests abroad by working against Indian origin American politicians – Whitewashing Pakistan’s sins – clean chit to Pakistan (ISI) in Kabul Gurudwara Bombings & questioning Pulwama attack The report by Greek City Times also listed several other propagandists like California-based Zahra Billoo – a strong supporter of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Caliphate project – working as foot soldiers in the information war launched by Turkey-Pakistan. Billoo, the report said, has tried to malign US politician Tulsi Gabbard’s image in the past, and is currently busy “amplifying the anti-India messages on farmers’ protest in India”. Her tweets are liked by Friedrich, thus clearly establishing the anti-India nexus. It is however not for the first time that the Turkey-Pakistan connection to spread terror in India, especially Kashmir, has been exposed. Kurdish news agency ANF had reported a few months ago that Turkey has started preparing its gangs in Syria to send them to Kashmir to fight for Pakistan against India. It was reported that Ankara’s bid to extend its influence to Muslims in South Asia comes as part of Erdogan’s ongoing steps to challenge Saudi Arabia’s dominance of the Islamic world.

053cbb15	Greenland's huge annual ice loss is even worse than thought. Aerial surveys show two glaciers flowing into Johan Petersen fjord in south-eastern Greenland. The melting of the ice sheet would cause oceans to rise by six metres around the world if it was lost entirely. The huge annual losses of ice from the Greenland cap are even worse than thought, according to new research which also shows that the melt is not a short-term blip but a long-term trend. The melting Greenland ice sheet is already a major contributor to rising sea level and if it was eventually lost entirely, the oceans would rise by six metres around the world, flooding many of the world’s largest cities. The new study reveals a more accurate estimate of the ice loss by taking better account of the gradual rise of the entire Greenland landmass. When the ice cap was at its peak 20,000 years ago, its great weight depressed the hot, viscous rocks in the underlying mantle. As ice has been shed since, the island has slowly rebounded upwards. Previous satellite estimates of modern ice losses tried to take this into account, but precise new GPS data showed much of Greenland is rising far more rapidly than thought, up to 12mm a year. This means 19 cubic kilometres more ice is falling into the sea each year, an increase of about 8% on earlier figures. The southern tip of Greenland seen from space. The faster rebound is thought to be the result of hotter, more elastic mantle rocks under eastern Greenland, a remnant from 40m years ago when the island passed over the hot spot that now powers Iceland’s volcanoes. The new work was also able to reconstruct the ice loss from Greenland over millennia and found that the same parts of Greenland - the north-west and south-east - were where most ice is being lost both in the past and today. This means the rapid ice loss recorded by satellite measurements over the last 20 years is not likely to be a blip, but part of a long-term trend being exacerbated by climate change. Global warming is driving major melting on the surface of Greenland’s glaciers and is speeding up their travel into the sea. “The fact that we are seeing such a similarity of past and present behaviour suggests we could lose ice in these regions for decades into the future,” said Prof Jonathan Bamber, at the University of Bristol, UK, and one of the international team of scientists who carried out the new study, published in Science Advances. Bamber said the presence of a long-term trend does not mean global warming is not a crucial factor: “One thing we can be certain of is that a warmer atmosphere and a warmer ocean is only going to accelerate this trend.” “The headlines of climate change and melting polar ice are not going to change,” said Dr Christopher Harig, at the University of Arizona, who was not involved in the study. “The new research happening now really speaks to the question: ‘How fast or how much ice can or will melt by the end of the century?’ As we understand more the complexity of the ice sheets, these estimates have tended to go up. In my mind, the time for urgency about climate change [action] really arrived years ago, and it’s past time our policy reflected that urgency.” Dr Pippa Whitehouse, at the University of Durham and also not involved in the new research, said: “This study highlights the powerful insight that GPS measurements can give into past and present ice loss. Using such measurements, this study demonstrates that some of the highest rates of ice loss across Greenland - both in the past and at present - are found in areas where the ice sheet flows directly into the ocean, making it dangerously susceptible to future warming in both the atmosphere and the ocean.” Melt water on the surface of Greenland ice sheet 10 June, 2014 and 15 June, 2016. Every spring or early summer, the surface of the sheet transforms from a vast white landscape of snow and ice to one dotted with blue meltwater streams, rivers, and lakes. In 2016, the transition started early and fast. The team behind the new research said better estimates of continental rebound rates could be even more significant in estimates of ice loss from the world’s biggest ice cap, in Antarctica, but that sparse data from the remote continent made analysis difficult. In April, very high temperatures led to a record-breaking early onset of glacier melting in Greenland, while another satellite study in August reaffirmed the rapid loss of ice.

16751630	"Cold water corals should be more resilient All sea life will be affected because carbon dioxide emissions from modern society are making the oceans more acidic, a major new report will say. The eight-year study from more than 250 scientists finds that infant sea creatures will be especially harmed. This means the number of baby cod growing to adulthood could fall to a quarter or even a 12th of today's numbers, the researchers suggest. The assessment comes from the BIOACID project, which is led from Germany. A brochure summarising the main outcomes will be presented to climate negotiators at their annual meeting, which this year is taking place in Bonn in November. The Biological Impacts of Ocean Acidification report authors say some creatures may benefit directly from the chemical changes - but even these could still be adversely affected indirectly by shifts in the whole food web. What is more, the research shows that changes through acidification will be made worse by climate change, pollution, coastal development, over-fishing and agricultural fertilisers. Ocean acidification is happening because as CO2 from fossil fuels dissolves in seawater, it produces carbonic acid and this lowers the pH of the water. Test tubes Mesocosms (""giant test tubes"") allow scientists to study acidification effects on real-world organisms. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the average pH of global ocean surface waters have fallen from pH 8.2 to 8.1. This represents an increase in acidity of about 26%. The study's lead author is Prof Ulf Riebesell from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel. He is a world authority on the topic and has typically communicated cautiously about the effects of acidification. He told BBC News: ""Acidification affects marine life across all groups, although to different degrees. ""Warm-water corals are generally more sensitive than cold-water corals. Clams and snails are more sensitive than crustaceans. ""And we found that early life stages are generally more affected than adult organisms. ""But even if an organism isn't directly harmed by acidification it may be affected indirectly through changes in its habitat or changes in the food web. ""At the end of the day, these changes will affect the many services the ocean provides to us."" On the agenda Since 2009, scientists working under the BIOACID programme have studied how marine creatures are affected by acidification during different life stages; how these reactions reverberate through the marine food web; and whether the challenges can be mitigated by evolutionary adaptation. Some research was done in the lab but other studies were conducted in the North Sea, the Baltic, the Arctic, and Papua New Guinea. A synthesis of more than 350 publications on the effects of ocean acidification - which will be given to climate delegates at next month's summit - reveals that almost half of the marine animal species tested reacted negatively to already moderate increases in seawater CO2 concentrations. Early life stages were affected in Atlantic cod, blue mussels, starfish, sea urchins and sea butterflies. But an experiment with barnacles showed they were not sensitive to acidification. And some plants - like algae which use carbon for photosynthesis - may even benefit. Marine diatoms Organisms that use calcium carbonate to build their bodies will likely struggle Dr Carol Turley, an ocean acidification expert from Plymouth Marine Labs in the UK described the BIOACID research as enormously important. She told BBC News: ""It's contributed enormous insights into the impacts that acidification can have on a wide range of marine organisms from microbes to fish. ""It's also explored how in combination with ocean warming and other stressors it might play out at the ecosystem level and affect human society. ""On the lead-up to the UN climate change negotiations in Bonn this November it is clear that the ocean and its ecosystems should not be ignored."" The conference is being held in Germany but it is being chaired by Fiji, which wants delegates to give due prominence to the effects of CO2 on the ocean."

ee916575	"Barack Obama hikes with National Park Service staffers to the Exit Glacier at Kenai Fjords National Park in Seward, Alaska. President Obama hiked to Exit Glacier in Alaska last week, with photographers in tow, to send the world a message: The glacier is melting.
Obama blames it on the increasing use of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, which he wants to restrict not only in the United States but worldwide. The photo op was designed to build support for an international climate agreement he’s pushing hard to sell, so far with little success. Trouble is, the president needs to get his facts straight. Exit Glacier has been shrinking for 200 years — since 1815 — long before widespread industrialization and automobiles. As the president ended his trip, he sounded the alarm again: “This state’s climate is changing before our eyes.” News flash, Mr. President: Alaska has been buffeted by cyclical swings in climate for thousands of years. That’s true for the rest of the world, too. There was a 300-year-long Medieval heat wave, followed by a Little Ice Age that began around 1300, and then the 300-year warming period we’re in now. The Anchorage Daily Times ran a front-page story in 1922 recording the “unheard-of temperatures” in the Arctic and glaciers disappearing. “The Arctic Ocean is warming up and icebergs are growing scarcer.” Oblivious to the history of constant climate change, Obama pointed to Exit Glacier and said: “We want to make sure our grandkids can see this.” He may get his wish, but it won’t be because of anything he’s doing. The current warming trend appears to be over, speculates Roger Cohen, a fellow of the American Physical Society. The Alaska Climate Research Center reports almost no evidence of warming trends in Alaska since 1977. Many scientists are predicting the onset of two or three centuries of cooler weather — which would mean bigger glaciers. That’s despite the world’s growing use of fossil fuels. No matter what humans do, temperature trends go up, and then down; glaciers expand and then recede; sea levels rise and then fall, explains Will Happer, professor emeritus of physics at Princeton. That doesn’t mean pollution controls are futile. We all want to breathe clean air. But don’t blame climate change on humans. There are bigger forces at work here. Scientists disagree about what these forces are, and are researching better ways of accurately measuring temperature trends via satellite. Amid all this controversy and uncertainty about global climate change, Obama blindly insists that his theory of global warming “is beyond dispute” and attacks his critics as “deniers.” Sounding more like an Old Testament doomsayer than a president, Obama warned in his Alaska speech that unless carbon fuels are restricted, “we will condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair: Submerged countries. Abandoned cities. Fields no longer growing.” Sounds scary, but he’s on thin ice backing up those predictions. Despite Obama’s professed concern for the people of Alaska affected by climate change, his visit was more about theatrics than helping locals. Alaska’s Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski lambasted Obama’s job-killing new restrictions on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic. Obama says the region’s “very fragile,” but Murkowski is more worried that the economy is fragile. “It’s clear this administration does not care about us and sees us as nothing but a territory,” she said.

It’s a demonstration of Obama’s appalling lack of priorities. The president told his Alaska audience that “few things will disrupt our lives as profoundly as climate change.” Really, Mr. President? How about the epidemic of cop shootings in the United States, or the drowned toddlers washing up on Mediterranean shores as families flee the Middle East, or ISIS beheading thousands of Christians?

Obama says that with climate change, more than any other issue, “there is such a thing as being too late.” Tell that to a cop’s widow or the father who watched his family drown."	Wake up, Obama, climate change has been happening forever	partially false
d0b0e459	"Scientists have long known about the anomalous ""warming hole"" in the North Atlantic Ocean, an area immune to warming of Earth's oceans. This cool zone in the North Atlantic Ocean appears to be associated with a slowdown in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), one of the key drivers in global ocean circulation. A recent study published in Nature outlines research by a team of Yale University and University of Southhampton scientists. The team found evidence that Arctic ice loss is potentially negatively impacting the planet's largest ocean circulation system. While scientists do have some analogs as to how this may impact the world, we will be largely in uncharted territory. AMOC is one of the largest current systems in the Atlantic Ocean and the world. Generally speaking, it transports warm and salty water northward from the tropics to South and East of Greenland. This warm water cools to ambient water temperature then sinks as it is saltier and thus denser than the relatively more fresh surrounding water. The dense mass of water sinks to the base of the North Atlantic Ocean and is pushed south along the abyss of the Atlantic Ocean. Schematic of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation This process whereby water is transported into the Northern Atlantic Ocean acts to distribute ocean water globally. What's more important, and the basis for concern of many scientists is this mechanism is one of the most efficient ways Earth transports heat from the tropics to the northern latitudes. The warm water transported from the tropics to the North Atlantic releases heat to the atmosphere, playing a key role in warming of western Europe. You likely have heard of one of the more popular components of the AMOC, the Gulf Stream which brings warm tropical water to the western coasts of Europe. Evidence is growing that the comparatively cold zone within the Northern Atlantic could be due to a slowdown of this global ocean water circulation. Hence, a slowdown in the planet's ability to transfer heat from the tropics to the northern latitudes. The cold zone could be due to melting of ice in the Arctic and Greenland. This would cause a cold fresh water cap over the North Atlantic, inhibiting sinking of salty tropical waters. This would in effect slow down the global circulation and hinder the transport of warm tropical waters north. Measured trend in temperature variations from 1900 to 2012. Melting of the Arctic sea ice has rapidly increased in the recent decades. Satellite image records indicate that September Arctic sea ice is 30% less today than it was in 1979. This trend of increased sea ice melting during summer months does not appear to be slowing. Hence, indications are that we will see a continued weakening of the global ocean circulation system. This scenario of a collapse in AMOC and global ocean circulation is the premise for the movie ""The Day After Tomorrow."" As a disclaimer, the plot line in which much of New England and Western Europe gets plunged into an ice age is significantly over exaggerated and unrealistic on human time scales. While geologists have studied events in the past similar to what appears to be happening today, scientists are largely unsure of what lies ahead."	Global Ocean Circulation Appears To Be Collapsing Due To A Warming Planet	true
af8069e0	"(CNN)Greenland's ice sheet has melted to a point of no return, and efforts to slow global warming will not stop it from disintegrating. That's according to a new study by researchers at Ohio State University. ""The ice sheet is now in this new dynamic state, where even if we went back to a climate that was more like what we had 20 or 30 years ago, we would still be pretty quickly losing mass,"" Ian Howat, co-author of the study and a professor at Ohio State University, said. Greenland's ice sheet dumps more than 280 billion metric tons of melting ice into the ocean each year, making it the greatest single contributor to global sea level rise, according to Michalea King, the lead author of the study and researcher at Ohio State University. The ice loss has been so massive in recent years, she said, that it has caused a measurable change in the gravitational field over Greenland. ILULISSAT, GREENLAND - In this aerial view melting ice forms a lake on free-floating ice jammed into the Ilulissat Icefjord during unseasonably warm weather on July 30, 2019 near Ilulissat, Greenland. Ice melting in Greenland contributes more than a millimeter rise to sea level every year, and that's likely to get worse. Sea levels are projected to rise by more than 3 feet by the end of the century, wiping away beaches and coastal properties. Coastal states like Florida, and low-lying island nations are particularly vulnerable. Just 3 feet of sea level rise could put large areas of coastline underwater. Forty percent of the US population resides in coastal areas that are vulnerable to sea level rise. ""There's a lot of places, like in Florida especially, where one meter alone would cover a lot of existing land areas,"" King said. ""And that's exacerbated when you get storms and hurricanes and things like that, that then cause extra surge on top of a higher baseline."" The study also found that the ice sheet is retreating in rapid bursts, leading to a sudden and unpredictable rise in sea levels, making it difficult to prepare for the effects. The study used four decades of satellite data to measure changes in Greenland's ice sheet. The authors found that after 2000, the ice sheet shrank so rapidly that replenishing snowfall would not keep up with the rate of melting from parts of the glacier newly exposed to warmer ocean water, even if climate change were reversed. Entire coasts of ice are retreating at once due to climate change, Howat said, adding that all 200 glaciers that make up the Greenland ice sheet have been observed retreating within the same episode. Even though the retreat of the Greenland Ice sheet likely cannot be reversed, it's just the first in a series of tipping points. If climate change continues at this rate, the rate of melting will get much worse. ""We've passed the point of no return but there's obviously more to come,"" Howat said. ""Rather than being a single tipping point in which we've gone from a happy ice sheet to a rapidly collapsing ice sheet, it's more of a staircase where we've fallen off the first step but there's many more steps to go down into the pit."""

c360c876	Exaggerated, worst-case claims result in bad policy and they ignore a wealth of encouraging data. It is an indisputable fact that carbon emissions are rising—and faster than most scientists predicted. But many climate-change alarmists seem to claim that all climate change is worse than expected. This ignores that much of the data are actually encouraging. The latest study from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that in the previous 15 years temperatures had risen 0.09 degrees Fahrenheit. The average of all models expected 0.8 degrees. So we’re seeing about 90% less temperature rise than expected. Facts like this are important because a one-sided focus on worst-case stories is a poor foundation for sound policies. Yes, Arctic sea ice is melting faster than the models expected. But models also predicted that Antarctic sea ice would decrease, yet it is increasing. Yes, sea levels are rising, but the rise is not accelerating—if anything, two recent papers, one by Chinese scientists published in the January 2014 issue of Global and Planetary Change, and the other by U.S. scientists published in the May 2013 issue of Coastal Engineering, have shown a small decline in the rate of sea-level increase. We are often being told that we’re seeing more and more droughts, but a study published last March in the journal Nature actually shows a decrease in the world’s surface that has been afflicted by droughts since 1982. Hurricanes are likewise used as an example of the “ever worse” trope. If we look at the U.S., where we have the best statistics, damage costs from hurricanes are increasing—but only because there are more people, with more-expensive property, living near coastlines. If we adjust for population and wealth, hurricane damage during the period 1900-2013 decreased slightly. At the U.N. climate conference in Lima, Peru, in December, attendees were told that their countries should cut carbon emissions to avoid future damage from storms like typhoon Hagupit, which hit the Philippines during the conference, killing at least 21 people and forcing more than a million into shelters. Yet the trend for landfalling typhoons around the Philippines has actually declined since 1950, according to a study published in 2012 by the American Meteorological Society’s Journal of Climate. Again, we’re told that things are worse than ever, but the facts don’t support this.	"
The Alarming Thing About Climate Alarmism"	partially false
13aaf021	"A blizzard! The hottest year ever! More signs that global warming and its extreme effects are beyond debate, right? Not even close. An East Coast blizzard howling, global temperatures peaking, the desert Southwest flooding, drought-stricken California drying up—surely there’s a common thread tying together this “extreme” weather. There is. But it has little to do with what recent headlines have been saying about the hottest year ever. It is called business as usual. Surface temperatures are indeed increasing slightly: They’ve been going up, in fits and starts, for more than 150 years, or since a miserably cold and pestilential period known as the Little Ice Age. Before carbon dioxide from economic activity could have warmed us up, temperatures rose three-quarters of a degree Fahrenheit between 1910 and World War II. They then cooled down a bit, only to warm again from the mid-1970s to the late ’90s, about the same amount as earlier in the century. Whether temperatures have warmed much since then depends on what you look at. Until last June, most scientists acknowledged that warming reached a peak in the late 1990s, and since then had plateaued in a “hiatus.” There are about 60 different explanations for this in the refereed literature. That changed last summer, when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) decided to overhaul its data, throwing out satellite-sensed sea-surface temperatures since the late 1970s and instead relying on, among other sources, readings taken from the cooling-water-intake tubes of oceangoing vessels. The scientific literature is replete with articles about the large measurement errors that accrue in this data owing to the fact that a ship’s infrastructure conducts heat, absorbs a tremendous amount of the sun’s energy, and vessels’ intake tubes are at different ocean depths. See, for instance, John J. Kennedy’s “A review of uncertainty in in situ measurements and data sets of sea surface temperature,” published Jan. 24, 2014, by the journal Reviews of Geophysics. NOAA’s alteration of its measurement standard and other changes produced a result that could have been predicted: a marginally significant warming trend in the data over the past several years, erasing the temperature plateau that vexed climate alarmists have found difficult to explain. Yet the increase remains far below what had been expected.

3d1a155a	There is nothing we can do about it, except to build dikes and sea walls a little bit higher. Ice crevasses near the coast of West Antarctica. Of all known and imagined consequences of climate change, many people fear sea-level rise most. But efforts to determine what causes seas to rise are marred by poor data and disagreements about methodology. The noted oceanographer Walter Munk referred to sea-level rise as an “enigma”; it has also been called a riddle and a puzzle. It is generally thought that sea-level rise accelerates mainly by thermal expansion of sea water, the so-called steric component. But by studying a very short time interval, it is possible to sidestep most of the complications, like “isostatic adjustment” of the shoreline (as continents rise after the overlying ice has melted) and “subsidence” of the shoreline (as ground water and minerals are extracted). I chose to assess the sea-level trend from 1915-45, when a genuine, independently confirmed warming of approximately 0.5 degree Celsius occurred. I note particularly that sea-level rise is not affected by the warming; it continues at the same rate, 1.8 millimeters a year, according to a 1990 review by Andrew S. Trupin and John Wahr. I therefore conclude—contrary to the general wisdom—that the temperature of sea water has no direct effect on sea-level rise. That means neither does the atmospheric content of carbon dioxide. This conclusion is worth highlighting: It shows that sea-level rise does not depend on the use of fossil fuels. The evidence should allay fear that the release of additional CO2 will increase sea-level rise. But there is also good data showing sea levels are in fact rising at a constant rate. The trend has been measured by a network of tidal gauges, many of which have been collecting data for over a century.	The Sea Is Rising, but Not Because of Climate Change	partially false
6c425155	Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide has helped raise global food production and reduce poverty. National polls show that climate change is low on the list of voters’ priorities. For good reason: In the U.S., and for much of the world, the most dangerous environmental pollutants have been cleaned up. U.S. emissions of particulates, metals and varied gases—all of these: ozone, lead, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and sulfur—fell almost 70% between 1970 and 2014. Further reductions will come from improved technologies such as catalytic removal of oxides of nitrogen and more-efficient sulfur scrubbers. This is a boon to human health. But a myth persists that is both unscientific and immoral to perpetuate: that the beneficial gas carbon dioxide ranks among hazardous pollutants. It does not. Unlike genuine pollutants, carbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless, colorless gas. Every human being exhales about two pounds of CO2 a day, along with a similar amount of water vapor. CO2 is nontoxic to people and animals and is a vital nutrient to plants. It is also a greenhouse gas which helps maintain earth at a habitable temperature. Fear of excessive warming from more CO2 in the atmosphere, including that released from human activity, has caused some people to advocate substantial and expensive reductions in CO2 emissions. But observations, such as those on our CO2 Coalition website, show that increased CO2 levels over the next century will cause modest and beneficial warming—perhaps as much as one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit)—and that this will be an even larger benefit to agriculture than it is now. The costs of emissions regulations, which will be paid by everyone, will be punishingly high and will provide no benefits to most people anywhere in the world.	"The Phony War Against CO2

8060b507	Even if world temperatures rise, the appropriate policy response is still an open question. A dike and a windmill in Rotterdam, a city already prone to floods. Climate change is often misunderstood as a package deal: If global warming is “real,” both sides of the debate seem to assume, the climate lobby’s policy agenda follows inexorably. It does not. Climate policy advocates need to do a much better job of quantitatively analyzing economic costs and the actual, rather than symbolic, benefits of their policies. Skeptics would also do well to focus more attention on economic and policy analysis. To arrive at a wise policy response, we first need to consider how much economic damage climate change will do. Current models struggle to come up with economic costs commensurate with apocalyptic political rhetoric. Typical costs are well below 10% of gross domestic product in the year 2100 and beyond. That’s a lot of money—but it’s a lot of years, too. Even 10% less GDP in 100 years corresponds to 0.1 percentage point less annual GDP growth. Climate change therefore does not justify policies that cost more than 0.1 percentage point of growth. If the goal is 10% more GDP in 100 years, pro-growth tax, regulatory and entitlement reforms would be far more effective. Yes, the costs are not evenly spread. Some places will do better and some will do worse. The American South might be a worse place to grow wheat; Southern Canada might be a better one. In a century, Miami might find itself in approximately the same situation as the Dutch city of Rotterdam today.	Climate Change Isn’t the End of the World	partially false

1a46b040	Howl, beat your head against the wall, tear your hair and despair of this country. How can it be that nearly half the population thinks the reason people lost their jobs in the pandemic was due to their own underperformance? Just 31% attribute it to bad luck. Look around every city and town to see the shuttered shops, closed offices, boarded-up pubs, bars and restaurants, the blindingly obvious signs of the mass loss of jobs. Yet again those on the left are forced to confront some dismal realities about British public attitudes.  King’s College London’s deep research into how people feel about inequality is enough to all but extinguish political hope. It’s nice to know that Labour supporters are kinder than their Tory counterparts, but even so, a shocking 39% of Labour voters think it’s people’s own fault they lost their jobs, as this week the unemployment rate hit 5%, with worse to come.  Why does it keep shocking us, since the British people have most commonly voted in Conservative governments, with Labour crushed again and again? The Brexit vote came as the heaviest hammer-blow in living memory, followed by Boris Johnson’s triumph. This research shows that enthusing the public with a strong enough will to significantly reduce inequality requires exceptionally clever efforts of persuasion.  “There is no widespread appetite for change,” concludes the final section of this devastating report. What a blow to all of us who hope this crisis can be a 1945 moment, that the state’s massive intervention for the survival of so many might have whetted the appetite for more. “We should not expect a widespread reappraisal of the case for greater government intervention in the economy, despite the economic hardship wrought by the pandemic,” is the sobering conclusion.  Its lead author, Professor Bobby Duffy, long-time Ipsos Mori researcher on social attitudes, reminded me that there has been historic change for the better in attitudes on race, gender and sexuality, and that younger people are considerably more progressive than those who are old. But when I talked to him, he warned that attitudes can change again: “It doesn’t mean there won’t be backsliding.”  He warned on race that a fixed 13% have toxic racist attitudes. A quarter of people think Covid causing a rise in ethnic inequality wouldn’t be problem, though 67% say it would. Gender inequality ranks low as a concern, possibly because an older generation remember how much that has already improved.  Here’s the great political gulf, which interestingly falls along Brexit-related lines: two-thirds of Labour remainers believe the crisis justifies more state intervention, compared to only one in five Conservative leavers. The pandemic has barely shifted views, despite all that clapping for carers and key workers. While 82% of Labour remainers believed Britain was unequal before the coronavirus outbreak, that view is shared by just 53% of Conservative leavers. What should be done about it now? That depends on how the question is phrased: use the word “redistribution” and support for action is just 48%, but phrase it as “government should take measures to reduce differences in income levels” and support rises to 62%. Tax those who are very rich and companies, but not themselves, is roughly how that translates, as in much other polling.  The one question of disadvantage on which most agree is inequality of place. Some 61% agree that inequalities between more and less deprived areas are the most serious kind. Paul Johnson, head of the IFS, for whom this research forms part of its Deaton Review of Inequalities, finds this startling. He puzzles over whether people mean north and south, say Burnley versus Twickenham, or do they, he hopes, mean the divide between poor and rich districts everywhere? London, for example, may have grotesque wealth among City bankers, but it has the most poverty too, and he says, is by far the hardest hit by unemployment caused by the pandemic. Averages deceive wickedly.  “Take the real divide between graduates and non-graduates,” Johnson says. “After counting housing costs, a graduate in Burnley has the same income as one in Twickenham, but lots more graduates living in Twickenham give it a high average.” Can that simple fact be explained, so people realise that levelling up is not just big projects in the north, but levelling up low incomes everywhere?  These findings will warm the cockles of Conservative hearts, but present painful dilemmas for Labour. Tackling inequality is Labour’s great cause, but that may be a rebarbative word with too many voters. Paul Johnson recalls, “Tony Blair never mentioned inequality, yet with tax credits, did more than any government to ease poverty.” Blair spoke instead of “social exclusion”. Those who criticise Keir Starmer for his caution should study this report in depth.  Most depressing is how many people attribute success and failure only to hard work and ambition: people believe this is a meritocracy, not a system governed by birth and luck. Prof Duffy talked of how since the 1970s individual blame has replaced systemic injustice as people’s explanation for inequality. Britain was at its most equal in 1975, but with the blast of Thatcherism that took the lid off top earnings and saw bottom earnings fall back, came a dose of Americanised individualism. More than half the workforce belonged to a union in the 1970s, and they were vectors not just of power, but political education. Now only 23% are members and unions’ political influence is weak in public discourse. The collective is replaced with a warped idea of merit, disseminated by the right, deliberately ignoring the social injustices that predestine futures from birth.  Because we have to live in hope, and yet also cleave to realism, this research suggests the best way to engage voters with inequality is through locality and place. But whisper the word.

c1e124d5	People with lung cancer are dying after being diagnosed late in A&E because their GP missed signs of the disease despite often repeated visits, experts have revealed.  As many as 56% of people in some parts of England who get lung cancer are only diagnosed when they visit A&E, according to a report by the UK Lung Cancer Coalition.  They are five times more likely to die within a year than those whose condition has been identified either by their GP or through the NHS cancer screening programme.  Family doctors often fail to diagnose cases of lung cancer until it is too late to treat effectively or miss them altogether, leading patients to seek help at A&E, the report says.  More than a third of lung cancer patients see their GP three or more times before being referred for tests. That is a key factor in the UK’s poor record, in international terms, at diagnosing the disease early.  Lung cancer is the third commonest form of cancer in the UK and the biggest cancer killer, claiming 35,000 lives a year.  “People diagnosed in A&E are dying as a result of delays in identifying their illness. Late diagnosis makes lung cancer harder to treat and is a major reason why we have such poor survival in the UK,” said Prof Mick Peake, chair of the coalition’s clinical advisory group.  It is “a travesty” that admission to hospital as a medical emergency is the single commonest way the disease is diagnosed, added Peake, who is also the clinical director of the Centre for Cancer Outcomes at University College Hospital London.  GPs’ failure to spot symptoms of lung cancer is only one reason for Britain’s low rate of early diagnosis and high rate of lung cancer mortality, Peake stressed.  However, he added: “There is good evidence that there are missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis in primary care and we strongly urge GPs to have a low threshold for doing a chest X-ray or CT scan in patients where there is any suspicion of lung cancer.”  Patients’ reluctance to have symptoms, such as a persistent cough, checked out can delay diagnosis too, especially those from poorer households and older people.  NHS data cited by Peake shows a postcode lottery in which Tower Hamlets in east London has the highest proportion of patients whose disease is diagnosed in A&E – 56.2% – closely followed by Manchester 56.1% and Leeds south and east 54%.  More than 50% of patients are also diagnosed in A&E in Salford, Hull, South Tyneside and Sunderland.  In contrast, only 14.7% of sufferers in Guildford and Waverley in Surrey are diagnosed that way, with low rates also in Wokingham in Berkshire 15.7% and Harrogate 16%.  Dr Moira Fraser-Pearce, director of policy, campaigns and influence at Macmillan Cancer Support, said that staff shortages in NHS cancer services and heavy workloads were exacerbating the complex reasons for the high level of diagnosis in A&E.  Macmillan has helped NHS England develop a new way of screening smokers and other high-risk patients for lung cancer by offering tests in trucks, often situated in supermarket car parks.  The NHS did not comment directly on the findings but a spokesperson said that: “The NHS is catching more cancers earlier when they are easier to treat, resulting in record lung cancer survival rates.”  Targeted lung health checks in locations such as supermarket car parks will detect “thousands more cases of cancer that might not have been detected otherwise, saving even more lives”, they added.  NHS England has pledged to diagnose three in four cases of cancer at an early stage by 2028. Currently 57% of lung cancers are diagnosed late, greatly reducing chance of survival.

8209ca7b	The average convicted criminal serving a short prison sentence has previously carried out more than 55 offences, police figures reveal.  Some repeat offenders are being sent to jail for the first time after committing 100 or more different crimes, according to the data.  The numbers – slipped out by ministers this month – suggest that most criminals going to prison have already been convicted of multiple offences in the past.  The i politics newsletter cut through the noise Email address is invalid Thank you for subscribing! Sorry, there was a problem with your subscription.  Conservative MPs claimed the revelation proves the justice system is too soft on offenders, while reformers accused the Government of failing to rehabilitate criminals and relying too much on prisons.  Offences history  In response to a written question from Tory backbencher Philip Davies, the Ministry of Justice said that the average man given a jail sentence of less than six months had committed 56.6 offences resulting in a conviction or caution, while women in the same position had 60.4 previous offences.  The figures also showed that last year, there was one offender who had carried out 93 different crimes before being sent to jail for the first time. In 2018, at least two first-time prisoners had previously been convicted of more than 100 offences.  The data come from the Police National Computer, which covers all police forces across the UK.  Mr Davies, the MP for Shipley, told i: “These figures absolutely destroy the liberal-leftie orthodoxy on the criminal justice system. Before people are given a short prison sentence they are given community sentence after community sentence, and this is proof that community sentences don’t work.”  But Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran argued that the data “expose a systemic failure to rehabilitate those convicted of crimes, and to prevent reoffending”. She added: “It is deeply hypocritical of the Government to talk tough on crime and grandstand on police numbers, whilst also failing to invest in rehabilitation and prevention initiatives.”  Andrew Neilson of the Howard League for Penal reform added: “Sending people to prison for short spells is particularly ineffective, as these figures reveal. Most people serving short prison sentences have done so before, and will almost certainly do so again. It simply isn’t working.”  The Minister of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.

e2abfbe6	The Labour Party has accused the Government of failing patients after the Chancellor buried a £30 billion cut to day to day spending in the Department of Health and Social Care, as waiting lists hit a record high.  Leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer will visit a hospital in Derby this morning Thursday, as Budget documents revealed a planned cut in day to day spending in the Department of Health and Social Care of £30.1 billion from April this year.  It comes as new analysis published by the Labour Party reveals that:  The number of patients waiting more than 18 weeks for treatment has increased by over 500% over the last decade.  Almost a quarter of a million people are waiting more than a year for treatment.  An estimated 4.59 million people are currently on the waiting list for treatment – the highest ever number on record.  Even before the pandemic hit, the number of people waiting more than 18 weeks had spiralled over the previous nine years, to over 720,000 in December 2019.  Only 68% of patients on the waiting list have been waiting 18 weeks or less – the statutory target for 92% of patients to receive treatment within 18 weeks of referral has not been met since 2016.  The figures include patients waiting for hip and knee replacements and cataract removals, among many other procedures and treatments vital to people’s quality of life.  NHS England spending will fall from £147.7 billion this year to £139.1 billion from next despite the ongoing costs to the NHS from Covid and the huge backlog of cases and waiting lists that have built up during the crisis.  In November, the Health Foundation estimated that clearing the backlogs and reducing waiting times would cost around £2 billion a year over the next three years.  Commenting on the findings, Jonathan Ashworth MP, Shadow Health and Social Care Secretary, said:  “The Chancellor is failing patients, our NHS and its staff by cutting frontline services during a pandemic.  “With lists already at a record high, this will mean patients waiting even longer in pain for vital treatment.  “Yesterday’s Budget papered over the cracks rather than rebuilding the foundations of our country.”	Chancellor failing patients with his £30 billion NHS cut as waiting lists hit record high	false

The recommendations to be delivered by 2021 include:  an end to the practice of sending people out of their local area for acute inpatient care  providing mental health care to 70,000 more children and young people  supporting 30,000 more new and expectant mothers through maternal mental health services  new funding to ensure all acute hospitals have mental health services in emergency departments for people of all ages  increasing access to talking therapies to reach 25% of those who need this support  a commitment to reducing suicides by 10%  Responding to the report, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said:  We have made monumental strides in the way we treat mental illness in this country — but we must go even further. Our shared vision of a 7 day mental health service means people will get the care they need, when they need it, and will help prevent mental illness in the first place.  One in 4 people will experience a mental health problem and the cost of mental ill health to the economy, the NHS and society as a whole is £105 billion a year.  This announcement will accelerate the progress that has already been made, including:  increasing the money put into mental health every year since 2010, giving the NHS a record £11.7 billion last year  introducing the first ever access and waiting time standards for mental health, meaning people will get the care they need when they need it  investing £1.4 billion to transform young people’s mental health services  Alistair Burt, minister for mental health, said:	New investment in mental health services	other
47423bb6	More than four million calls to the taxman are going unanswered, new figures show, as HM Revenue & Customs concedes the problem is almost twice as bad as previously disclosed.  More than one in 10 callers to HMRC fails to get through to anyone, compared with just over one in 20 a year ago, prompting criticism from MPs that the service is letting down millions of self-employed people.  The true scale of the problem is even worse than HMRC is prepared to admit, as its audit ignores taxpayers who get an engaged tone when they dial the tax advice helpline.  HMRC’s own figures also reveal that 14 per cent of calls took more than 10 minutes to answer, though that does not include the time people spend navigating its automated call handling service, which can add an extra four minutes to the length of a call.  In September, the month before the deadline for paper tax returns, one in five calls took more than 10 minutes to answer.  It comes despite HMRC’s claims that it has improved its performance following previous criticism of its tax advice telephone service.

More than 500,000 savers have opened the accounts after being told by George Osborne, the former chancellor, that it provided “direct government support” for those saving for a deposit, as a way of getting “Generation Rent” on to the housing ladder.  But on Friday it emerged that a flaw in the scheme means a 25 per cent government “bonus” on savings will not be paid out until the sale has completed.  Experts say this renders the scheme technically useless as it is designed for those who are struggling to find the initial outlay involved in buying a home and means they will still be reliant on loans from their parents, if available.

4a1a9b9f	Dringende Maßnahmen zur Erhöhung der Anzahl von Kindern und Jugendlichen, die lebensrettende Impfungen erhalten, werden heute vom Premierminister dargelegt. Boris Johnson wird ein Krankenhaus im Südwesten besuchen und eine Reihe von Maßnahmen zur Verbesserung der Impfraten darlegen, darunter für Masern, Mumps und Röteln MMR. Während das Vertrauen in das weltweit führende Impfprogramm des Vereinigten Königreichs nach wie vor hoch ist – mit einer Inanspruchnahme von über 90 % bei den meisten Impfungen für Kinder –, gab es in den letzten Jahren einen kleinen, aber stetigen Rückgang der Durchimpfung. Dies bedeutet, dass das Vereinigte Königreich seinen „masernfreien“ Status bei der Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO verloren hat – drei Jahre nachdem das Virus im Land eliminiert wurde. Die WHO hat erklärt, dass in den ersten sechs Monaten des Jahres 2019 weltweit fast dreimal so viele Masernfälle gemeldet wurden wie zur gleichen Zeit im Vorjahr. Masern sind heute in Ländern wie Frankreich, Deutschland und Italien endemisch. Der Premierminister hat nun die Gesundheitsführer aufgefordert, ihre Bemühungen zu erneuern, um 95 % für beide MMR-Dosen zu erreichen. Derzeit erhalten nur 87 % der Kinder ihre zweite Impfdosis, was wahrscheinlich zur Verbreitung von Masern beigetragen hat. Zu den Maßnahmen, um dies zu erreichen, gehören: Schreiben des NHS England an Hausärzte, in dem sie aufgefordert werden, „Nachhol-Impfprogramme“ für MMR für 10- bis 11-Jährige sowie für alle 5- bis 25-Jährigen zu fördern, die nicht zwei Impfdosen erhalten haben; Stärkung der Rolle lokaler Impfkoordinatoren – Gesundheitsfachkräfte, die Impfungen fördern, insbesondere bei schwer erreichbaren Familien. Dazu gehören die Unterstützung von Gebieten mit geringer Inanspruchnahme und die Anpassung spezifischer lokaler Interventionen an unzureichend geimpfte Gemeinschaften; Auf die Bedenken der Eltern in Bezug auf Impfstoffe eingehen, indem die Ratschläge auf NHS.uk aktualisiert werden, um insbesondere irreführende Informationen über die Gefahren von Impfstoffen anzugehen, indem den Menschen vom NHS genehmigte, evidenzbasierte und vertrauenswürdige Ratschläge zu Impfstoffen gegeben werden, einschließlich über eine neue Website; Einberufung eines Gipfeltreffens von Social-Media-Unternehmen, um zu diskutieren, wie sie ihren Beitrag zur Förderung genauer Informationen über Impfungen leisten können; und das Ministerium für Gesundheit und Soziales, das in Zusammenarbeit mit Public Health England und NHS England eine umfassende Strategie zur Lösung des Problems im Herbst vorlegt. Vor dem Krankenhausbesuch sagte Premierminister Boris Johnson: Nach einer Zeit des Fortschritts, in der wir Großbritannien einst für masernfrei erklären konnten, haben wir in diesem Jahr nun Hunderte von Masernfällen im Vereinigten Königreich gesehen. Ein Fall dieser schrecklichen Krankheit ist zu viel, und ich bin entschlossen, unsere Bemühungen zur Bekämpfung ihrer Ausbreitung zu verstärken. Dies ist eine globale Herausforderung, und es gibt eine Reihe von Gründen, warum Menschen sich oder ihren Kindern nicht die Impfstoffe geben, die sie benötigen, aber wir müssen in unserem gesamten Gesundheitswesen und in der Gesellschaft entschlossen handeln, um sicherzustellen, dass die Gemeinschaften ordnungsgemäß geimpft sind. Von der Beruhigung der Eltern über die Sicherheit von Impfstoffen bis hin zur Sicherstellung, dass die Menschen an Nachsorgeterminen teilnehmen, können und müssen wir mehr tun, um die Ausbreitung ansteckender, behandelbarer Krankheiten im heutigen Großbritannien zu stoppen. Gesundheitsminister Matt Hancock sagte: „Es ist leicht zu vergessen, wie verheerend Masern sein können, gerade weil Impfstoffe so wirksam sind, um sie von vornherein zu verhindern. Mit dieser Strategie wird das gesamte Gesundheitssystem zusammenkommen, um sich erneut auf Impfungen zu konzentrieren – insbesondere für unsere Kinder – und dieses Mal werden wir Masern endgültig beseitigen. Der Besuch des Premierministers im Südwesten ist Teil einer Reihe von Besuchen in Krankenhäusern, die er durchführt. Er wird Ärzte und Krankenschwestern treffen und direkt von ihnen hören, welche Unterstützung der NHS ihrer Meinung nach benötigt, damit er weiterhin der beste Gesundheitsdienst der Welt sein kann. Masern-Eliminierungsstatus bedeutet, dass das Virus nicht mehr dauerhaft in einem Land zirkuliert. Das Vereinigte Königreich erreichte 2016 nach drei Jahren begrenzter Verbreitung aufgrund hoher Impfraten den Status „masernfrei“, aber seitdem breiten sich Masern im Vereinigten Königreich seit über 12 Monaten langsam aus. Im ersten Quartal 2019 gab es in Großbritannien 231 bestätigte Masernfälle. Viele davon wurden im Ausland erworben, wobei sich einige in untergeimpften Gemeinden weiter ausbreiteten. Die Strategie des Gesundheitsministeriums, die im Herbst veröffentlicht werden soll, soll außerdem: Den NHS auffordern, Technologie einzusetzen, um festzustellen, wer möglicherweise eine Impfung verpasst hat, und die Buchung von Terminen zu vereinfachen, z. B. verbesserte Anruf-/Rückrufsysteme für diejenigen, die auf Impfungen zugreifen, und mehr konsequente Nutzung dieser Systeme im gesamten britischen Gesundheitswesen, um die Menschen an ihre Impftermine zu erinnern. Untersuchen Sie im Rahmen der Vertragsüberprüfung für Allgemeinmediziner umfassendere Fragen zur Verbesserung der Kapazität von Allgemeinmedizinern, um zusätzliche Impftermine zu ermöglichen – und bitten Sie NHS England gleichzeitig, andere Einstellungen außerhalb eines Allgemeinmediziners für Impfungen in Betracht zu ziehen. Entwickeln Sie eine große Kampagne mit NHS England und Improvement, Public Health England und Hausarztpraxen, um die Bedeutung wichtiger Impfungen zum Schutz vor potenziell gefährlichen Krankheiten zu unterstützen. Arbeiten Sie mit dem DFE zusammen, um weitere Möglichkeiten zu erkunden, wie Schüler über ihre Gesundheit und ihr Wohlbefinden informiert werden können, einschließlich des Werts von Impfungen – und ihnen ermöglichen, Fehlinformationen, die online über bestimmte Impfstoffe verbreitet werden, kritisch zu bewerten. Dies ist Teil einer umfassenderen Initiative der Regierung zur Prävention nach der Veröffentlichung des Präventions-Grünbuchs im letzten Monat. Die Leiterin der Immunisierung bei Public Health England, Dr. Mary Ramsay, sagte: „Der Verlust unseres ‚masernfreien‘ Status ist eine deutliche Erinnerung daran, wie wichtig es ist, dass jede berechtigte Person geimpft wird. Die Elimination kann nur aufrechterhalten werden, indem die Abdeckung des MMR-Impfstoffs aufrechterhalten und verbessert wird. Masern sind eine der ansteckendsten Krankheiten der Menschheit – nur eine Person, die in ein Gebiet mit niedrigeren Impfraten zurückreist, kann zu einem Ausbruch führen. Jeder, der nicht zwei Dosen MMR-Impfstoff erhalten hat, ist immer gefährdet.	Wer sind die Brandstifter, die ländliche Brände im Staat Washington legen?	false
6d16fa40	Von Ken Allen Der AFSCME Council 75 vertritt die Arbeiter in der überwiegenden Mehrheit der staatlichen Justizvollzugsanstalten in Oregon. Unsere Mitglieder arbeiten hart daran, die Öffentlichkeit zu schützen, während sie mit Insassen arbeiten, die in 13 Gefängnissen im ganzen Bundesstaat inhaftiert sind. Während die Mehrheit unserer Mitglieder Vollzugsbeamte sind, vertreten wir unter anderem auch Berater, Zahnärzte, Mitarbeiter der Gastronomie, Krankenschwestern, Wartungs- und Büroangestellte. Diese Jobs sind hart, stressig und manchmal gefährlich. Die Legislative und der Gouverneur von Oregon erwägen derzeit, wie ein Haushaltsloch von 340 Millionen US-Dollar geschlossen werden kann, da die Steuereinnahmen geringer sind als erwartet, als sie im vergangenen Mai prognostiziert wurden. Ein Teil eines am ersten Tag der diesjährigen Legislaturperiode angekündigten Haushaltsabkommens würde die Santiam Correctional Institution südöstlich von Salem schließen. Die geschätzten Einsparungen nach der Schließung im Juni würden 1,6 Millionen US-Dollar betragen. Der Gouverneur und die Legislative sollten diesen Plan überdenken. Der Schließungsplan und die Zahlen passen nicht zusammen. Die Schließung ist eine reflexartige Reaktion auf ein echtes Haushaltsproblem. Die Santiam Correctional Institution hält 440 Insassen. Es handelt sich um eine Einrichtung der Mindestsicherheit. In der Regel sind Einrichtungen mit minimaler Sicherheit am billigsten zu betreiben, gefolgt von Einrichtungen mit mittlerer Sicherheit, wobei Einrichtungen mit maximaler Sicherheit die höchsten Kosten pro Insasse aufweisen. Der Gesetzesplan sieht vor, keinen der 440 Insassen freizulassen, sondern sie in andere Gefängnisse in ganz Oregon zu bringen. Nach dem aktuellen Plan würden 50 Prozent dieser Insassen mit minimaler Sicherheitsstufe dann in einer teureren Einrichtung mit mittlerer Sicherheitsstufe inhaftiert. Alle 440 Insassen würden in ein bereits überfülltes Gefängnissystem geschoben. Wir haben 395 Insassen, die in dreistöckige Zellen geschoben wurden, die für zwei Insassen bestimmt waren und in Klassenzimmern und Bereichen untergebracht waren, die für die Arbeit der Insassen vorgesehen waren. Wir haben Einheiten, die für 80 Insassen mit 120 Insassen bestimmt waren, wobei nur ein Vollzugsbeamter diese Insassen beaufsichtigte. Wir haben Einheiten mit toten Winkeln, einschließlich ohne Sichtverbindung zum Badezimmer, mit nur einem Vollzugsbeamten, der 80 bis 100 Insassen überwacht. Der Plan, 440 weitere Insassen in ein überfülltes System zu schicken, würde gefährliche und gefährliche Arbeit für unsere Mitglieder und die Insassen schaffen. Die Überbelegung der Gefängnisse führt zu Übergriffen auf das Personal und andere Insassen und zu Gerichtsverfahren. Das Department of Corrections glaubt, dass es die Einrichtung aufgrund des Wachstums der Insassenbevölkerung 12 bis 18 Monate später wiedereröffnen müsste. Die Führung dieser Gewerkschaft ist gegen die Schließung des Werks in Santiam. Die Abteilungsleitung hat den Gesetzgeber gebeten, sie die Kürzungen in Höhe von 1,6 Millionen US-Dollar im Haushalt der gesamten Abteilung finden zu lassen. Die Gesetzgeber sollten ihre Arbeit tun, um den Haushaltsbedarf zu überwachen, aber keiner von ihnen hat jemals ein Gefängnis betrieben. Lassen Sie die Manager und Mitarbeiter des Department of Corrections einen Plan erstellen, um 1,6 Millionen Dollar einzusparen. Schließen Sie die Santiam Correctional Institution nicht. Ken Allen ist Geschäftsführer des Oregon Council 75 der American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.	Zahlen zeigen, dass Diabetes-Rezepte den NHS jetzt 1 Milliarde Pfund kosten	false
31d75b45	Bernie Sanders, ein Unabhängiger, vertritt Vermont im Senat und ist ein Kandidat für die Nominierung der Demokraten für das Präsidentenamt. Die Amerikaner verdanken viele unserer Freiheiten denen, die ihr Leben für die Gleichberechtigung der Rassen aufs Spiel setzen: Menschen wie Fannie Lou Hamer, Medgar Evers und Daisy Bates. Aber zwischen weißen und schwarzen Amerikanern besteht ein rassisches Wohlstandsgefälle von 10 zu 1, und dieses Gefälle, zusammen mit den Auswirkungen des Rassismus, schürt Ungleichheiten in Bereichen, die von der Gesundheitsversorgung bis zum Wohnen und von der College-Verschuldung bis zur strafrechtlichen Verurteilung reichen. Viele schwarze Amerikaner sind desillusioniert über Politiker, die sich für die Organisationskraft schwarzer Frauen einsetzen, wenn es an der Zeit ist, die Stimme abzugeben, aber ihre Bedürfnisse zwischen den Wahlzyklen vernachlässigen. Sie haben es satt, dass Politiker sinnvolle, aber unzureichende Reformen anbieten – und den Fortschritt auf die Straße treten, anstatt ihr politisches Kapital einzusetzen, um für Reformen zu kämpfen, die die heutigen Generationen dringend brauchen. Sie sind es leid, hinter Gruppen, die die Macht des Geldbeutels oder die Macht der demografischen Mehrheit haben, an zweiter Stelle zu stehen. Und sie haben gesagt, genug ist genug: Der Status quo ist einfach unzureichend. Ich könnte nicht mehr zustimmen. Strukturelle Probleme erfordern strukturelle Lösungen, und das Versprechen eines bloßen „Zugangs“ hat den schwarzen Amerikanern in diesem Land niemals die Gleichberechtigung garantiert. Fünfundsechzig Jahre nach Brown gegen das Board of Education of Topeka ist Bildung getrennt und ungleich geblieben. „Zugang“ zur Gesundheitsversorgung ist ein leeres Versprechen, wenn Sie sich hohe Prämien, Zuzahlungen oder Selbstbehalte nicht leisten können. Und eine „Chance“ für eine gleichberechtigte Bildung ist nur dann eine Chance im Namen, wenn Sie es sich nicht leisten können, in einem guten Schulbezirk zu wohnen oder Studiengebühren zu zahlen. Arbeitsplätze, Gesundheitsfürsorge, Strafjustiz und Bildung sind miteinander verbunden, und Fortschritte werden nicht erzielt, wenn wir uns nicht mit den Wirtschaftssystemen befassen, die die Amerikaner an ihrer Wurzel unterdrücken. Wie Keeanga Yamahtta-Taylor von Princeton kürzlich argumentierte: „In diesem Land gibt es kein Rennen ohne Klasse.“ Doch die meisten Politiker werden die Rolle nicht anerkennen, die unser Wirtschaftssystem bei der Aufrechterhaltung der Rassenungleichheit spielt. Beispiel für Beispiel zeigt, dass schwarze Menschen überproportional von der Ausbeutung durch Unternehmen betroffen sind. Schwarze Amerikaner verloren 40 Prozent ihres Vermögens in der Immobilienkrise von 2009 und wurden zur Zielscheibe räuberischer Kreditgeber. Schwarze Amerikaner erhalten mit größerer Wahrscheinlichkeit als weiße Amerikaner einen Mindestlohn, und schwarze Amerikaner profitieren überproportional von einem bundesstaatlichen Mindestlohn von 15 US-Dollar pro Stunde. Walmart ist der größte private Arbeitgeber von Afroamerikanern im Land – 42 Prozent seiner Mitarbeiter sind schwarz. Und es zahlt seinen Angestellten weniger als einen existenzsichernden Lohn – selbst wenn die Familie Walton mehr Vermögen besitzt als die unteren 40 Prozent der Amerikaner. Der frühere Vizepräsident Joe Biden sagte kürzlich: „Ich glaube nicht, dass 500 Milliardäre der Grund sind, warum wir in Schwierigkeiten sind.“ Ich widerspreche respektvoll. Ich bin der Ansicht, dass jeder Präsidentschaftskandidat, der behauptet zu glauben, dass schwarze Leben wichtig sind, es mit den Institutionen aufnehmen muss, die das Leben schwarzer Menschen kontinuierlich ausgebeutet haben. Das rassische Wohlstandsgefälle bleibt zum Teil bestehen, weil die Politiker, die es schließen könnten, von genau den Unternehmensspendern finanziert werden, die weiterhin davon profitieren. Trotz des massiven Reichtums der Vereinigten Staaten besteht die große Ungleichheit weitgehend unangefochten fort, weil Mythen über rassische Unterlegenheit und die „unwürdigen Armen“ die schlimmsten Auswirkungen des ungezügelten Kapitalismus rechtfertigen. Solange sich Unternehmen auf die Gleichgültigkeit gegenüber dem Leben der Schwarzen als Deckmantel für ihre Ausbeutung verlassen können, werden sie dies auch weiterhin tun. Rashad Robinson, Geschäftsführer von Color of Change, argumentiert nachdrücklich, dass Unternehmen eine zentrale Rolle dabei spielen, „die Kräfte des Rassismus in Amerika aufrechtzuerhalten oder zu verschlimmern“, sei es durch die Förderung rassistischer Stereotypen, die Förderung der Unterdrückung von Wählern oder die Ausbeutung von Niedriglohnarbeitern, die es sind unverhältnismäßig schwarz und braun. Und er hat Recht. Die unglückliche Wahrheit ist, dass Politiker, die Schecks von Millionären und Milliardären entgegennehmen, zuerst ihren Unternehmensmitgliedern und den gewöhnlichen Amerikanern zuletzt etwas schulden. Die schwarz-weiße Vermögenslücke könnte geschlossen werden, indem man auf den extremen Reichtum ganz oben abzielt. Stattdessen fordern Politiker, die dem einen Prozent verpflichtet sind, die schwarze Mittelschicht und die weiße Mittelschicht auf, sich um Restposten zu streiten. Ich bin stolz darauf, dass unsere Kampagne von mehr Kleingeldspenden angetrieben wird als jede andere – mehr unserer Spender arbeiten bei Walmart als bei jedem anderen Unternehmen. Unsere Bereitschaft, mächtige Sonderinteressen zu übernehmen, während wir für eine universelle Gesundheitsversorgung und einen existenzsichernden Lohn kämpfen – anstelle der privaten Gefängnisindustrie und Steuererleichterungen für die Reichen – ist eine direkte Folge der finanziellen Unabhängigkeit meiner Kampagne. Der direkteste Weg zur Rassengleichheit führt über das eine Prozent. Ein System, in dem wir nicht sowohl rassische als auch wirtschaftliche Unterschiede ansprechen, ist ein System, in dem einige Menschen, insbesondere Afroamerikaner, zurückgelassen werden. Wir sollten uns nicht von denen beeinflussen lassen, die versuchen würden, uns dazu zu zwingen, das eine dem anderen vorzuziehen.

073f3552	EXKLUSIV: Drittel der Fälle von Terroristen, Mördern und Lags gewonnen EXKLUSIV von TOM NEWTON DUNN, Politikredakteur 17. August 2015, 23:01 Uhr Aktualisiert: 5. April 2016, 20:00 Uhr EIN DRITTEL von denen, die bei der Europameisterschaft gegen Großbritannien gewonnen haben Gerichtshof für Menschenrechte Terroristen, Gefangene oder Kriminelle sind, zeigen Zahlen. Unter den Klägern, denen das Gericht seit 1975 stattgegeben hat, sind Mörder, Terroristen im Irak und bewaffnete IRA-Kämpfer. Zu den jüngsten umstrittenen Urteilen gehört die Ablehnung eines Abschiebungsbefehls des Innenministeriums für den islamischen Hassprediger Abu Qatada und die Forderung, dass Gefangene das Wahlrecht haben müssen. Die Zahlen, die zeigen, dass die 297 Siege gegen das Vereinigte Königreich 94 Gefangene, Terroristen oder Kriminelle umfassten, werden in einem Hochglanzdossier enthüllt, das von der EGMR unterstützenden Interessengruppe RightsInfo erstellt wurde. Es ist eine Reaktion auf die Kritik am Straßburger Gericht durch Tory-Minister und The Sun. Der Vorsitzende des Commons Justice Committee, Bob Neill MP, sagte: „Das geht weit über das hinaus, was jeder vernünftige Mensch als echte Menschenrechte bezeichnen würde. „Es ist Mission Creep, ein Gesetz, das von Richtern gemacht wird, die keine Richter sind, und viele aus Ländern mit fragwürdigen Menschenrechten und sehr wenig juristischer Erfahrung. „Politische Interessengruppen nutzen diese Naivität aus, die den britischen Steuerzahler erhebliche Summen kostet.“ Es kostet 286 Millionen Pfund pro Jahr, um das Leitungsgremium der Euro-Richter, den Europarat, zu finanzieren, und 23 Millionen Pfund davon stammen aus britischen Steuern. Seit 1959 hat das Vereinigte Königreich nur 41 Prozent von 513 EMRK-Fällen gewonnen. Adam Wagner von RightsInfo sagte: „Menschen, die eines Verbrechens beschuldigt oder wegen Straftaten verurteilt wurden, haben auch Menschenrechte, daher ist es nicht verwunderlich, dass sie in 40 Jahren von Fällen eine Rolle gespielt haben.“ Der fanatische Hassprediger Abu Qatada Reuters 3 ABU Qatada gewann das Recht, in Großbritannien zu bleiben, anstatt in sein Heimatland Jordanien abgeschoben zu werden, nachdem EGMR-Richter sagten, es bestehe die Gefahr, dass durch Folter gewonnene Beweise in einem Terrorprozess gegen ihn verwendet werden könnten. In diesem Fall würde Qatada, der als Osama Bin Ladens rechte Hand in Europa bezeichnet wird, keinen fairen Prozess bekommen. Mit der Entscheidung des Straßburger Gerichts aus dem Jahr 2012 wurde ein Urteil der britischen Law Lords aufgehoben. Qatada war 1999 in Jordanien mangels einer Verschwörung zur Durchführung von Bombenanschlägen verurteilt worden. Er wurde schließlich 2013 zurückgebracht, nachdem Jordan zugestimmt hatte, Folterbeweise nicht zu verwenden. GEFANGENER John Hirst erlangte nach einem Urteil des Europäischen Gerichts im Jahr 2005 erstmals das Wahlrecht für verurteilte Kriminelle. Hirst hatte zuvor 2001 seinen Anspruch vor dem High Court verloren, brachte den Fall aber nach Europa und gewann. Keine britische Regierung hat zu diesem Thema Gesetze erlassen, trotz vier Urteilen zugunsten von Hirst durch das in Straßburg ansässige Gericht. Hirst, der 25 Jahre für den unprovozierten Totschlag seiner Vermieterin verbüßte, sagte: „Sie verlieren Ihren Status in der Zivilgesellschaft nicht, nur weil Sie im Gefängnis sind – Sie sind immer noch ein Mitglied der Öffentlichkeit.“ Die Menschenrechte der IRA-Männer Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis 3 ZEHN IRA-Männer, die von Soldaten und der Royal Ulster Constabulary getötet wurden, wurden verletzt, entschied der EGMR im Jahr 2001. Seine Richter sagten, die Behörden hätten es versäumt, die Todesfälle ordnungsgemäß zu untersuchen. Die britische Regierung wurde angewiesen, jeder der Familien der IRA-Männer 10.000 Pfund zu zahlen. Die Abgeordneten der Tory und Ulster Unionist sagten, das Urteil sei eine Schande und eine Beleidigung für diejenigen, die versuchten, den Frieden zu wahren. Der Unionist Ken Maginnis sagte: „Es scheint jetzt gängige Praxis zu sein, soweit es die europäischen Gerichte betrifft, dem militanten irischen Republikanismus Vorschub zu leisten.“	Europäischer Gerichtshof für die Rechte von Mördern	other
863897d7	Theresa May hat zugegeben, dass die Sozialversicherungsexperten der Regierung vor einer umstrittenen Entscheidung, 160.000 schutzbedürftigen Menschen Leistungen bei Behinderung zu verweigern, nicht konsultiert wurden. Der Beratende Ausschuss für soziale Sicherheit SSAC wurde nur „am Tag ihrer Einführung“ über die Änderungen der PIP für persönliche Unabhängigkeitszahlungen informiert, wurde den Abgeordneten mitgeteilt. Das Eingeständnis wurde als „empörend“ bezeichnet, da der Streit die Fragen des Premierministers dominierte und Jeremy Corbyn dazu veranlasste, die Konservativen erneut als „die böse Partei“ zu brandmarken. In der Zwischenzeit kann The Independent verraten, dass die SSAC die neuen PIP-Vorschriften nun bei einem Treffen am kommenden Mittwoch prüfen wird. Es wirft die Aussicht auf, dass das Komitee die Entscheidung kritisiert, bevor die Abgeordneten darüber abstimmen, mit einer drohenden Tory-Revolte – die vor dem 16. März geschehen muss. Die Regierung führt Notstandsgesetze ein, um die Kriterien für PIP zu verschärfen, nachdem ein Gericht entschieden hat, dass sie auch Erkrankungen wie Epilepsie, Diabetes und Demenz abdecken sollten. Das Urteil würde in den nächsten fünf Jahren mindestens 3,7 Milliarden Pfund kosten, Geld, das an „wirklich behinderte Menschen gehen sollte, die es brauchen“, sagte ein Minister – bevor er sich später entschuldigte.

Lesen Sie unsere Datenschutzerklärung Aber ein konservativer Hinterbänkler hat die Premierministerin vor einer wachsenden Revolte gewarnt und sie aufgefordert, das Urteil des Tribunals zu „ehren“. Im Unterhaus sagte der Labour-Chef: „Dies ist eine beschämende Entscheidung, die Menschen mit Demenz, Menschen mit kognitiven Störungen aufgrund eines Schlaganfalls, Militärveteranen mit posttraumatischer Belastungsstörung und Menschen mit Schizophrenie treffen wird.“ Er forderte Frau May auf, „noch einmal darüber nachzudenken“ – und die SSAC anzusprechen, die normalerweise zu vorgeschlagenen Änderungen konsultiert wird, „bevor die Vorschriften im Parlament festgelegt werden“. Als Antwort bestand der Premierminister darauf, dass niemand, der derzeit PIP erhält, „eine Kürzung seiner Leistungen sehen würde“. Sie sagte den Abgeordneten: „Was das Gericht sagte, war, dass die Vorschriften unklar waren – deshalb klären wir die Vorschriften und stellen sicher, dass sie die ursprüngliche Absicht widerspiegeln, die von diesem Parlament vereinbart wurde.“ Und sie fügte hinzu: „Der Arbeits- und Rentenminister rief den Vorsitzenden des Beratungsausschusses für soziale Sicherheit an und sprach mit ihm über die Vorschriften am Tag ihrer Einführung.“ Tim Farron, der Führer der Liberaldemokraten, sagte später: „Angesichts der Tatsache, dass diese Änderungen über 150.000 behinderte Menschen betreffen werden, ist es empörend, dass die Regierung nicht zugelassen hat, dass diese Änderungen vom Ausschuss für soziale Sicherheit berücksichtigt werden.“ Eine DWP-Sprecherin sagte, es sei erlaubt, die SSAC bei der Ankündigung neuer Vorschriften zu umgehen, wenn die Entscheidung „dringend“ sei. Und sie argumentierte, dass dies beim PIP-Urteil der Fall sei, das „drohte, die Konsistenz der Bewertungen zu untergraben und Verwirrung zu stiften“ – obwohl es im Dezember ergangen war. The Independent geht davon aus, dass das letzte Mal, als die SSAC nicht zu einer Wohlfahrtsmaßnahme konsultiert wurde, im vorherigen Parlament war, wegen Kürzungen bei den Leistungen für Migranten. Herr Corbyn griff auch die Äußerungen von George Freeman, dem Leiter der Politikabteilung der Downing Street, an und stellte fest, dass Frau May 2002 die Tories als die „böse Partei“ bezeichnete. „Ihr politischer Vorsitzender schlug vor, dass Menschen mit schwächenden Zuständen diejenigen sind, die, und ich zitiere, ‚Pillen zu Hause nehmen, unter Angstzuständen leiden und nicht wirklich behindert sind‘. Ist das nicht der Beweis, dass es die fiese Party noch gibt?“ er hat gefragt. Aber Frau May sagte, sie hoffe, dass die Abgeordneten die Entschuldigung von Herrn Freeman akzeptieren würden, die Anfang dieser Woche herausgegeben wurde. Das Gericht sagte auch, dass Antragsteller, die Unterstützung bei der Einnahme von Medikamenten benötigten, genauso beurteilt werden sollten wie diejenigen, die Therapien wie die Dialyse zu Hause durchführen.	Dr. Didier Raoult veröffentlichte neue Ergebnisse von 1.061 Coronavirus-Patienten, die mit Hdroxychloroquin mit einer Erfolgsquote von 91 % behandelt wurden. Dr. Raoult stellte fest: „Die Hydroxychloroquin-Azithromycin-Kombination ist, wenn sie unmittelbar nach der Diagnose begonnen wird, eine sichere und wirksame Behandlung von COVID-19 mit einer Sterblichkeitsrate von 0,5 % bei älteren Patienten. Es vermeidet eine Verschlechterung und beseitigt in den meisten Fällen die Persistenz und Ansteckung des Virus.“ Wir haben zuerst über den renommierten Dr. Didier Raoult geschrieben, nachdem er und sein Team französischer Forscher eine Studie durchgeführt hatten, die zeigte, dass 100 % der Coronavirus-Patienten, die eine Kombination aus Hydroxychloroquin und Azithromycin erhielten, innerhalb von 6 Tagen nach der Behandlung virologisch geheilt waren. In einer Folgestudie mit einer größeren Stichprobengröße von 80 COVID-19-Patienten stellte das Team eine klinische Verbesserung bei allen bis auf einen verstorbenen 86-jährigen Patienten und einen 74-jährigen Patienten fest, der sich noch auf der Intensivstation befindet . Das Team stellte auch fest, dass sie durch die Verabreichung von Hydroxychloroquin in Kombination mit Azithromycin in allen Fällen eine Verbesserung beobachten konnten, außer bei einem Patienten, der mit einer fortgeschrittenen Form ankam, der über 86 Jahre alt war und bei dem die Entwicklung irreversibel war , laut einem neuen Papier, das heute in IHU Méditerranée Infection veröffentlicht wurde. Wir haben jetzt neue Updates. Heute Abend sagte Dr. Oz während eines Interviews, dass Dr. Raoult dabei sei, die Ergebnisse seiner neuen Studie zu veröffentlichen. Dr. OZ gab bekannt, dass Dr. Didier Raoult inzwischen 1000 Coronavirus-Patienten mit einer Erfolgsquote von 99,3 % behandelt hat. Von den 1000 behandelten Patienten kamen 20 Patienten auf die Intensivstation und 7 Patienten starben. Dr. Raoult sagte, die Nebenwirkungen seien triviale Dinge wie Hautausschlag usw. Unten ist das Interview mit Dr. Oz, in dem er über seine Diskussion mit Dr. Raoul spricht. Das Video beginnt bei 21:42 Minuten. Dies ist ein aktualisiertes Video.

97b3e15c	2000 Jahre mittelalterliche Warmzeit leugnen, Kleine Eiszeit auf allen Kontinenten Hier geht es wieder weiter. Etwa fünf Jahre lang haben die Gläubigen die mittelalterliche Warmzeit nicht wirklich erwähnt. Zu verletzt von der Verlegenheit der Hockeyschläger-Zombie-Ausfälle. Aber es ist eine unangenehme Ära, die sie ausradieren müssen, weil keines der Expertenmodelle erklären kann, was sie verursacht hat, und es ist schwer, wegen der gleichen Temperaturen in Panik zu geraten, die Edward der Bekenner mit Ochsen und Karren überlebt hat. Und es ist schwer, die moderne Wärme als „menschengemacht“ zu bezeichnen, wenn die Natur vor 1.000 Jahren so etwas geschaffen hat. Von Michael Collett, ABC, Environmental Copy and Paste Promoter Klimawissenschaftler, die in der Zeitschrift Nature schreiben, haben herausgefunden, dass es keine Beweise für „global kohärente Warm- und Kaltperioden“ in den letzten 2.000 Jahren vor der Industrialisierung gibt. Das ist bedeutsam, denn Leugner des Klimawandels haben manchmal auf Epochen wie die sogenannte „Kleine Eiszeit“ oder die „Mittelalterliche Warmzeit“ verwiesen, um zu argumentieren, dass die aktuelle globale Erwärmung eines von mehreren ähnlichen globalen Klimaereignissen ist. Aber was die Forschung tatsächlich zeigt, ist, dass andere „Spitzenerwärmungs- und Abkühlungsereignisse“ in den letzten zwei Jahrtausenden scheinbar lokalisiert waren, während die vom Menschen verursachte globale Erwärmung, die in den letzten 150 Jahren beobachtet wurde, in ihrem globalen Ausmaß beispiellos ist (ganz zu schweigen von seine absoluten Temperaturen). Wer leugnet eine Million Rohdatenpunkte? Diese neue globale Temperaturrekonstruktion des Pages Consortium stimmt auf wundersame Weise mit den Modellen überein, widerspricht jedoch Hunderten von Stalagmiten, Korallen, Eisbohrkernen, Bäumen, Seesedimenten, Schlamm vom Meeresboden, Pollenstaub und 6.000 Bohrlöchern. Es widerspricht der Geschichte von Völkern wie den Wikingern. Es widerspricht Pflanzen, die gewachsen sind, und Bäumen, die „über der Schneegrenze“ überlebt haben, was nicht sollte. Diese Karte zeigt nur einige Temperaturschätzungen aus der ganzen Welt während des Mittelalters im Vergleich zu heute. Viele dieser Artikel stammen von Craig Idso von CO2Science.org, der das Medieval Warm Period Project betreut. Als ich 2009 diese Karte für das Skeptics Handbook II erstellte, war das eine Premiere. Selbst damals gab es bereits 442 separate Forschungsinstitute aus 41 Ländern, die Artikel veröffentlicht hatten, die das MWP zeigten.* Auch dank Luning und Vahrenholt und dem Team von NoTricksZone. Das neueste Papier versucht zu behaupten, dass all diese Temperaturen nicht gleichzeitig aufgezeichnet wurden und dass es nicht global war. Aber wenn Proxys kombiniert werden, ist es offensichtlich, dass es so war. Auch in unserer modernen Warmzeit werden immer noch gleichzeitig Wärme- und Kälterekorde aufgestellt. Das Mittelalter war nicht anders. Nur durch das Sammeln und Kombinieren vieler Proxys können wir „den Durchschnitt“ sehen. 18 Proxies sagen uns, dass die Welt vor 1.000 Jahren gleich oder wärmer war Craig Loehle verwendete 2008 18 Nicht-Baumring-Proxys, darunter Grönland-Bohrlochdaten, Conroy-Lake-Pollen, Isotope aus Chesapeake Bay, Sargassosee, Karibisches Meer, Ergebnisse aus Höhlen in Südafrika, den Schweizer Alpen, Meeresoberflächenrekonstruktionen aus Norwegen, dem Nordpazifik und dem Südatlantik und auch andere Proxys. Die Temperaturen waren vor 1000 Jahren höher und vor 300 Jahren kühler. Wir haben mit der Erwärmung begonnen, lange bevor Autos und Kraftwerke erfunden wurden. Es gibt wenig Korrelation mit dem CO2-Gehalt. Folgendes sagen uns 120 Proxys aus der nördlichen Hemisphäre Ljungqvist et al. kombinierten 120 Proxys aller Art und fanden dieses Muster für die letzten 12 Jahrhunderte in der gesamten nördlichen Hemisphäre. Dann gibt es Christiansen et al. 2012, die 32 Proxys von der nördlichen Hemisphäre zurück bis ins Jahr 0 n. Chr. verfolgten. Hier ist die mittelalterliche Warmzeit in China Hier ist die mittelalterliche Warmzeit in der Antarktis und die Kleine Eiszeit: Nur für den Fall, dass Sie dachten, es gäbe nicht genug von der südlichen Hemisphäre. Rosenthal et al. 2013 brachten den Schwung einer Veröffentlichung heraus. Sie haben die Temperatur des Wassers rekonstruiert, das in den letzten 10.000 Jahren aus dem Pazifik in den Indischen Ozean geflossen ist und das in einer Tiefe von bis zu 900 m. Der indonesische Durchfluss ist ziemlich bedeutend für globale Meeresströmungen. Dieses Wasser war vor 1000 Jahren eindeutig wärmer als um 1970. Im Holozän war es noch einmal wärmer. 3000 heiße und kalte Jahre in einer südafrikanischen Höhle Südafrikanische Höhle dauert 3000 Jahre Quelle: Holmgren 2001. Siehe auch hier und hier in Afrikanische Rekonstruktionen. Die 7000-Jahres-Aufzeichnung des Südlichen Ozeans zeigt auch eine langfristige Abkühlung sowie die römische Warmzeit. Dann gibt es 10.000 meist heißere Jahre in Grönland Keine Diskussion über das Paläoklima ist vollständig ohne GISP: 6.000 Bohrlöcher zeigen, dass es global war Nur einige der Orte, an denen diese Bohrlöcher gegraben wurden. Sie stecken ein Thermometer in ein Loch, und überall auf der Welt gibt es ein Muster, das sich wiederholt, wenn Temperaturänderungen an der Oberfläche allmählich durch die Felsen nach unten wandern. Sicher, die Auflösung ist nackte Knochen. Die Daten werden „geglättet“. Wir können Bohrlöcher nicht verwenden, um zu wissen, ob es wärmer war als heute, und wir können nicht sagen, wie lange dieser große letzte Wärmeschub zurückliegt, aber Bohrlöcher zeigen uns, wie global diese letzte große Wärmeperiode war war. Unten ist die neueste Iteration eines Diagramms, das von 1997 bis 2008 eine wilde Entwicklung durchlief. Was konstant blieb, war, dass Bohrlöcher immer eine mittelalterliche Warmzeit und eine kleine Eiszeit zeigten, das heißt, mit Ausnahme der Zeit, in der Huang et al. Fast 20.000 Jahre Daten. Wenn in der obigen Grafik die Annahme über die Geschwindigkeit des Wärmeflusses verschoben wird, um den kühlsten Punkt mit anderen Proxys im Jahr 1680 und den wärmsten Punkt irgendwo zwischen 1000 und 1200 auszurichten, würde die Amplitude zunehmen (siehe das atemberaubende Originalpapier von 1997, das behauptete, es sei im Mittelalter viel wärmer gewesen). Diese Papiere sind keineswegs die einzigen wichtigen. Es gibt so viele andere … Also sagen Sie es der Welt – überall, wo wir hinschauen, war die Welt in den letzten 1000 Jahren, den letzten 10.000 Jahren und der letzten Milliarde heißer und kälter. h/t George, David B, Original Steve, Peter Fitzroy. Klimadaten haben längst bestätigt, dass M.W.P. und L.I.A. wurden weltweit, bei einem CO2-Mangel, auf der ganzen Erde, zur Erwärmung und Abkühlung angewendet. — Ruairi Hintergrundinformationen: REFERENZEN SEITEN 2k-Konsortium.

5285404b	Homerun-König Hank Aaron stirbt 18 Tage nach Erhalt des Moderna-Impfstoffs aus „unbekannter Ursache“.	Die Baseballlegende Hank Aaron, die am 5. Januar den COVID-Impfstoff von Moderna erhalten hatte, ist gestorben. Laut New York Times bestätigten die Atlanta Braves heute den Tod des 86-jährigen Hall of Famers, nannten aber keine weiteren Details. CNN berichtete, dass Aaron „friedlich im Schlaf“ starb und dass keine Todesursache bekannt gegeben wurde. Aaron machte Anfang dieses Monats Schlagzeilen, als er fotografiert wurde, wie er den Moderna-Impfstoff erhielt. Er sagte damals gegenüber Associated Press, dass die Impfung „mir ein wunderbares Gefühl gibt“. Er fügte hinzu: „Ich habe überhaupt keine Bedenken, wissen Sie. Ich bin ziemlich stolz auf mich, dass ich so etwas gemacht habe. … Es ist nur eine Kleinigkeit, die Millionen von Menschen in diesem Land helfen kann.“ Aaron wurde in der Gesundheitsklinik der Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta geimpft, was laut Nachrichtenberichten ein Versuch war, andere schwarze Amerikaner dazu zu inspirieren, auf den Teller zu treten und sich den Impfstoff zu holen. Die AP berichtete damals: „Diese Achtzigjährigen, ihre Ehepartner und mehrere andere Bürgerrechtler, die die Spritzen in einer brandneuen Klinik an der Morehouse School of Medicine erhielten, krempelten ihre Ärmel hoch, um die erste von zwei Dosen zu nehmen, und bestätigten dies Vermächtnis des Misstrauens vieler Afroamerikaner gegenüber der medizinischen Forschung, das auf das berüchtigte Tuskegee-Experiment zurückzuführen ist, bei dem US-Gesundheitspersonal die Syphilis bei schwarzen Männern ohne ihre Zustimmung unbehandelt ließ, wodurch sie unnötig leiden mussten.“ Im Dezember berichtete VOX über den Start einer globalen Kampagne, bei der Influencer und Prominente dazu beitragen sollen, die „Impfzögerlichkeit“ zu überwinden, und erklärte, dass sie „beispiellos sein wird“ und viele Institutionen eine Rolle spielen werden, darunter Regierungen und öffentliche Gesundheitsbehörden. Gesundheitsbeamte stoßen jedoch weiterhin auf Widerstände, auch von Mitarbeitern des Gesundheitswesens. Unerwünschte Ereignisse des COVID-Impfstoffs wurden weltweit gemeldet. Deutschland und Norwegen haben insgesamt 43 Todesfälle bei älteren Menschen gemeldet, die den Pfizer-Impfstoff erhalten haben, was chinesische Gesundheitsbehörden dazu veranlasste, die Aussetzung der Impfstoffe zu fordern, insbesondere bei älteren Menschen. Als Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Vorsitzender und Chefrechtsberater von Children’s Health Defense, von Aarons Tod erfuhr, sagte er: „Aarons tragischer Tod ist Teil einer Welle verdächtiger Todesfälle unter älteren Menschen, die kurz nach der Verabreichung von COVID-Impfstoffen erfolgt.“ „Studien zeigen, dass eigennützige Forscher von Pharmaunternehmen, Ärzte, Pflegeheime und Gesundheitsbehörden selten Impfverletzungen melden. Stattdessen tun sie Verletzungen und Todesfälle als „nicht im Zusammenhang“ mit der Impfung ab“, sagte Kennedy. „Befürworter der öffentlichen Gesundheit befürchten, dass die überwiegende Mehrheit der Verletzungen und Todesfälle nicht an das Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) gemeldet wird, das notorisch kaputte freiwillige Überwachungssystem des US-Gesundheitsministeriums (HHS).“ Eine HHS-Studie aus dem Jahr 2001 kam zu dem Schluss, dass „weniger als 1 % der Impfverletzungen“ an VAERS gemeldet werden. Wie The Defender letzte Woche berichtete, war Kalifornien gezwungen, eine Charge von 330.000 Moderna-Impfstoffen nach einer Kaskade gemeldeter Verletzungen zurückzurufen, obwohl das Unternehmen jetzt sagt, dass es in Ordnung ist, die Verabreichung dieser Charge wieder aufzunehmen. Der Verteidiger berichtete auch über die Geschichte eines 56-jährigen Arztes aus Florida, der etwa zwei Wochen nach Erhalt seiner ersten Dosis des Impfstoffs von Pfizer starb. Sein Tod wird von den Gesundheitsbehörden Floridas untersucht. Darüber hinaus wurden mehrere schwere allergische Reaktionen direkt mit dem Pfizer-Impfstoff in Verbindung gebracht.	partially false
745c07fe	"You have been sent here because your child, partner, or friend suggested that you invest your life savings into GameStop stock and you are curious what the fuck is going on. This post is long and thorough and mostly does not discuss memes and ""the internet"" until the end, but if you read it you will hopefully understand What Is Happening. What is going on is that GameStop, a company that sells physical copies of video games next to Auntie Anne’s pretzel shops in dying malls, is the most highly traded asset in the United States, a “meme stock,” and currently the primary front in a micro class war. GameStop’s stock price jumped from $4 last summer to $20 at the end of 2020, to $40 two weeks ago. It was worth $100-ish at times on Monday and Tuesday, and as I write this it is worth close to $300. Essentially, many normal-ish people have made a huge bet against gigantic financial institutions and are currently winning. In practice this means we are seeing one of the largest wealth transfers from the financial ruling class to the middle and middle-upper classes in recent memory, so it is, understandably, the only thing anyone is talking about. How did this happen? A bunch of Redditors in the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, led by a person going by ""DeepFuckingValue,"" analyzed GameStop stock and concluded that its price was undervalued. They then, over the course of months, identified a weakness in the strategies of several giant hedge funds that had bet many millions of dollars that GameStop would fail. These Redditors purchased huge numbers of GameStop stock at low prices (and then kept buying more as the prices rose), held it, and are currently forcing something known as a “short squeeze” that is driving the price up and is emptying these hedge funds in the process. These Redditors are diamond-handing (holding) their stocks, imploring each other to not be a weak-minded stock seller (paper hands) and are waiting for their messiah Ryan Cohen—the CEO of Chewy.com who invested millions in GameStop last year—to hitch them to his rocket and take them to the moon/sun/Mars (become very rich). Advertisement A few weeks ago I became interested in WallStreetBets. I bought 14 shares of GameStop, knowing that if I put a small amount of money in I would actually pay attention to the subreddit and what people were writing about. I did not expect the stock to become worth any money but now I can afford to fix my broken car. I do not have other stocks outside of my 401k. Elon Musk, random venture capitalists, and Mad Money Jim Cramer are all ancillary characters who have made cameos on this journey, and you've got a lot to catch up on: WHAT IS GAMESTOP: GameStop is the number one physical video game retailer in the United States, which means a lot less than it used to in the 1990s, and also has a bunch of stores internationally. GameStop has been closing stores and losing money over the last few years because of the slow death of retail, caused largely by digital storefronts such as Steam and companies like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo opting to sell digital copies of their titles on their own digital stores. The pandemic has also not been good for GameStop. Even though video game sales are skyrocketing, GameStop is a physical store and had to close many locations to comply with COVID-19 restrictions. Sales fell by a third in the first quarter of 2020. Advertisement This has led many financial forecasters to declare that death is inevitable for GameStop, a prognostication that led big hedge funds and capital firms to “short” GameStop stock. WHAT IS ‘SHORTING’ AND WHO IS DOING IT? “Shorting” is a bet that a company's stock will become less valuable. This is done when an investor sells shares of a stock that they do not own. Essentially, they sell shares of a stock at a certain (high) price in the belief that sometime in the near future the price of that stock will go down. They will then be able to buy the stock at the lower price to “cover” their shorts, “closing” the deal and pocketing the difference between the price they sold at and bought at as profit. This is something that giant hedge funds do all the time, often to the chagrin of CEOs like Elon Musk. Often, by betting against a company short sellers are able to put downward pressure on the stock price. What this means is that a struggling company’s stock price can go down simply because a giant hedge fund invests millions or hundreds of millions of dollars shorting it. The mere act of a hedge fund—which are smarter than everyone else, the thinking goes—betting against a company can start a news cycle where investor-types think a company is going to fail, investors sell or get scared, and the stock price goes down. The short sellers win and make a bunch of money. Advertisement Sometimes, however, short sellers lose. This happens when they bet on a stock price to go down, but it goes up instead. The important thing to remember here is that there is theoretically no limit to how much money a short seller can lose. This is because if a short seller shorts a stock at $20, the stock price can continue to go up and the short seller must, at some point, buy that stock to close its position and fulfill its side of the bargain. If I short one stock at $20 and the price of that stock goes to $1 million, I still at some point have to buy that share to close the deal. In this case I would lose $999,980. In this case, a company called Melvin Capital Management shorted millions of dollars in GameStop stock. Another company called Citron Research shorted some large amount of GameStop stock and has also spent much of the last several months explaining why GameStop is a dogshit company that is going to fail. These are companies that most (normal) people have not heard of but are a big deal in the financial world. These companies (as well as a few others), made risky bets that GameStop stock would continue to go down, allowing them to profit immensely, as they usually do. But not this time. WHAT WENT WRONG FOR MELVIN, CITRON, AND THE SHORT SELLERS, INITIALLY As I mentioned earlier, short sellers at some point have to actually buy shares of the company they’ve shorted in order to close their positions and exit their deal. If they do this when a stock's price is higher than their short, they will lock in their losses. So Citron and Melvin and other short sellers have been playing a fabulously expensive game of chicken. Because for the last few months, GameStop stock has slowly been increasing in price. Advertisement The bullish case for GameStop is predicated on the fact that it had a good earnings report earlier this month (its digital sales were up 309 percent), and also saw a big investment from a guy named Ryan Cohen, who is the cofounder of the online pet store Chewy. Chewy is a very successful company and Cohen is seen as a very competent person. Cohen revealed a nearly 10 percent stake in GameStop in September of last year, and upped his stake to nearly 13 percent in December. His investment eventually led to him joining GameStop’s board of directors with ideas like pushing digital sales in tow, which drove investor confidence in the company (because of his prior successes), and pushed the stock price up. It also drove positive media coverage, which, sometimes, can also drive stock prices up. With GME stock prices going up, Melvin, Citron, and short sellers have been waiting for a price crash to cover their positions that has never come. Advertisement The most important thing (as I understand it, at least), and a situation that happens only very rarely, is that short sellers shorted more shares of GameStop than actually exist. What this means is that even if every single short seller wanted to cut their losses and close their positions, they would be unable to do so because the shares don’t exist. Normally this isn’t that much of a problem because over time they’d be able to buy enough stock to close their positions due to people buying and selling stock back and forth. In this case, however, Redditors noticed what was going on and have royally fucked short sellers. Crucially, Redditors on WallStreetBets are holding their stocks Because people haven’t been selling the stock, and because it’s continued to go up, short sellers have been unable to cover their shorts without locking in billions in losses and are unable to cover their shorts entirely because the stock has been over shorted. Here is where things get truly complicated and beyond the scope of this blog. Essentially, you (meaning you, the average person) can buy shares at the market price, no problem. But short sellers want to see a sell-off frenzy, where prices plummet and they can buy huge numbers of shares to reduce their losses or, ideally, lock in their gains. Big short sellers needs to quite literally buy hundreds of thousands or millions of shares, and so they are left waiting for a selling frenzy that may never arrive, or won't come until GameStop has become worth many hundreds or thousands of dollars per share. Advertisement Anyways, this brings us to Reddit and WallStreetBets. WHAT IS WALLSTREETBETS This is what WallStreetBets looks like on Reddit: And this is what it looks like on Discord: And this is what it sounds like: r/WallStreetBets is a subreddit that describes itself as “4chan with a Bloomberg Terminal,” which is the laziest but probably most apt way to think of it. It is a subreddit for people who like to gamble on the stock market that has its own culture, terminology, characters, and villains. It's also very toxic, similar to 4chan. You can broadly think of WallStreetBets as a bunch of investors who think that it is very boring to take a small portion of your paycheck and invest it in your 401k and wait to get old to be rich. It is full of day traders without a ton of money who YOLO their money into a single stock (invest their life savings, or their mom’s life savings, or their student loan payments, or their paychecks), to hopefully realize a giant profit in a short period of time by taking advantage of temporary price movements. Historically, the top posts in this subreddit are “loss porn” and “gain porn,” which are screenshots of people’s investment portfolios showing how they turned a small amount of money into a huge amount of money in a short period of time, or turned a huge amount of money into a tiny amount of money in a short period of time. The broader financial investment world thinks these people are morons and degenerates, and the prevailing financial wisdom is that investing a significant amount of money into specific companies' stocks (versus index funds that mirror the entire market or an entire market sector) is very risky and best left to pros and People Who Know Better, such as giant hedge funds and billionaires. This is the type of advice that financial advisors and podcasters have to give because “take a cash advance on your credit card and invest it all into a stock symbol that you picked randomly from a Ouija board” is not defensible and not advisable to the public at large. Advertisement All of that said, the stock market has been increasingly unmoored from the actual economy, with the stock market as a whole skyrocketing in price over the last 24 months even as hundreds of thousands of people die from a pandemic, millions of people lose their jobs, and billionaires get richer while the rest of us get poorer. Picking random stocks and investing money into them has been a legitimately successful strategy for many people over this short time sample period. It surely will not last. But nonetheless it is working. WALLSTREETBETS AND GAMESTOP In September 2019, a redditor named DeepFuckingValue posted a screenshot of himself investing $53,000 into GameStop stock over the preceding few months, at prices of between 30 cents and 75 cents per share. On that day, his shares were worth $113,000, a gain of 86 percent. GameStop stock was worth 85 cents at the time. This post didn’t take off, but over the months, DeepFuckingValue, who goes by the name ""RoaringKitty"" on YouTube, continued to post updates on their GameStop YOLO. On YouTube, they laid out their case for why they invested in GameStop, which largely came down to GameStop’s strong online sales, the fact that it was closing stores (reducing costs) and that its per-store revenue was increasing as it did so. Advertisement Other redditors and DeepFuckingValue eventually caught on that something else was happening with GameStop stock: It was the most shorted stock in the entire stock market. That, combined with what DeepFuckingValue described as “strong fundamentals,” suggested that, at some point, these short sellers would be forced to close their positions. The opportunity, as I mentioned earlier, is that short sellers overextended themselves and would only be able to close their positions: A) at a loss and B) if suddenly a bunch of people who own GameStop stock sold their stock, which would drive it down. WallStreetBets at the time had more than a million subscribers, and DeepFuckingValue's gain porn was going viral on the subreddit back in December, when the stock prices were around $4. His gains led more people to invest in GameStop, further driving the price up. People began to write treatises on why they believed GameStop was a good investment, leading to more investing. All of this put more pressure on short sellers, which helped snowball the stock up, leading to unrealized gains for all. The rallying cry of the entirety of the WallStreetBets subreddit and its extraordinarily chaotic Discord became: buy GameStop stock, hold it, and fuck over the big hedge funds, specifically Melvin Capital and Citron Research, which, throughout this entire saga, was publishing various YouTube videos about why it believed GameStop stock would go down. Advertisement This created a trollish us-versus-them mentality. If you bought GameStop stock, you are cool and going to become rich. If you sell GameStop stock before you ride its rocket to Mars, you are a coward and are only helping these big hedge funds and fucking over your fellow Redditor. All throughout this, DeepFuckingValue's account went from $50k, to $100k, to several million, to $10 million, to $20 million. DeepFuckingValue did not sell their stock, as far as we know—if they could be brave enough to hold then, you, a lowly investor, could afford to also hold your stock, further driving the price up as Melvin and The Establishment began to sweat. WHY THE STOCK HAS GONE COMPLETELY BANANAS This brings us to this week. By all accounts, Melvin Capital is in deep trouble. Earlier this week, it took in $2.75 billion in funding, reportedly to help cover its GameStop shorts. A prominent venture capitalist said he was buying GameStop stock. Every financial publisher is talking about GameStop stock. Elon Musk, who, again, famously hates Tesla's short sellers with a burning passion, tweeted about GameStop stock and said that he's hanging out in the WallStreetBets Discord. Meanwhile, the GameStop shorts have seemingly not figured out an elegant way out of this. Many prognosticators and analysts on WallStreetBets have been writing posts explaining why they believe GameStop stock will go over $1,000 or $5,000 per share, which involves a scenario where banks and investment platforms themselves require short sellers to cover their shorts all at once, which will make the stock go even crazier than it already has. This seems to be the prevailing wisdom among GME investors at the moment—the stock is worth $350 as I write this, but most people on the subreddit seem unsatisfied. They are out to make a life-changing amount of money and they are out for hedge fund blood. Advertisement IS THIS ILLEGAL / WHO IS GOING TO JAIL? Probably no one is going to jail, but some hedge funds will likely go bankrupt. WallStreetBets is not “manipulating” the market, really. People are posting publicly-available information and their own analyses of what they believe a stock will do, and hundreds of thousands or millions of people are reading that analysis and acting on their own. They are largely doing what stock prognosticators do all day every day on TV shows about stocks. WHAT ABOUT NOKIA, BEST BUY, BLACKBERRY, AMC, ETC WallStreetBets is also investing heavily in Nokia, Best Buy, Blackberry, AMC Theaters, and other stocks. I am not a financial expert and don’t know what will happen with these but in the short term these stocks have also seen large gains (but smaller than GameStop). All of them have been shorted, but not shorted as heavily as GameStop. WHAT THIS ALL MEANS The financial press is trying to explain what this means for them, hedge funds, capitalism, the economy, and the stock market moving forward. Internet culture reporters are trying to explain if this is GOOD or BAD, if this is the Donald Trump-ification of the stock market, where a meme or troll gets out of control and causes unprecedented havoc on the real world. Anthony Scaramucci, of all people, is calling this the ""French Revolution of finance."" It is true that this means something and that this is likely a big moment. We are seeing, I think, the democratization of financial information, at least to some extent. While we've seen technology like deepfakes and facial recognition filter down from research firms and big companies into the hands of ordinary people and amateur technologists who then use them for whatever purposes they want, we are seeing financial technologies, information, and analysis becoming available not just to hedge fund managers, financial institutions, and the very rich, but to the masses. It is clear that there is a sect of WallStreetBets who either previously or currently work in the financial sector who are fed up with increasing inequality, are tired of watching giant corporations repeatedly fuck over ordinary people, and are explaining how it all works to huge groups of people. What they are doing is risky, but it's not ""very stupid."" We have been told for decades that the banks and the people who work at Goldman Sachs and Fidelity and hedge funds none of us have ever heard of are smarter than us, that they deserve to be rich, that they should be the ones who pull the levers on the economy, that they should decide which companies are good and which are bad, that they should be the ones who help make financial regulations. All along the way they have gotten fabulously wealthy and we have been stuck with stagnant wages, record consumer debt, and financial advice that tells us to wait until we are old to retire. WallStreetBets says this is a new paradigm where the masses have the power and hedge funds are scared. A top post on the subreddit this morning was called this: ""FOR ALL THE BIG FUCKING HEDGE FUNDS MONITORING US, THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM US TO YOU, WE FUCKING OWN YOU NOW, FUCK. YOU."" It's unclear how far this will go. After all, people with thousands of dollars to invest in GameStop still have thousands of dollars to invest with, unlike the millions of people in the U.S. currently out of work due to a deadly pandemic. The free investment app of choice, Robinhood, was also just fined by the SEC for hosing its own customers by seeking favorable rebates instead of the best prices for its users. And even if some hedge funds are getting bodied by retail investors, the massive funds such as Fidelity and Blackrock that own tens of millions of GameStop shares are probably just as happy."

3971d0e8	HOUSTON – In den Wochen seit der Wiederwahl von Präsident Obama haben sich Republikaner im ganzen Land gefragt, wie es weitergehen soll. Einige Konservative in Texas haben eine weitaus gezieltere Frage gestellt: Wie kann man sich abspalten? Das Sezessionsfieber hat Teile von Texas erfasst, das Mitt Romney mit fast 1,3 Millionen Stimmen gewann. Der Verkauf von Autoaufklebern mit der Aufschrift „Secede“ – einer für 2 $ oder drei für 5 $ – hat bei TexasSecede.com zugenommen. In Osttexas verschickte ein republikanischer Beamter einen E-Mail-Newsletter, in dem es hieß, es sei Zeit für Texas und Vermont, „in Frieden ihren eigenen Weg zu gehen“ und ein Freihandelsabkommen zwischen den Staaten zu unterzeichnen. Eine Petition mit der Forderung nach Sezession, die von einem Mann aus Texas auf einer Website des Weißen Hauses eingereicht wurde, hat Zehntausende von Unterschriften erhalten, und die Obama-Regierung muss nun eine Antwort geben. Und Larry Scott Kilgore, ein Dauerkandidat der Republikaner aus Arlington, einem Vorort von Dallas, kündigte an, dass er 2014 für das Amt des Gouverneurs kandidiere und seinen Namen legal in Larry Secede Kilgore ändern werde, wobei Secede in Großbuchstaben geschrieben werde. Auf seiner Webseite secedekilgore.com heißt es: „Secession! Alle anderen Themen können später behandelt werden.“ In Texas hat sich das Sezessionsgerede in den letzten Jahren immer mehr vom rechten Rand in die Mitte verlagert. Es hat sich zu einem Echo des Anti-Washington-, Pro-Texas-Souveränitäts-Mantras der republikanischen Führung des Bundesstaates in einer Vielzahl von Themen entwickelt, darunter Gesundheits- und Umweltvorschriften. Für einige Texaner dient das erneute Interesse an dem Thema einfach als komische Erleichterung nach einer vernichtenden Wahlniederlage.

239983c1	Ein Jahr vor den Olympischen Winterspielen in Peking 2022 hat das Internationale Olympische Komitee IOC die Athleten in den Mittelpunkt dieses Meilensteins gestellt, indem es ihre Vorbereitung und ihr Engagement für die Teilnahme an den Spielen in diesen beispiellosen Zeiten hervorgehoben hat. Athleten erzählen und kommen in selbst gefilmten Inhalten in einem Film vor, der an diesem wichtigen Datum veröffentlicht wurde. Sie werden zwischen dem 4. und 20. Februar, dem Zeitraum, in dem die Spiele des nächsten Jahres stattfinden, auch Live-Chats abhalten und die sozialen Kontakte bei @Olympics übernehmen. IOC-Präsident Thomas Bach begrüßte Athleten aus der ganzen Welt und lud heute die NOK der Nationalen Olympischen Komitees der Welt und ihre Wintersportler offiziell zur Teilnahme an den Spielen im nächsten Jahr ein. Aus Respekt vor dem Geist, dass die Spiele ein Sportereignis sind, ist es der IOC-Präsident, der die NOKs zu den Olympischen Spielen einlädt. Angesichts der aktuellen Umstände erfolgte dies heute vom Olympic House in Lausanne, Schweiz. Der IOC-Präsident unterzeichnete symbolisch und verschickte Einladungen an acht NOKs, darunter das Chinesische Olympische Komitee. Die anderen sieben NOKs waren das Griechische Olympische Komitee, das seinen Sitz im Ursprungsland der Olympischen Spiele hat; die NOKs zukünftiger Austragungsstädte der Olympischen Spiele – das Japanische Olympische Komitee für Tokio 2020; das Comité National Olympique et Sportif Français für Paris 2024; das Comitato Olimpico Nazionale Italiano für Milano Cortina 2026, den Nachfolger von Peking; und das United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee für LA28 – sowie das Australian Olympic Committee und das Nigerian Olympic Committee, die jeweils die größten Delegationen aus Ozeanien und Afrika zu den letzten Olympischen Winterspielen entsandt haben. Alle acht NOKs nahmen die Einladung per Videobotschaft an. Zu diesem Meilenstein sagte Bach: „In einem Jahr wird Peking als erste Stadt überhaupt Geschichte schreiben, die sowohl die Sommer- als auch die Winterausgabe der Olympischen Spiele ausrichten wird. Diese Spiele werden das chinesische Volk mit der Welt verbinden.“ Er fuhr fort: „Nachdem wir gesehen haben, wie China die Coronavirus-Krise überwindet, sind wir sehr zuversichtlich, dass unsere chinesischen Gastgeber in voller Zusammenarbeit mit dem IOC sichere Olympische Spiele gewährleisten werden. Jedes Mal, wenn ich China besuche, bin ich so beeindruckt von der Begeisterung und Unterstützung für die Olympischen Winterspiele Peking 2022. Deshalb können wir schon jetzt mit großer Zuversicht sagen: China ist bereit. Wir sind bereit, die weltbesten Wintersportler zu den unvergesslichen Olympischen Winterspielen 2022 in Peking willkommen zu heißen. Wir alle freuen uns auf dieses globale Fest des Sports.“ Die digital geführte Kampagne #StrongerTogether konzentriert sich auf Athleten auf der ganzen Welt und ihre Solidarität und ihren Fortschritt im Hinblick auf die Spiele. Als Teil davon hat das IOC den Film #StrongerTogether veröffentlicht, der die Vorbereitungen der Athleten auf die Spiele im nächsten Jahr zeigt und weltweit über digitale, soziale und Partnermedienkanäle verbreitet wird. Es wird von der chinesischen Freestyle-Skifahrerin Eileen Gu erzählt und zeigt ikonische Momente vergangener Olympischer Winterspiele, einen Blick auf die Austragungsorte von Peking 2022 und selbst gefilmte Inhalte von den Vorbereitungen der Athleten, während sie sich auf die Reise nach Peking 2022 vorbereiten. Eine Reihe digitaler Partnerschaften wird das Interesse an diesem Meilenstein steigern. Twitter führt eine einzigartige Emoji-Funktion aus, wenn Benutzer @Olympics mit #StrongerTogether und dem ❄️-Emoji twittern; während ein spezieller Peking 2022-Filter auf Snapchat verfügbar sein wird. Ikonische olympische Wintermomente werden täglich auf dem Olympic Channel und @Olympics Twitter veröffentlicht, und es wird Athletenübernahmen und inspirierende Gespräche auf dem Olympia-Instagram geben. Die weltweiten Olympischen Partner und Rechteinhaber des IOC werden diesen Meilenstein in den kommenden Tagen ebenfalls aktivieren. Zu den bemerkenswerten Aktivitäten, die organisiert werden, gehört die Enthüllung einer physischen Countdown-Uhr in Peking durch OMEGA, den offiziellen Zeitnehmer der Olympischen Spiele. Darüber hinaus können Fans über die olympischen und paralympischen Online-Erlebnisse, die mit dem weltweiten olympischen und paralympischen Partner Airbnb gestartet wurden, live mit Wintersportlern interagieren, von denen sich einige auf ihrem Weg nach Peking 2022 befinden. Omega In China wurde eine One Year to Go-Feiershow im nationalen Fernsehen ausgestrahlt. Neben der Feier dieses besonderen Meilensteins mit einem kulturellen Spektakel enthüllte das Organisationskomitee von Peking 2022 auch das offizielle Fackeldesign von Peking 2022. Die Veranstaltung fand im Ice Cube statt, der früher als Water Cube bekannt war und in dem Curling bei den Spielen im nächsten Jahr stattfinden wird.

Februar 2021 Die Vorbereitungen für die Spiele im nächsten Jahr in China bleiben auf Kurs und Die Aufregung steigt im ganzen Land. Alle Wettkampfstätten wurden bis Ende 2020 fertiggestellt, die restlichen Renovierungs- und Bauarbeiten sollen bis Ende dieses Jahres abgeschlossen sein. Mit dem Ziel, 300 Millionen Menschen für den Wintersport zu begeistern, und nachdem rund eine Million Bewerbungen für Freiwilligenstellen eingegangen sind, werden die Spiele 2022 in Peking sowohl für China als auch für die globale Wintersportszene von grundlegender Bedeutung sein. Vor den Olympischen Winterspielen Peking 2022 wird es Wintersport geben und danach eine neue Ära des Wintersports. Das sieht man schon an den Zahlen. Vor fünf Jahren gab es in China nur 460 Skigebiete. Bis Ende 2019 wuchs diese Zahl auf 644. Auch bei den Olympischen Winterspielen in Peking 2022 wird Nachhaltigkeit stark im Fokus stehen. Alle Veranstaltungsorte werden zu 100 Prozent mit erneuerbarer Energie betrieben, während an den meisten Eissportorten in Peking 2022 natürliche, kohlenstoffarme CO 2 -Kühlsysteme zum Einsatz kommen – das erste Mal, dass diese Technologie mit geringen Auswirkungen auf das Klima in China zum Einsatz kommt bei den Olympischen Winterspielen. Darüber hinaus werden 7 der 12 Wettkampf- und Nicht-Wettkampfstätten innerhalb der Wettkampfzone von Peking 2022 alte Austragungsorte von Peking 2008 sein. Peking wird vom 4. bis 20. Februar 2022 Gastgeber der XXIV. Olympischen Winterspiele sein. ### Das Internationale Olympische Komitee ist eine gemeinnützige, zivile, nichtstaatliche, internationale Organisation aus Freiwilligen, die sich für den Aufbau einer besseren Welt durch Sport einsetzt. Sie verteilt mehr als 90 Prozent ihrer Einnahmen an die breitere Sportbewegung, was bedeutet, dass jeden Tag umgerechnet 3,4 Millionen US-Dollar zur Unterstützung von Athleten und Sportorganisationen auf allen Ebenen auf der ganzen Welt verwendet werden. ### Für weitere Informationen wenden Sie sich bitte an das IOC Media Relations Team: Tel.: +41 21 621 6000, E-Mail: pressoffice@olympic.org, oder besuchen Sie unsere Website unter www.olympic.org.

92f7f33e	38 AKTIEN LinkedIn E-Mail Reddit Telegram Scott Israel, Sheriff von Broward County, wurde entlassen, weil er die Wahrheit über die Geschehnisse während der Schießerei in Parkland vertuscht hatte. Berichten zufolge wird Sheriff Israel nach einer strafrechtlichen Untersuchung durch den Gouverneur von Florida, Rick Scott, bereits nächste Woche ersetzt. UMGEHEN SIE DIE ZENSOREN Melden Sie sich an, um ungefilterte Nachrichten direkt in Ihren Posteingang zu erhalten. E-Mail * Von Big League Politics: Sheriff Israel wird nach einer vom Büro des Gouverneurs von Florida, Rick Scott, durchgeführten Untersuchung aus kriminellen Gründen aus dem Amt entfernt, nicht wegen Fehlverhaltens. Die Quelle enthüllte Big League Politics exklusiv, dass Sheriff Israel angeblich auch von der IRS untersucht wird. Die hochrangige Polizeiquelle im Büro des Sheriffs gab bekannt, dass in den letzten Monaten vier Kandidaten interviewt wurden, um die Position des Sheriffs von Broward County neu zu besetzen. Einer der interviewten Kandidaten ist Emery Giany, ein republikanischer Polizeibeamter aus Florida, der eng mit der Generalstaatsanwältin von Florida, Pam Bondi, verbunden ist. Während der Aussage der IG letzte Woche wurde FBI-Direktor Christopher Wray nach der Schießerei in der Parkland-Schule gefragt. Auf Nachfrage lehnte Wray es ab, Fragen zu der Schießerei und Sheriff Israel zu beantworten, und führte an, dass es sich um eine aktive FBI-Untersuchung handele. Nach der Schießerei in Parkland forderte Gouverneur Scott den Rücktritt von Direktor Wray wegen des Versäumnisses des FBI, Nikolas Cruz, 19, den Schulschützen, dessen Pläne, eine Schulschießerei durchzuführen, dem FBI zweimal vor der Schießerei am Valentinstag gemeldet wurden, ordnungsgemäß zu untersuchen. „Wir werben ständig für ‚etwas sehen, etwas sagen‘, und eine mutige Person hat genau das dem FBI angetan. Und das FBI hat nicht gehandelt. „Sehen Sie etwas, sagen Sie etwas“ ist ein unglaublich wichtiges Instrument, und die Menschen müssen Vertrauen in die Umsetzung durch die Strafverfolgungsbehörden haben. Der FBI-Direktor muss zurücktreten“, sagte Gouverneur Scott. Laut der Quelle im Broward Sheriffs Office dreht sich die Entfernung von Sheriff Israel um eine kriminelle Angelegenheit, die dem FBI bekannt ist. Obwohl seine Fehler im Zusammenhang mit der Schießerei in Parkland ursprünglich die Ermittlungen ausgelöst haben, ist dies nicht der einzige Grund, warum er entfernt wird. Die hochrangige Quelle, die anonym bleiben wollte, sagte gegenüber Big League Politics, dass Sheriff Israel bereits bekannt sei, dass er nächste Woche aus dem Amt entfernt werde. Sheriff Israel wurde wegen seines Umgangs mit der Schießerei in der Parkland-Schule, bei der 17 Menschen ums Leben kamen, heftig kritisiert. Nach dem Schulmassaker am Valentinstag an der Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School wurde bekannt, dass Polizisten auf Befehl von Sheriff Israel vor der Schießerei in der Schule 45 Mal zum Haus des Parkland-Schützen gerufen wurden. Es ist unklar, warum die Strafverfolgungsbeamten des Büros des Sheriffs von Broward County und das FBI es versäumt haben, gegen Cruz ordnungsgemäß zu ermitteln, aber ihr massives Versagen wurde direkt dem Verlust von 17 Menschenleben in Parkland, FL, zugeschrieben. Seit der Schießerei in Parkland sind viele wenig schmeichelhafte Informationen über Sheriff Israel ans Licht gekommen. Sheriff Israel und seine Abteilung sind nicht nur ein Sprachrohr für demokratische Politiker und Befürworter der Waffenkontrolle, wie Hillary Clinton und Debbie Wasserman Schultz, mit denen er fotografiert wurde, sondern haben kürzlich wegen weiterer Kontroversen Schlagzeilen gemacht. Im Mai wurde bekannt, dass die Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School und das Büro des Sheriffs von Broward County die Tatsache verschwiegen, dass der Sohn von Sheriff Israel, Brett, angeblich einen 14-jährigen Schüler auf dem Campus in einem Akt des Mobbings angegriffen hatte. Kurz nach der Schießerei in Parkland offenbarte ein von Cruz selbst gefilmtes Handyvideo, dass er sich selbst gemobbt fühlte, was dazu führte, dass er am 14. Februar 2018 bei einem gezielten Angriff auf seine ehemaligen Klassenkameraden ein Massaker verübte. Kürzlich erhielt Sheriff Israel eine massive Gegenreaktion, nachdem das Büro des Sheriffs von Broward County ein Bild eines neuen maßgefertigten Sheriff-Autos von Broward getwittert hatte, auf dem stand: „Unser neuer #dodge #charger. Gefällt dir die Lackierung?“ Der Tweet löste online Empörung bei Republikanern und Demokraten gleichermaßen aus, die witzelten, dass das Büro des Broward Sheriffs die Mittel verwenden sollte, um eine bessere Offiziersausbildung zu bezahlen, nicht neue Autos. Führer auf beiden Seiten des Ganges haben Sheriff Israel aufgefordert, zurückzutreten oder vom Gouverneur wegen seiner extremen Pflichtverletzung und seines Versagens, eine der schlimmsten Schießereien in Schulen in der Geschichte der USA zu verhindern, abgesetzt zu werden. Während der Florida GOP Primary Debatte in Florida letzte Woche wurden der Landwirtschaftskommissar von Florida, Adam Putnam, und der Abgeordnete Ron DeSantis nach der Schießerei in der Parkland-Schule gefragt. Sowohl Putnam als auch DeSantis forderten die Entfernung von Scott Israel, während sie gleichzeitig ihre Unterstützung für den zweiten Verfassungszusatz beteuerten. „Ich hätte diesen Sheriff aus Broward County entfernt. Er hat seine Bürger im Stich gelassen und hätte entfernt werden sollen“, sagte DeSantis. „Sheriff Israel wird untersucht und er muss gehen“, sagte Putnam. Gouverneur Scott wird voraussichtlich in der kommenden Woche eine Erklärung veröffentlichen, wenn Sheriff Israel seines Amtes enthoben wird. Scott kandidiert derzeit für den US-Senat in Florida, und die Nachricht von der Absetzung von Sheriff Israel wird seine Zustimmungsrate bei einer der wichtigsten Senatswahlen des Landes mit Sicherheit steigern. In den Tagen nach der Schießerei in Parkland wurde Sheriff Scott Israel konfrontiert und nach seiner Unterstützung und Zugehörigkeit zur Demokratischen Partei gefragt und warum er sich entschied, Waffen dafür verantwortlich zu machen, anstatt seine Abteilung und das FBI zur Rechenschaft zu ziehen. Sheriff Israel konnte harten Befragungen nicht standhalten, wurde nervös und beendete das Interview, nachdem er gesagt hatte: „Die einzige Person, die für diesen Mord verantwortlich ist, ist der abscheuliche, feige Mörder. Er ist allein verantwortlich für diese schreckliche Tat.“ Wie die Untersuchung von Parkland jedoch gezeigt hat, ließen sowohl Sheriff Israel als auch das FBI den Ball fallen und sind schuld daran, dass sie die Schießerei trotz mehrfacher Warnsignale nicht verhindert haben.

b9ccbcb4	Obwohl Gesundheitsbehörden die Amerikaner gewarnt haben, sich auf die Ausbreitung des neuartigen Coronavirus in den USA vorzubereiten, sollten die Menschen laut den Centers for Disease Control and Prevention des US-Gesundheitsministeriums keine Gesichtsmasken tragen, um die Ausbreitung der Infektionskrankheit zu verhindern and Human Services und der US-Chirurg General. Aber das ist nicht der einzige Grund, warum Amerikaner vielleicht zweimal über die Verwendung von Masken nachdenken sollten, sagte ein Experte gegenüber MarketWatch. Die meisten Menschen wissen nicht, wie man Gesichtsmasken richtig verwendet, und ein Ansturm auf den Kauf von Masken könnte verhindern, dass die Menschen, die sie am dringendsten brauchen – Gesundheitsdienstleister – sie bekommen, sagte Dr. Amesh Adalja, ein Gelehrter am Zentrum für Gesundheitssicherheit an der Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Tatsächlich forderte der US-Chirurgengeneral kürzlich die Öffentlichkeit auf, „HÖREN SIE AUF, MASKEN ZU KAUFEN!“ „Sie sind NICHT wirksam, um zu verhindern, dass sich die breite Öffentlichkeit mit dem #Coronavirus ansteckt, aber wenn Gesundheitsdienstleister sie nicht dazu bringen können, sich um kranke Patienten zu kümmern, gefährdet dies sie und unsere Gemeinden!“, schrieb Surgeon General Jerome Adams auf Twitter US:TWTR Die CDC sagte letzten Monat, sie empfehle den Menschen nicht, Gesichtsmasken zu verwenden, und gab am selben Tag bekannt, dass der erste Fall einer Übertragung von Coronavirus von Person zu Person in den USA gemeldet wurde. Die CDC-Empfehlung zu Masken steht, sagte ein Sprecher gegenüber MarketWatch Mittwoch, sogar mit dem ersten gemeldeten Fall einer COVID-19-Infektion bei einer Person in Kalifornien, die nicht in China war oder einer Person ausgesetzt war, bei der das Virus diagnostiziert wurde. „Das Virus breitet sich nicht in der Allgemeinheit aus“, sagte Dr. Nancy Messonnier, Direktorin des Zentrums für das Nationale Zentrum für Immunisierung und Atemwegserkrankungen, in einem Briefing am 30. Januar. „Wir empfehlen der Öffentlichkeit nicht routinemäßig die Verwendung von Gesichtsmasken, um Atemwegserkrankungen vorzubeugen. Und das empfehlen wir derzeit sicherlich nicht für dieses neue Virus.“ HHS-Sekretär Alex Azar sagte am Dienstag: „Unser Rat bleibt unverändert, dass der durchschnittliche Amerikaner keine N95-Maske benötigt. Diese sind wirklich mehr für Gesundheitsdienstleister.“ N95-Masken sitzen enger als chirurgische Masken und schützen laut CDC vor kleinen Partikeln und großen Tröpfchen. Azar sagte, dass sich nur 30 Millionen N95-Masken im nationalen Vorrat befinden, und fügte hinzu, dass „in den USA bis zu 300 Millionen Masken für Beschäftigte im Gesundheitswesen benötigt werden“. Am Montag gab es in den USA 86 Fälle von COVID-19 und zwei gemeldete Todesfälle. Siehe auch: Die Lagerbestände von Alpha Pro Tech schießen in die Höhe, da der Ausbruch des Coronavirus zu einem großen Anstieg der Bestellungen von Gesichtsmasken führt Desinfektionsmittel im ganzen Land, sagte Alexandra Brown, eine Sprecherin von Walgreens, dem beide Ketten gehören. „Wir überwachen diese Art von Situationen kontinuierlich und genau, um sicherzustellen, dass wir eine ausreichende Versorgung mit diesen Produkten haben“, sagte sie. Mehrere Websites haben Gesichtsmasken vollständig ausverkauft. Die Gesichtsmasken der US:TGT-Marke von Target, deren Preis bei 5,99 $ für eine 10er-Packung lag, waren am Donnerstag auf seiner Website nicht vorrätig. Eine Target-Sprecherin lehnte es ab, sich dazu zu äußern, wann die Gesichtsmasken wieder auf Lager sein würden. Letzten Donnerstag waren noch einige Gesichtsmasken bei Amazon US:AMZN erhältlich, obwohl viele schnell ausverkauft waren. Eine Packung mit 20 3M US:MMM-Gesichtsmasken war am Donnerstagmorgen für 129 US-Dollar erhältlich, aber bis zum Mittag war sie ausverkauft. Im April letzten Jahres kostete die gleiche Packung Masken laut camelcamelcamel.com, einer Website, die historische Preise von bei Amazon verkauften Waren verfolgt, 9,99 US-Dollar. Amazon und 3M antworteten nicht auf Anfragen nach Kommentaren, wann Kunden damit rechnen können, Masken zu kaufen, die derzeit nicht vorrätig sind. Um sich vor einem Mangel an Masken zu schützen, hat Home Depot US:HD US:HD US:HD US:HD US:HD „eine begrenzte Abnahmemenge von 10 [Masken] pro Person, um so viele Kunden wie möglich optimal bedienen zu können“, sagte Margaret Smith. eine Home Depot-Sprecherin. „Unsere Merchandising- und Lieferkettenteams arbeiten hart daran, diese Artikel so schnell wie möglich wieder aufzufüllen.“ CVS US:CVS verzeichnete auch einen Anstieg der Verkäufe von Gesichtsmasken. Die Nachfrage „kann an einigen Standorten zu Engpässen führen, und wir werden diese Geschäfte so schnell wie möglich wieder beliefern“, sagte Stephanie Cunha, eine Sprecherin von CVS, letzten Monat. Adalja begrüßte die Empfehlung der CDC zu Gesichtsmasken. „Selbst während H1N1 [Grippeepidemie] gab es keine Empfehlung, Gesichtsmasken zu tragen“, sagte er. Sie „schaffen am Ende ein falsches Sicherheitsgefühl und die meisten Menschen tragen sie nicht angemessen“, sagte er. Menschen, die nicht im medizinischen Bereich tätig sind und die Masken tragen, kommen oft mit Keimen in Kontakt, wenn sie die Maske zum Essen hochheben oder ihre Finger unter die Maske schieben, um sich die Nase zu putzen, sagte er. Die von Panik getriebene Nachfrage nach Gesichtsmasken, sagte Adalja, sei besonders besorgniserregend, da sie einen „negativen Angebotsschock“ für das Krankenhauspersonal haben könnte, das diese Masken mehr als die breite Öffentlichkeit benötigt. Wie der Generalchirurg sagte Adalja: „Die besten Möglichkeiten [für die breite Öffentlichkeit], sich selbst zu schützen, sind die grundlegenden Hygienemaßnahmen.“ Dazu gehören regelmäßiges Händewaschen und das Abdecken von Niesen und Husten. Aber wenn Sie „krank sind und raus müssen, sollten Sie eine Maske tragen“. Anstatt Gesichtsmasken zu tragen, sollte die breite Öffentlichkeit „auf die Symptome und Anzeichen dieses neuartigen Coronavirus achten, d. h. Fieber und Husten, und wenn Sie diese Symptome haben, rufen Sie bitte Ihren Arzt an“, sagte Messonnier zuletzt Monat. „Wir möchten, dass unsere Maßnahmen evidenzbasiert und den aktuellen Umständen angemessen sind“, sagte sie, was ihrer Meinung nach die Verwendung von Gesichtsmasken für Personen, die dem Virus nicht direkt ausgesetzt waren, nicht rechtfertige. Die CDC hat gesagt, sie erwartet mehr Coronavirus-Fälle in den USA. „Es ist nicht so sehr eine Frage, ob …, sondern eher eine Frage, wann genau dies passieren wird und wie viele Menschen in diesem Land schwer krank sein werden“, sagte Messonnier weiter 25. Februar. Es gibt noch viele Unbekannte darüber, wie sich dieser Stamm des Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, ausbreitet, aber wenn es in der Vergangenheit zu einer Übertragung von Mensch zu Mensch gekommen ist, „geht man davon aus, dass dies über Atemtröpfchen erfolgt ist, die bei einer Infektion produziert wurden Person hustet oder niest, ähnlich wie sich Influenza und andere Atemwegserreger ausbreiten“, sagte die CDC auf ihrer Website. Wie die CDC rät die Weltgesundheitsorganisation den Menschen, nur dann eine Maske zu tragen, wenn sie Symptome des Coronavirus zeigen oder „sich um eine Person mit Verdacht auf eine 2019-nCoV-Infektion kümmern“. In einem separaten Update im letzten Monat gab die WHO Anweisungen zum angemessenen Tragen und Entsorgen von Gesichtsmasken. Die WHO stellte außerdem fest: „Die Verwendung einer Maske allein reicht jedoch nicht aus, um ein angemessenes Schutzniveau zu gewährleisten, und es sollten andere ebenso relevante Maßnahmen ergriffen werden.“ Die WHO rät Menschen, die eine Maske tragen möchten, die Maske „sorgfältig zu platzieren, um Mund und Nase zu bedecken und sicher zu binden, um Lücken zwischen Gesicht und Maske zu minimieren“, die Maske nicht zu berühren, während Sie sie tragen, und die Masken zu entsorgen sobald sie feucht oder feucht werden. Beim Abnehmen der Gesichtsmaske empfiehlt die WHO, dass die Menschen „die Vorderseite nicht berühren, sondern die Spitze von hinten entfernen“. Weltweit haben sich 89.197 Menschen mit COVID-19 infiziert, und bis Montag sind mindestens 3.048 gestorben. Diese Geschichte wurde ursprünglich am 30. Januar veröffentlicht und wurde aktualisiert.

054fefab	11. Januar 2017 WASHINGTON – US-Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.) forderte heute die Demokraten im Senat auf, mit den Republikanern zusammenzuarbeiten, um Obamacare aufzuheben und den Weg für Lösungen zu ebnen, die den Zugang zu hochwertiger und erschwinglicher Gesundheitsversorgung für alle Amerikaner erweitern. Eine Abstimmung über ein Gesetz, das dem Kongress die Instrumente zur Aufhebung von Obamacare an die Hand gibt, wird im Laufe des heutigen Tages im Senat erwartet. „Die Demokraten haben es versäumt, fast jedes Versprechen zu erfüllen, das sie gemacht haben, als sie Obamacare ohne eine einzige republikanische Stimme durch den Kongress zwangen“, sagte Blunt. „Trotz all ihrer gegenteiligen Behauptungen hat dieses Gesetz Millionen von Amerikanern von den Plänen und Ärzten gedrängt, die sie mochten und sich leisten konnten, Prämien und Selbstbehalte drastisch in die Höhe getrieben und die Anzahl der für Familien verfügbaren Krankenversicherungsoptionen reduziert.“ In diesem Jahr haben 97 Bezirke in Missouri nur einen Versicherer, der an den Obamacare-Börsen teilnimmt. Letztes Jahr hatte jeder Landkreis in Missouri mindestens zwei Versicherungsoptionen. Darüber hinaus werden die meisten Missourianer eine Erhöhung ihrer Prämien sehen, wobei einige mit einer Erhöhung um 40 Prozent konfrontiert sind. Blunt fuhr fort: „Jetzt ist die Zeit für die Senatsdemokraten gekommen, die Dinge richtig zu machen. Sie werden diese Gelegenheit heute haben, wenn der Senat eine Resolution erwägt, die dem Kongress die Werkzeuge gibt, um Obamacare aufzuheben und den Weg für Lösungen zu ebnen, die den Zugang zu hochwertiger und erschwinglicher Gesundheitsversorgung erweitern. Mit diesem ersten Schritt zur Aufhebung von Obamacare halten die Republikaner die Versprechen, die wir dem amerikanischen Volk gemacht haben. Ich fordere alle meine demokratischen Kollegen auf, dasselbe zu tun.“	SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Nr. 18A335 RICHARD BRAKEBILL, ET AL. v.

ab66dbab	"Speck, Burger und Würstchen sind eine ebenso große Krebsgefahr wie Zigaretten, müssen die globalen Gesundheitschefs regieren. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation soll verarbeitetes Fleisch neben Arsen und Asbest zu den krebserregendsten Stoffen zählen. Frisches rotes Fleisch soll ebenfalls in die „Enzyklopädie der Karzinogene“ aufgenommen werden und dürfte nur geringfügig weniger gefährlich eingestuft werden als die konservierten Produkte. Für das Video nach unten scrollen Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation listet verarbeitetes Fleisch neben Arsen und Asbest unter den krebserregendsten Substanzen auf Lebensmittelbereich. Sie könnten auch zu neuen Ernährungsrichtlinien und Warnhinweisen auf Speckpackungen führen. Die Einstufungen der Internationalen Agentur für Krebsforschung der WHO kommen angesichts der wachsenden Besorgnis, dass Fleisch die Krankheit anheizt, die im Vereinigten Königreich jährlich mehr als 150.000 Todesopfer fordert. Die Verbindungen zu Darmkrebs, Großbritanniens zweitgrößter Krebstodesursache, sind besonders stark, wobei Schätzungen zufolge die Hälfte der Fälle durch eine gesündere Lebensweise verhindert werden könnten. Die wissenschaftlichen Berater des Gesundheitsministeriums kamen kürzlich zu dem Schluss, dass rotes und verarbeitetes Fleisch „wahrscheinlich“ die Wahrscheinlichkeit von Darmkrebs erhöht. Es wird jedoch erwartet, dass die WHO noch weiter geht und sagt, dass verarbeitetes Fleisch Krebs verursacht. Die am Montag fällige Entscheidung folgt einem Treffen von Wissenschaftlern aus zehn Nationen, darunter Großbritannien, die alle verfügbaren Beweise geprüft haben. Rauchen: Es wird angenommen, dass Wissenschaftler zugestimmt haben, dass verarbeitetes Fleisch „für Menschen krebserregend“ ist, die höchste von fünf möglichen Einstufungen, die mit Alkohol, Asbest, Arsen und Zigaretten geteilt werden von fünf möglichen Rankings, geteilt mit Alkohol, Asbest, Arsen und Zigaretten. Risiken und Nutzen müssen zusammen betrachtet werden, bevor man den Menschen sagt, was sie essen, trinken, fahren, atmen oder wo sie arbeiten sollen. Barry Carpenter, Präsident des North American Meat Institute Verarbeitetes Fleisch wird durch Räuchern, Pökeln, Salzen oder Hinzufügen von Chemikalien hergestellt. Beispiele sind Schinken, Speck, Pastrami und Salami sowie Hot Dogs und einige Würstchen. Burger sollen auch dabei sein. Es wird erwartet, dass rotes Fleisch eine Stufe darunter liegt, „wahrscheinlich krebserregend für den Menschen“. Fleisch enthält im Allgemeinen hohe Fettkonzentrationen, und es wird angenommen, dass die Verbindung, die dem Fleisch seine rote Farbe verleiht, die Darmschleimhaut schädigen kann. Verarbeitetes Fleisch wurde zuvor für einen von 30 Todesfällen verantwortlich gemacht und wird als gefährlich angesehen, da Konservierungstechniken den Gehalt an krebserregenden Chemikalien erhöhen können. Schätzungen zufolge würden in Großbritannien jedes Jahr fast 20.000 vorzeitige Todesfälle verhindert, wenn die Aufnahme auf 20 g pro Tag reduziert würde – eine Scheibe Speck pro Tag oder ein englisches Frühstück einmal pro Woche. Urteil: Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation soll verarbeitetes Fleisch neben Arsen und Asbest als eine der krebserregendsten Substanzen aufführen Jeder Ratschlag, verarbeitetes Fleisch zu reduzieren oder zu vermeiden, wird von Krebsorganisationen begrüßt. Aber es könnte enorme Auswirkungen auf die Fleischindustrie haben, die bedenken wird, dass die Zuckerverkäufe im vergangenen Jahr zurückgegangen sind, nachdem die WHO eine Warnung vor übermäßigem Konsum herausgegeben hatte. Der Rindfleischsektor erwirtschaftet 2,8 Milliarden Pfund für die Wirtschaft und bietet 440.000 Arbeitsplätze in England. Das nordamerikanische Fleischinstitut NAMI sagte, der Bericht widerspreche „sowohl dem gesunden Menschenverstand als auch Dutzenden von Studien, die keine Korrelation zwischen Fleisch und Krebs zeigen“. „Rotes und verarbeitetes Fleisch gehört zu den 940 Substanzen, die von der Internationalen Forschungsagentur IARC auf ein gewisses Maß an theoretischer „Gefahr“ geprüft wurden“, sagte Barry Carpenter, Präsident von NAMI. „IARC sagt, dass Sie Ihren Yoga-Kurs genießen können, aber nicht krebserregende Luft der Klasse I einatmen, in der Nähe eines sonnendurchfluteten Fensters der Klasse I sitzen, Wein oder Kaffee der Klasse I und Klasse 2A trinken, gegrilltes Essen der Klasse 2A essen oder Aloe anwenden vera Klasse 2B. ""Risiken und Vorteile müssen zusammen betrachtet werden, bevor man den Menschen sagt, was sie essen, trinken, fahren, atmen oder wo sie arbeiten sollen."" Die Industrie sagt, rotes Fleisch sei reich an Proteinen, eine gute Quelle für Vitamine, Eisen und Zink und ein wichtiger Bestandteil einer ausgewogenen Ernährung. Professor Richard Knox, ein ehemaliger Experte des Instituts für Krebsforschung, sagte, „die meisten Todesfälle durch Krebs werden nicht auf Darmkrebs zurückzuführen sein und noch weniger auf den Verzehr von Fleisch zurückzuführen sein“. Regierungsrichtlinien zu rotem Fleisch aus dem Jahr 2011 empfehlen, dass Erwachsene nicht mehr als 70 g pro Tag essen."

842ac903	"Der Abgeordnete Leon Young stellt fest, dass die Wisconsin Legislative bereits nur in Teilzeit arbeitet. Also sollte es vielleicht so bezahlt werden. Anfang dieser Woche brachte Young, D-Milwaukee, die Idee einer Verfassungsänderung auf den Weg, die den Gesetzgeber aufforderte, sich nur in den ersten drei Monaten des Jahres zu treffen und sein Gehalt um 75 Prozent zu kürzen – von derzeit 49.943 US-Dollar auf 12.000 US-Dollar pro Jahr. „Nachdem ich die Anzahl der Sitzungstage im Laufe des Bienniums 2011-12 überprüft hatte, stellte ich fest, dass wir uns insgesamt nur an 34 Tagen von möglichen 122 Sitzungstagen trafen“, sagte Young. „Es ist fair zu sagen, dass wir jetzt tatsächlich als ‚de facto‘ Teilzeitgesetzgeber fungieren.“ Wenn Sie sich nur die Anzahl der Sitzungstage im Jahr 2012 ansehen, sagte Young, sinkt die Zahl auf sieben. ""Wer arbeitet sieben Tage und wird ein ganzes Jahr bezahlt?"" er hat gefragt. Laut der National Conference of State Legislatures gehört Wisconsin zu den 10 Staaten, in denen die Gehälter am höchsten sind, es viele Mitarbeiter gibt und „die Gesetzgeber genug bezahlt werden, um ihren Lebensunterhalt zu bestreiten, ohne externes Einkommen zu benötigen“. Ein ähnlicher Vorschlag zur Kürzung der Gehälter und des Budgets des Milwaukee County Board wurde eingebracht und findet Unterstützung bei einigen Republikanern, die beide Kammern der Legislative kontrollieren. Diese Maßnahme, die von der staatlichen Senatorin Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, und dem Abgeordneten Joe Sanfelippo, R-West Allis, auf den Weg gebracht wurde, würde es den Wählern ermöglichen, zu entscheiden, ob sie die Gehälter der Vorgesetzten von derzeit 51.000 USD auf 15.000 USD pro Jahr kürzen und die Gesundheit beseitigen sollen und Pensionsleistungen und nehmen tiefe Kürzungen im Jahresbudget des Vorstands von 6,5 Millionen US-Dollar vor. Es wird interessant sein zu sehen, ob der Gesetzgeber eine Teilzeit-Legislative mit dem gleichen Enthusiasmus betrachtet wie einen Teilzeit-Verwaltungsrat von Milwaukee County. Young sagte, er habe in den letzten Tagen „ein paar Anrufe“ von anderen Gesetzgebern erhalten, „einige zur Unterstützung, andere eigentlich nicht allzu glücklich“. Harte Zeiten für die Demokratiekampagne Die Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, eine der stärksten Stimmen des Bundesstaates für Regierungstransparenz, hat eine schwere Zeit durchgemacht. Über die Feiertage wurde der in Madison ansässigen Gruppe mitgeteilt, dass sie bald die Finanzierung durch die Joyce Foundation verlieren würde, die die gemeinnützige Organisation 16 Jahre lang unterstützt hatte. Exekutivdirektor Mike McCabe sagte, er arbeite daran, neue Einnahmequellen zu generieren, um die 232.000 Dollar an verlorener Joyce-Finanzierung zu ersetzen. Das Jahresbudget der Democracy Campaign beträgt 430.000 US-Dollar pro Jahr. McCabe sagte, seine höchste Priorität sei die Pflege der durchsuchbaren Datenbank der Gruppe, die Spenden an staatliche Kandidaten und die damit verbundene Forschung verfolgt – was ungefähr 130.000 US-Dollar pro Jahr kostet. „Wir wollen zumindest unser Tracking-Programm und unsere durchsuchbare Datenbank beibehalten und die Kapazitäten für Recherchen und Analysen beibehalten, um die Punkte zwischen all dem (Kampagnen-)Geld und den Stimmen im Capitol zu verbinden“, sagte McCabe. Einige spekulieren, dass McCabes oft scharfe Kritik an Beamten der Demokratiekampagne mehr Feinde als Freunde eingebracht hat. „Ich entschuldige mich nicht dafür, dass ich mich für ein System einsetze, das Menschen über Geld stellt“, sagte er. ""Ich bin verpflichtet und entschlossen, dies am Laufen zu halten."" Wenn er scheitert, sagte McCabe: ""Es wird wahrscheinlich einige Capitol-Insider geben, die sehr glücklich wären."""	in	false

cd9cd5e8	MOSKAU – Der russische Präsident Wladimir Putin beaufsichtigte am Mittwoch einen Test eines neuen Hyperschall-Gleitfahrzeugs und erklärte, dass die Waffe unmöglich abzufangen sei und die Sicherheit Russlands für die kommenden Jahrzehnte gewährleisten werde. Im Gespräch mit Russlands hochrangigem Militär, nachdem er den Live-Feed des Starts des Avangard-Fahrzeugs aus dem Kontrollraum des Verteidigungsministeriums gesehen hatte, sagte Putin, der erfolgreiche Test sei ein „großer Erfolg“ und ein „hervorragendes Neujahrsgeschenk an die Nation“. Der Test findet inmitten erbitterter Spannungen zwischen Russland und den USA statt. Beziehungen, die durch den Konflikt in der Ukraine, den Krieg in Syrien und die Vorwürfe der russischen Einmischung in die US-Präsidentschaftswahlen 2016 auf den niedrigsten Stand seit Zeiten des Kalten Krieges gesunken sind. Putins Hoffnungen auf eine Wiederherstellung der Beziehungen zu Washington unter Präsident Donald Trump sind angesichts der Ermittlungen zu Vorwürfen von Trumps Wahlkampfbeziehungen zu Russland im Sande verlaufen, und die Spannungen eskalierten, als die US-Regierung Russland mit neuen Wellen von Sanktionen schlug. Die Avangard gehörte zu der Reihe neuer Atomwaffen, die Putin im März präsentierte, und sagte, Russland müsse sie als Reaktion auf die Entwicklung des US-Raketenabwehrsystems entwickeln, das Russlands nukleare Abschreckung untergraben könnte. Von links beaufsichtigen Sergej Iwanow, russischer Sonderbeauftragter für Umwelt- und Verkehrsfragen, der russische Verteidigungsminister Sergej Schoigu, der russische Präsident Wladimir Putin und der russische Generalstabschef Waleri Gerasimow den Teststart des Hyperschall-Gleitfahrzeugs Avangard Kontrollraum des Verteidigungsministeriums in Moskau, Russland, Mittwoch, 26.

Der Kreml sagte, er habe erfolgreich ein ausgewiesenes Übungsziel auf dem Kura-Schießstand auf Kamtschatka, 6.000 Kilometer entfernt, getroffen. × Angst, etwas zu verpassen?

Die Avangard sei unverwundbar, um durch bestehende und potenzielle Raketenabwehrmittel des potenziellen Gegners abzufangen, sagte Putin nach dem Test und fügte hinzu, dass die neue Waffe nächstes Jahr bei den Strategic Missile Forces des Militärs in Dienst gestellt werde. Bei der ersten Präsentation des Avangard im März sagte der russische Führer, das neue System habe eine interkontinentale Reichweite und könne mit 20-facher Schallgeschwindigkeit in der Atmosphäre fliegen, wobei es die Raketenabwehr des Feindes umgeht. Er betonte, dass derzeit kein anderes Land über Hyperschallwaffen verfüge. Putin sagte, dass Avangard unter Verwendung neuer Verbundmaterialien entwickelt wurde, um Temperaturen von bis zu 2.000 Grad Celsius 3.632 Grad Fahrenheit standzuhalten, die bei einem Flug durch die Atmosphäre mit Überschallgeschwindigkeit entstehen.

Eine Untersuchung hat gezeigt, dass von 77.440 laufenden Asylfällen jeder sechste sein erstes Treffen mit dem Grenzchef übersprang und verschwand. Zu den 11.988 gehören Migranten, die beschlagnahmt und festgehalten wurden, als sie versuchten, sich in das Vereinigte Königreich einzuschleichen, die aber später den Behörden entwischt sind. Wir müssen wissen, ob die Regierung sie aus den Augen verloren hat. Wir müssen sicher sein, dass wir keine Situation haben, in der schutzbedürftige Menschen in die Schattenwirtschaft gezogen und Opfer der Sklaverei werden. Es wird angenommen, dass viele der Abgefangenen bereits hier freigelassen wurden, um sich illegalen Einwanderern anzuschließen. Die alarmierende Statistik des Innenministeriums, die dem Daily Express unter den Gesetzen zur Informationsfreiheit veröffentlicht wurde, könnte sogar die Spitze des Eisbergs sein. Es gab gestern Abend Ärger über die Nachlässigkeit von Charlie Elphicke, dem Tory-Abgeordneten für Dover, der sagte: „Es ist sehr besorgniserregend, dass etwa 12.000 Asylbewerber nicht zu einem Interview erschienen sind. „Wir müssen wissen, ob die Regierung sie aus den Augen verloren hat. Wir müssen sicher sein, dass wir keine Situation haben, in der schutzbedürftige Menschen in die Schattenwirtschaft gezogen und Opfer der Sklaverei werden. „Deshalb ist es so wichtig, dass diese Menschen gefunden werden.“ Die boomende Schattenwirtschaft Großbritanniens wird auf 150 Milliarden Pfund geschätzt und unterstützt mindestens 1,1 Millionen Menschen, die sich illegal hier aufhalten könnten. Die Zahl derer, die vor den Augen von Einwanderungsbeamten verschwunden sind, tauchte auf, nachdem der Daily Express nach dem Verbleib von fünf Iranern fragte, die in einem Schlauchboot hierher gesegelt waren. Migranten unternehmen extreme Anstrengungen, um Grenzen zu überqueren Fri, October 7, 2016 Verzweifelte Migranten, die aus Syrien und den umliegenden Orten fliehen, haben auf unglaubliche Weise versucht, sich über die Grenzen zu schleichen. Dazu gehören das Verstecken in Koffern und das Schlafen neben Motorhauben.

Fast zwei Monate später konnte niemand offiziell bestätigen, wo sie sich befinden. Grenzbeamte ließen die Männer zwischen 18 und 44 Jahren frei, befahlen ihnen jedoch, sich regelmäßig zu melden. Alp Mehmet von MigrationWatch UK sagte: „Während die illegale Einwanderung weiterhin ein großes Problem darstellt, sind die Ressourcen, die für ihre Bewältigung aufgewendet werden, nach wie vor unzureichend. „Die Zahl der Zwangsabschiebungen hat sich seit 15 Jahren kaum verändert. GETTY Einer von sechs Personen hat sein erstes Treffen mit Grenzchefs geschwänzt und ist verschwunden, laut Zahlen. Die Grenzschutz- und Durchsetzungsteams müssen über das Budget, die Unterstützung und die politische Unterstützung verfügen, um mit der illegalen Einwanderung fertig zu werden.“ Die Asylanträge stiegen im vergangenen Jahr um 38 Prozent auf 34.687. Die meisten kamen aus dem Iran, Eritrea, dem Irak, dem Sudan, Pakistan und Syrien. Einschließlich der Angehörigen lag die Zahl bei 41.563. Asyl kostete das Vereinigte Königreich im vergangenen Jahr 546 Millionen Pfund. Der Sprecher der Ukip-Verteidigung, MdEP Mike Hookem, sagte: „Das Innenministerium hält es für wahrscheinlich, dass Menschen, die illegal hier landen, frei gehen und ein anderes Mal zu einem Termin zurückkehren dürfen. Es ist lächerlich naiv oder demonstriert einen Mangel an Finanzierung und Investitionen. SWNS Charlie Elphicke sagte, Migranten müssten gefunden werden, damit sie nicht auf dem Schwarzmarkt landen. Wir haben eine Abteilung, die für diesen Zweck nicht geeignet ist.“ In einem Bericht vom vergangenen Dezember sagte David Bolt, unabhängiger Hauptinspektor für Grenzen und Einwanderung: „Asylfallmanager sagten uns, dass es 10.000 Asylanträge gab, bei denen die Antragsteller keinen Kontakt hatten oder geflüchtet waren. „Während die Teams Hausbesuche durchführen konnten, um Flüchtige aufzuspüren, zögerten sie, da dies keine Priorität hatte und als Ressourcenbelastung angesehen wurde.“ GETTY Asylanträge stiegen im vergangenen Jahr um 38 Prozent auf 34.687	Wenn Kohlendioxid so schlecht für den Planeten ist, warum kaufen Gewächshausbauern dann CO2-Generatoren, um das Pflanzenwachstum zu verdoppeln?	false

a655530c	"DATUM: 1. November 2015 AN: USF- und NRA-Mitglieder und Freunde VON: Marion P. Hammer USF-Exekutivdirektorin NRA Past President Viele Leute erinnern sich, dass die Florida Sheriffs Association während des Kampfes um die Verabschiedung des Gesetzes zum verdeckten Tragen in Florida gegen das verdeckte Tragen war. Sie sagten buchstäblich, dass sie „versteckte Waffen“ nicht mochten. Zu dieser Zeit war offenes Tragen in Florida legal und das schon seit Jahrzehnten. Sie sagten, wenn Menschen Waffen tragen dürften, müssten sie diese offen tragen, damit die Strafverfolgungsbeamten sie sehen und wissen könnten, wer Waffen habe – sie behaupteten, es sei eine Frage der Sicherheit der Beamten. Jetzt haben sie ihre Positionen umgekehrt. Sie behaupten, verdecktes Tragen sei in Ordnung, und sie hätten nichts gegen verdeckte Waffen. ABER offenes Tragen ist gefährlich. Sie behaupten, sie würden die Guten nicht von den Bösen unterscheiden, und ein Sheriff (jetzt im Ruhestand) sagte, die Strafverfolgung müsste „herunterziehen“ und jeden, der offen trägt. Sie haben wahrscheinlich den größten Teil der Rhetorik gehört oder gelesen. Sie beginnen immer damit, zu sagen, dass sie starke Befürworter des zweiten Verfassungszusatzes sind, und erklären dann, warum sie sich gegen die Rechte des zweiten Verfassungszusatzes stellen. Die Verfassung garantiert Ihnen das Recht, Waffen zu besitzen und zu tragen, und bestimmt nicht, dass Sie Ihre Rechte nur dann ausüben können, wenn Ihr Sheriff damit einverstanden ist. Unten sind die Fakten über Open Carry – es ist eine Widerlegung einiger der neuesten Behauptungen. Sie können auch hier klicken Die Wahrheit über Open Carry, um eine Kopie des Informationsblatts herunterzuladen und mit anderen zu teilen. Die Wahrheit über das Open-Carry-Gesetz und die 45 Staaten, die Open-Carry zulassen In kürzlich erschienenen Blog-Artikeln der Palm Beach Post und einem Blog-Artikel der Tampa Bay Times wird der Vorsitzende des Legislativausschusses (FSA) der Florida Sheriffs Association mit einigen falschen Behauptungen bezüglich der vorgeschlagene Open-Carry-Rechnung in Florida (SB-300 von Senator Don Gaetz und HB-163 von Rep. Matt Gaetz). In kürzlich erschienenen Blog-Artikeln der Palm Beach Post und einem Blog-Artikel der Tampa Bay Times wird der Vorsitzende des Legislative Committee (FSA) der Florida Sheriffs Association mit einigen falschen Behauptungen bezüglich des vorgeschlagenen Open-Carry-Gesetzes in Florida (SB-300 von Senator Don Gaetz) zitiert und HB-163 von Rep. Matt Gaetz). Nachfolgend finden Sie einige dieser Behauptungen und unsere Antworten. FSA-BEHAUPTUNG: „Der Gesetzentwurf, wie er derzeit entworfen wird, ist extrem weit gefasst, es fehlen Grenzen dafür, wann, wie oder wo Schusswaffen getragen werden könnten.“ FAKT: Die gleichen Bestimmungen und Einschränkungen, die für das verdeckte Tragen gelten, gelten auch für das offene Tragen (s.790.06). Nur eine Person mit einer Lizenz zum verdeckten Tragen kann offen tragen. Darüber hinaus gilt das Gesetz über die unzulässige Ausstellung von Schusswaffen (s.790.10), unabhängig davon, ob das Tragen verdeckt oder offen erfolgt. Wegen dieser und anderer falscher Behauptungen wurde am Morgen des 20.10.15 im Strafjustizausschuss des Senats eine Klarstellungsänderung hinzugefügt, um Gegner von Open Carry davon abzuhalten, weiterhin solche falschen Behauptungen aufzustellen – wir kennen den Sprecher machte diese Behauptung sogar NACHDEM der präzisierende Änderungsantrag hinzugefügt wurde, weil der Sprecher auf einen Änderungsantrag verwies, der in derselben Ausschusssitzung „nicht angenommen“ wurde. Da der FSA-Sprecher den Daten der NRA offensichtlich keinen Glauben schenken will, wurden die folgenden Daten von Florida Carry, Inc. zur Verfügung gestellt – und deren Daten bestätigen unsere. FSA-BEHAUPTUNG: „Die Befürworter des Gesetzentwurfs behaupten, dass 45 andere Staaten Open-Carry bereits erlauben. Aber das ist nicht wirklich zutreffend.“ FAKT: Im Gegenteil, es ist richtig. Fünfundvierzig (45) Staaten erlauben das offene Tragen von Schusswaffen. Unterschiedliche Beschränkungen für Open Carry in einigen Staaten ändern nichts an der Tatsache, dass 45 Staaten Open Carry erlauben. 15 von 45 offenen Tragestaaten erfordern eine Lizenz zum verdeckten oder offenen Tragen. 30 von 45 Open-Carry-Staaten benötigen keine Lizenz zum offenen Tragen. 0 von 15 der verdeckten Carry-Lizenzstaaten erfordern eine zusätzliche Schulung zum offenen Tragen. 0 von 45 Staaten bieten eine separate ""Open Carry""-Lizenz an . Am 1.1.16 verlangt Texas ein Holster. 0 von 45 Staaten erfordern ein Retentionsholster. 5 von 15 sind ""kann ausstellende"" Staaten, in denen die Strafverfolgungsbehörden Lizenzen ausstellen. 15 von 15 Staaten verlangen vom Lizenzinhaber, dass er die Lizenz auf rechtmäßiges Verlangen eines Strafverfolgungsbeamten vorlegt. FSA-BEHAUPTUNG: ""... die meisten Open-Carry-Staaten haben strenge Regeln für ... die Ausstellung der Genehmigung auf Anfrage."" FAKT: Dies ist ein Ablenkungsmanöver. Das Gesetz von FLORIDA schreibt Lizenzinhabern bereits vor, auf Verlangen eines Strafverfolgungsbeamten eine Lizenz vorzulegen. Und fürs Protokoll, alle 15 Staaten, die eine Lizenz verlangen, verlangen die Vorlage der Lizenz auf rechtmäßige Anfrage durch einen Strafverfolgungsbeamten. FSA-BEHAUPTUNG: „…[I]es ist ‚intellektuell unehrlich‘ zu sagen, dass Open-Carry-Gesetze in den 45 anderen Bundesstaaten funktionieren, weil es so viele Unterschiede in den Gesetzen und der Demografie gibt. FAKT: Die Open-Carry-Gesetze funktionieren in 45 Die Gegner haben keine gegenteiligen Beweise vorgelegt – keine Beweise dafür, dass es in keinem Staat funktioniert und keine Beweise für Probleme in irgendeinem Staat. Dies sind nur unbegründete Behauptungen. Einfach weil verschiedene Staaten Unterschiede in ihren Gesetzen haben, nicht in jedem Art und Weise ändern die Tatsache, dass Open Carry erlaubt ist und dass es funktioniert. FSA CLAIM: „In Pennsylvania zum Beispiel können Städte ihr Open Carry-Gesetz ablehnen, und einige, einschließlich Philadelphia, tun genau das, sagte Gualtieri. Städte in Florida haben nicht die Möglichkeit, sich von einem staatlichen Gesetz abzumelden.“ FAKT: Pennsylvania erlaubt es Städten NICHT, sich von seinem Open-Carry-Gesetz abzumelden. Pennsylvania erfordert keine Lizenz für eine Person, um offen zu tragen. Philadelphia kann sich nicht entscheiden out“ des staatlichen Open-Carry-Gesetzes. Das Gesetz des Bundesstaates Pennsylvania erlaubt der Stadt Philadelphia (und nur Philadelphia), eine Lizenz für das Open-Carry-Gesetz in Philadelphia zu verlangen. nach Downtown Miami oder Downtown Tampa oder Downtown Orlando"", sagte Gualtieri. FAKT: Dieses Argument ist unlogisch und vielleicht absichtlich irreführend. Siebzig Prozent (70%) der amerikanischen Öffentlichkeit leben in Open-Carry-Staaten aus allen Regionen des Landes. Viele der 45 Open-Carry-Staaten haben große und vielfältige Städte, genau wie Florida, und wo Sie geografisch leben, ob Trilby, FL oder Fanning Springs, FL, haben Sie die gleichen verfassungsmäßigen Rechte wie Bürger, die in Miami, Tampa oder Orlando leben. „… das Hausfriedensbruchgesetz des Staates gibt Unternehmen das Recht, jeden, der offen eine Waffe trägt, aufzufordern, ihr Eigentum zu verlassen“, aber sie … „werden zögern, einer Person, die eine .45 trägt, zu sagen, dass sie gehen soll.“ FAKT: Das Anbringen von Schildern Das Verbot des offenen Tragens in einem Geschäftsbetrieb ist eine einfache Lösung. Eine ordnungsgemäße Benachrichtigung hält die Bürger davon ab, den Betrieb überhaupt zu betreten. Grundstückseigentümer müssen bereits Hausfriedensbruch-Schilder anbringen, um die Öffentlichkeit darauf hinzuweisen, dass sie sich von Privatgrundstücken fernhalten sollen. Unternehmen müssen t Das Recht, den Dienst zu verweigern und jeden zu vertreiben, den sie wollen, es sei denn, dies geschieht auf der Grundlage von Rasse, Geschlecht oder Religion. Außerdem sieht man häufig Schilder mit der Aufschrift „Kein Hemd, keine Schuhe – kein Service“. Warum zögern sie, Schilder mit der Aufschrift „Kein offenes Tragen von Schusswaffen“ anzubringen? FSA-BEHAUPTUNG: ""... wenn Sie McDonald's sind, können Sie niemanden davon ausschließen, seine Waffe auf den Tisch zu legen und dort zu sitzen und zu essen."" FAKT: Auch hier kann jedes Unternehmen einen Kunden wegen eines Verhaltens, das es für beleidigend, gefährlich oder unangemessen hält, aus dem Unternehmen werfen. Darüber hinaus ist es nach § 790.10 eine Straftat, eine Schusswaffe auf unhöfliche oder fahrlässige Weise auszustellen."	Steigende Schülerzahlen in der Grundschule	partially false
5daad203	"TALLAHASSEE – Als die Legislative von Florida ihre historische Sondersitzung beendete und am Dienstag eine überarbeitete Karte zur Umgliederung an den Obersten Gerichtshof des Bundesstaates zurückschickte, wurde eine andere Art von Geschichte geschrieben. Dutzende von Mitgliedern des State House waren freiwillig auf Wohnungssuche, kandidierten für ein anderes Amt oder planten, die nächste Legislaturperiode auszusetzen, um ein Matchup mit einem anderen Gesetzgeber zu vermeiden. Der Republikaner James Grant reichte am Dienstag Papiere ein, um in einem Bezirk von Pinellas-Hillsborough zu kandidieren, der ihn zwingen wird, sein derzeitiges Zuhause in Carrollwood zu verlassen. Rep. Perry Thurston, der neue demokratische Führer, plante, bei seiner Mutter einzuziehen. Der Republikaner Eddy Gonzalez plante, im Viertel Hialeah, in dem er aufgewachsen war, zu mieten. Und Rep. Scott Plakon aus Longwood war bereit, eine Stadt weiter mit seinem erwachsenen Sohn zusammenzuziehen. „Es ist historisch“, sagte Rep. Will Weatherford, der Republikaner der Wesley Chapel und neuer Sprecher des Repräsentantenhauses, der die Neuverteilung des Repräsentantenhauses leitete ein Gerichtsbeschluss."" Das Ergebnis, sagte er: ""Viel Blut, Schweiß und Tränen"" und eine allmähliche Erkenntnis, dass ""die Kontrolle über unser eigenes Schicksal und unsere eigenen Karten wichtiger war als die individuelle politische Agenda von irgendjemandem"". Das Repräsentantenhaus beendete am Dienstag die zweiwöchige Legislativsitzung zur Neuverteilung der Bezirke und stimmte mit 61 zu 47 Stimmen dafür, die überarbeitete Karte des Senats ohne Änderungen zu verabschieden. Der Oberste Gerichtshof von Florida hatte die erste Karte des Senats zurückgewiesen, weil sie die Anforderungen der neuen Fair Districts-Standards nicht befolgt hatte. Der neue Vorschlag, der optisch kompaktere Bezirke als der erste zu schaffen scheint, schafft auch einen republikanischen Mehrheitssitz weniger, was der GOP einen statistischen Vorteil von 23-15 mit zwei Swing-Bezirken verschafft. Die Demokraten verleumdeten die zweite Karte des Senats und sagten, sie sei mit vielen der gleichen Probleme behaftet wie die erste – vom Schutz der Amtsinhaber über die unerklärliche Teilung von Städten und Landkreisen bis hin zum fehlenden Schutz der Stimmenstärke von Minderheiten. „Wir sehen uns vor Gericht“, sagte die Sprecherin der Demokratischen Partei Floridas, Brannon Jordan, in einer knappen Erklärung. Die Republikaner von Miami-Dade schlossen sich den Demokraten an, um sich gegen die Karte zu stellen, und äußerten ihre Besorgnis darüber, dass der Vorschlag trotz enormer Gewinne nicht genügend hispanische Bezirke schafft Aber Weatherford sagte, er betrachte die Karte des Senats als verfassungsgemäß und warnte davor, dass die Ablehnung der Karte einen „sehr gefährlichen Präzedenzfall“ schaffen würde Weatherford glaubt, dass dies daran lag, dass die Gesetzgeber bereit waren, „den Prozess und die Kammer über sich selbst zu stellen.“ Er erinnert sich, dass er den Mitgliedern nach der Verabschiedung der Fair Districts im November 2010 gesagt hatte: „Davon wird es politisches Gemetzel geben.“ Für die nächsten 18 Monate, alle Gelegenheit hatte, sagte er, er würde „dieses Zuhause einfach einhämmern.“ „Es konditionierte die Mitglieder und ermöglichte ihnen, sich früh mit der Tatsache abzufinden, dass es ein harter Prozess werden würde“, sagte We sagte atherford am Dienstag. Um den Übergang zu erleichtern, versprach Weatherford jedem Mitglied des republikanischen Repräsentantenhauses, das in einen neuen Distrikt zog, dass er es während der Wahlsaison beschützen würde. „Es hat die Entscheidung für einige Mitglieder ein wenig einfacher gemacht“, sagte Rep. Carlos Lopez Cantera, der republikanische Vorsitzende des Repräsentantenhauses. Grant sagte jedoch, der Prozess sei „sehr hart“ gewesen. Grant wuchs nicht nur in dem Distrikt auf, den er jetzt vertritt , aber er lebt 500 Meter vom Haus seiner Eltern entfernt. Er zieht in einen neu gezeichneten Bezirk im Westen, der die Mehrheit seiner derzeitigen Wähler umfasst. Der Umzug bedeutet auch, dass Grant eine Vorwahl mit Rep. Shawn Harrison, R-Lutz, vermeiden wird. Niemand hat je damit gerechnet, dass ich Carrollwood verlasse“, sagte Grant. Aber er sagte, sein Vater, der ehemalige Staatssenator John Grant, habe schon früher Verwicklungen zur Neuverteilung gesehen und „bestand darauf, dass ich miete, anstatt zu kaufen, wenn ich renne“. Thurstons Umzug in das Haus seiner Mutter in Lauderhill wird ein Matchup mit Rep. Elaine Schwartz, D-Hollywood, vermeiden. „Es sind nur zwei Jahre“, sagte er, „jeder kann zwei Jahre lang alles tun.“ Rep. Scott Plakon, R-Longwood, wird mit seinem erwachsenen Sohn in einen benachbarten Distrikt ziehen, um nicht mit Rep. Chris Dorworth zusammengebracht zu werden , R-Lake Mary, der nach Weatherford Sprecher des Repräsentantenhauses werden soll. Nur zwei der derzeitigen Abgeordneten – die Abgeordneten Jose Felix Diaz und Ana Rivas Logan, beide Republikaner aus Miami – sehen einen Wechsel nicht als Option. Sie planen, dagegen anzukämpfen den ganzen Sommer für den einsamen Sitz. „Mein Haus gehört mir“, sagte Diaz am Dienstag. „Wenn die Wirtschaft anders wäre, könnte ich vielleicht umziehen, aber das ist keine Option.“ Die Nachrichtenkünstlerin der Times, Darla Cameron, hat zu diesem Bericht beigetragen."

c4f8a375	Ich war gerade im Buckingham Palace, wo mich Ihre Majestät, die Königin, gebeten hat, eine neue Regierung zu bilden, und ich habe zugesagt. Mit David Cameron trete ich in die Fußstapfen eines großen, modernen Premierministers. Unter Davids Führung stabilisierte die Regierung die Wirtschaft, verringerte das Haushaltsdefizit und verhalf mehr Menschen als je zuvor zur Arbeit. Aber Davids wahres Vermächtnis betrifft nicht die Wirtschaft, sondern soziale Gerechtigkeit. Von der Einführung der gleichgeschlechtlichen Ehe bis hin zur vollständigen Befreiung von Niedriglohnempfängern aus der Einkommenssteuer; David Cameron hat eine Ein-Nation-Regierung geführt, und in diesem Sinne plane ich auch zu führen. Denn nicht jeder weiß das, aber der vollständige Titel meiner Partei lautet Conservative and Unionist Party, und das Wort „Unionist“ ist mir sehr wichtig. Es bedeutet, dass wir an die Union glauben: das kostbare, kostbare Band zwischen England, Schottland, Wales und Nordirland. Aber es bedeutet etwas anderes, das ebenso wichtig ist; es bedeutet, dass wir an eine Union glauben, nicht nur zwischen den Nationen des Vereinigten Königreichs, sondern zwischen all unseren Bürgern, jedem von uns, wer auch immer wir sind und woher wir auch kommen. Das heißt, gegen die brennende Ungerechtigkeit anzukämpfen, dass man, wenn man arm geboren wird, durchschnittlich 9 Jahre früher stirbt als andere. Wenn Sie schwarz sind, werden Sie von der Strafjustiz härter behandelt als wenn Sie weiß sind. Wenn Sie ein weißer Junge aus der Arbeiterklasse sind, gehen Sie mit geringerer Wahrscheinlichkeit als jeder andere in Großbritannien an die Universität. Wenn du auf einer staatlichen Schule bist, erreichst du seltener die Spitzenberufe als wenn du privat ausgebildet wirst. Als Frau verdienst du weniger als ein Mann. Wenn Sie unter psychischen Problemen leiden, gibt es nicht genügend Hilfe zur Hand. Wenn Sie jung sind, wird es Ihnen schwerer denn je fallen, ein eigenes Haus zu besitzen. Aber die Mission, Großbritannien zu einem Land zu machen, das für alle arbeitet, bedeutet mehr als nur diese Ungerechtigkeiten zu bekämpfen. Wenn Sie aus einer gewöhnlichen Arbeiterfamilie stammen, ist das Leben viel härter, als viele Menschen in Westminster glauben. Sie haben einen Job, aber Sie haben nicht immer Arbeitsplatzsicherheit. Sie haben Ihr eigenes Haus, aber Sie machen sich Sorgen um die Zahlung einer Hypothek. Sie kommen gerade noch zurecht, aber Sie sorgen sich um die Lebenshaltungskosten und darum, Ihre Kinder auf eine gute Schule zu bringen. Wenn Sie eine dieser Familien sind, wenn Sie nur verwalten, möchte ich Sie direkt ansprechen. Ich weiß, dass Sie rund um die Uhr arbeiten, ich weiß, dass Sie Ihr Bestes geben, und ich weiß, dass das Leben manchmal ein Kampf sein kann. Die Regierung, die ich führe, wird nicht von den Interessen der wenigen Privilegierten geleitet, sondern von Ihren. Wir werden alles tun, um Ihnen mehr Kontrolle über Ihr Leben zu geben. Wenn wir die großen Anrufe entgegennehmen, denken wir nicht an die Mächtigen, sondern an Sie. Wenn wir neue Gesetze verabschieden, hören wir nicht auf die Mächtigen, sondern auf Sie. Wenn es um Steuern geht, priorisieren wir nicht die Reichen, sondern Sie. Wenn es um Gelegenheiten geht, werden wir die Vorteile der wenigen Glücklichen nicht festigen. Wir werden alles tun, um jedem zu helfen, unabhängig von seinem Hintergrund, so weit zu gehen, wie es seine Talente bringen. Wir erleben einen wichtigen Moment in der Geschichte unseres Landes. Nach dem Referendum stehen wir vor einer Zeit großer nationaler Veränderungen. Und ich weiß, weil wir Großbritannien sind, dass wir uns der Herausforderung stellen werden. Wenn wir die Europäische Union verlassen, werden wir uns eine mutige neue positive Rolle in der Welt erarbeiten, und wir werden Großbritannien zu einem Land machen, das nicht für wenige Privilegierte arbeitet, sondern für jeden von uns. Das wird die Mission der Regierung sein, die ich führe, und gemeinsam werden wir ein besseres Großbritannien aufbauen.	Die Gesundheitsbehörde von BRASILIEN hat bestätigt, dass ein Freiwilliger gestorben ist, nachdem er an den klinischen Studien des von AstraZeneca und der Universität Oxford entwickelten Coronavirus-Impfstoffs teilgenommen hatte. Die Gesundheitsbehörde des Landes, Anvisa, bestätigte, dass eine Person in Gerichtsverfahren gestorben ist. Es wird jedoch davon ausgegangen, dass der Mann anstelle des Impfstoffs ein Placebo eingenommen hat, und die von der Gesundheitsbehörde bestätigten Studien werden fortgesetzt. Das Medikament befindet sich derzeit in klinischen Studien der Phase drei. Brasilien hat Pläne, das Medikament zu kaufen und in seinem biomedizinischen Forschungszentrum herzustellen, wenn es die letzte Phase der Studien abschließt. Trotz des Todes des Freiwilligen hat die Universität Oxford erklärt, dass es keine Bedenken hinsichtlich der Sicherheit der Studien gibt. Der Impfstoff gilt als eines der führenden Medikamente, wobei die britische Regierung einen Vertrag über 100 Millionen Dosen unterzeichnet hat. Auch in den USA wurden Versuche mit dem Medikament seit dem 6. September ausgesetzt, nachdem ein Freiwilliger erkrankt war. Sowohl Indien als auch Südafrika haben die klinischen Studien mit dem potenziellen Impfstoff wieder aufgenommen. AstraZeneca hat außerdem eine Vereinbarung mit Europas Inclusive Vaccine Alliance unterzeichnet. Darunter könnten 400 Millionen Dosen zur Versorgung der an der Allianz teilnehmenden europäischen Länder bereitstehen. Großbritannien hat sich außerdem 30 Millionen Dosen eines separaten Medikaments von BioNtech/Pfizer gesichert. Ein weiteres Geschäft im Wert von 60 Millionen Dosen wurde ebenfalls mit Valneva vereinbart – insgesamt prüft die Regierung sechs Impfstoffe. Trotzdem ist ungewiss, wann ein Impfstoff in Umlauf kommt und wie erfolgreich er sein wird. Der wissenschaftliche Chefberater des Vereinigten Königreichs, Sir Patrick Vallance, warnte, dass es unwahrscheinlich sei, dass ein Medikament vor dem nächsten Frühjahr verfügbar sein werde. Im Gespräch mit dem Commons and Lords National Security Strategy Committee erklärte er, dass das Virus auch nicht vollständig ausgerottet werden werde. Er sagte: „Es ist unwahrscheinlich, dass wir am Ende einen wirklich sterilisierenden Impfstoff haben werden.“ Zuvor hatten Beamte behauptet, dass das von AstraZeneca hergestellte Medikament bis zum Jahreswechsel verfügbar sein könnte.Die Leiterin der britischen Vaccine Taskforce, Kate Bingham, sagte, sie sei optimistisch in Bezug auf die Chancen, dass ein Impfstoff von den britischen Kandidaten entwickelt wird. „Ich bin optimistisch, dass wir etwas sehen werden – vier unserer sechs Impfstoffe befinden sich jetzt in Phase-3-Studien, und in jedem von ihnen haben wir in den klinischen Studien der Phase eins und zwei sehr positive Daten gesehen, was zeigt, dass Menschen, die erhalten haben Der Impfstoff löst eine starke Immunantwort aus, und wenn Sie die neutralisierenden Antikörper einnehmen, die ausgelöst werden, können diese Antikörper lebende Covid-Viren abtöten. „Das ist also sehr positiv und so gut, wie es im Moment nicht sein kann.“ Und wir müssen jetzt sehen, ob diese Immunantworten, die wir sehen, in einen Schutz übergehen oder nicht.“ Dies kommt, da 26.688 Menschen positiv auf das Virus getestet wurden Großbritannien über alle Einstellungen hinweg – die Gesamtzahl liegt jetzt bei 789.229.Es wurden heute auch 191 Todesfälle gemeldet.	true
7273a6ce	Schreiben an den Herausgeber der Washington Post von Herrn Dmitry Polyanskiy, Erster stellvertretender Ständiger Vertreter der Russischen Föderation bei den Vereinten Nationen, in Bezug auf den Artikel mit dem Titel „Eine Meldung aus dem Kampf gegen russische Desinformation – und ein Ort, an dem die Wahrheit gewinnt“ Sehr geehrter Herr Baron, ich muss Sie in Bezug auf den Artikel mit dem Titel „Eine Meldung aus dem Kampf gegen russische Desinformation – und ein Ort, an dem die Wahrheit gewinnt“ von Herrn Philip Bump ansprechen, der am 25. Juli in „The Washington Post“ veröffentlicht wurde 2018, was mich persönlich im Zusammenhang mit einem für uns sehr sensiblen Thema erwähnt – der Untersuchung des Absturzes der Malaysia Airlines MH17 2014 in der Ukraine. Ich möchte betonen, dass ich diesen Brief in meiner Eigenschaft als Privatperson schreibe und nicht direkt in relevante Ermittlungsbemühungen auf unserer Seite involviert bin. Aber selbst die Informationen, die in offenen Quellen verfügbar sind und von jedem Forscher nachvollzogen werden könnten, erlauben mir, die Schlussfolgerungen zu ziehen, die ich ziehe. Ich möchte nicht verhehlen, dass ich von dieser Veröffentlichung, die eindeutig nicht den Maßstäben einer unvoreingenommenen journalistischen Berichterstattung entspricht, sehr enttäuscht war. Seine Hauptbotschaft besteht darin, angebliche „russische Bemühungen, die Erkenntnisse“ von „unabhängigen Ermittlern“ und „Propagandabemühungen der russischen Regierung“ im Allgemeinen zu untergraben, zu veranschaulichen. Unnötig zu sagen, dass der Artikel von der Annahme ausgeht, dass Russland hinter dem Abschuss von MH17 steckt und alle unsere Bemühungen nur darauf abzielen, die Schuldigen zu vertuschen. Ich bin mit einer solchen Erzählung überhaupt nicht einverstanden und möchte diesbezüglich einige wichtige Punkte klarstellen. Von Anfang an war und ist Russland ernsthaft daran interessiert, die Wahrheit über dieses tragische Ereignis herauszufinden. Wir haben alle Bemühungen um eine umfassende und transparente Untersuchung unterstützt, wir haben unseren Einfluss auf die Rebellen im Donbass ausgeübt, die trotz der sehr schwierigen Kampfsituation, die durch die Besessenheit der ukrainischen Behörden verursacht wurde, ihre eigenen Bürger mit militärischer Gewalt für ihren Wunsch zu bestrafen, ihre Sprache und Kultur zu bewahren , ermöglichte einen ungehinderten und vollständigen Zugang zur Absturzstelle. Alle, die es besuchen wollten, hatten die Gelegenheit dazu. Alle materiellen Beweise wurden ebenfalls gesammelt und zu Ermittlungszwecken in die Niederlande transportiert. Wir von unserer Seite haben dem Untersuchungsteam viele Informationen und Materialien zur Verfügung gestellt, insbesondere Primärradardaten. Russland hat auf Anfrage geheime Informationen über die Buk-Raketen 9M38 und 9M38M1 offengelegt. Unser Hersteller dieser Munition „Almaz-Antey“ modellierte auch den Vorfall und weit verbreitete technische Daten und die Schlussfolgerungen dieser Simulation. Der niederländischen Seite sind auch viele Zeugenaussagen von Menschen bekannt, die in diesem Gebiet leben. Wir bekundeten und bekunden weiterhin unsere Bereitschaft, uns der Ermittlergruppe anzuschließen. Dennoch zeigten die niederländischen Ermittler von Anfang an besonderes Misstrauen gegenüber unseren Erkenntnissen und Beiträgen. Russische Experten wurden von ihrer Arbeit ausgeschlossen. Viele der von uns bereitgestellten Daten wurden in den Berichten ignoriert und nicht berücksichtigt. Der Trend war sehr klar – alles zu ignorieren, was die ukrainische Verantwortung für den Abschuss von MH17 aufdeckte, und jede Behauptung zu unterstützen, sei sie undokumentiert oder sogar absurd, dass Russland oder „von Russland unterstützte Rebellen“ dahinter stecken. Es reicht aus, darauf hinzuweisen, dass die Ermittler die USA nicht drängen, Satellitendaten von dem Tag bereitzustellen, an dem die Amerikaner öffentlich bestätigten, dass sie solche Daten besitzen, aber sie sind „klassifiziert“ und akzeptieren die Weigerung der Ukraine, primäre Daten bereitzustellen Radardaten unter lächerlichem Vorwand. Die Weigerung der ukrainischen Behörden, den Luftraum über dem östlichen Teil des Landes am Tag des Absturzes zu sperren, obwohl die ukrainischen Streitkräfte dort weiterhin Militäroperationen durchführen, was mit keiner Logik zu erklären ist, wird ebenfalls nicht berücksichtigt. In Ermangelung vertrauenswürdiger Beweise dafür, dass „die Russen es getan haben“, begannen die niederländischen Ermittler, sich immer mehr auf soziale Medien und die Ergebnisse von Ermittlergruppen wie Bellingcat zu verlassen, die im Mittelpunkt des Artikels stehen. Für uns ist die ganze Idee, Social-Media-Konten als Beweis für Ermittlungen zu verwenden, äußerst bizarr und zweifelhaft. Heutzutage ist es kein Problem mehr, Videos oder Fotos mit leicht verfügbarer Software zu fälschen. Wir haben auch viele Gründe, insbesondere Bellingcat nicht zu vertrauen, das wiederholt von Internetnutzern auf frischer Tat ertappt wurde, indem es auf der Grundlage von Fälschungen antirussische oder antisyrische Anschuldigungen äußerte. Und diese Fälschungen werden weitgehend im Web aufgedeckt. Internetnutzer haben viele Fragen zur Bellingcat-Finanzierung, wichtige amerikanische und westliche Fonds, die traditionell antirussische Kampagnen unterstützen, sollen die Hauptsponsoren dieser „Ermittler“ sein, was offensichtliche Zweifel an ihrer Unparteilichkeit aufkommen lässt. Außerdem gibt es viele andere Internet-Social-Media-Ermittler im Internet, die Dinge behaupten, die den „Erkenntnissen“ von Bellingcat entgegengesetzt sind, die eindeutig darauf hindeuten, dass die Ukraine hinter dem Abschuss von MH17 steckt. Warum werden sie ignoriert, während Bellingcat-Konten gelobt und nicht hinterfragt werden? Ich persönlich habe versucht, über meinen Twitter-Account @dpol_un mit Bellingcat in Kontakt zu treten. Aber in dem Moment, in dem ich an ihrer Unparteilichkeit zweifelte und auf ihre Bitte hin illustrierte, dass sie Fälschungen produzieren, sah ich mich einem bösartigen verbalen Angriff von ihnen ausgesetzt, einschließlich ihres Gründers Elliot Higgins, der, wie in dem Artikel behauptet wurde, „internationale Aufmerksamkeit für seine umfassende – und genaue – Analyse erlangte ...“. Zuerst sagten sie, dass ich nicht existiere, und nannten mich „Kreml-Bot“ – eine übliche Taktik für diejenigen, die die Meinung der anderen im Web missachten. Ich muss sagen, dass mich dieser „Journalisten-Held“ am meisten enttäuscht hat, als er persönliche Beleidigungen über Twitter verschickte. Ich füge einige der Schnappschüsse als Referenz bei. Nachdem mich die Bellingcats, ihre Trolle und Bots weiter beleidigten, musste ich einige von ihnen auf die schwarze Liste setzen, darunter auch Higgins. Natürlich folgten bis heute keine Entschuldigungen, was sehr illustrativ für die Qualität ihrer „Arbeit“ ist. Wie können sich „verantwortliche Ermittler“ so verhalten? Es gibt Hunderte von Internetnutzern, die bereits ihre Lügen aufgedeckt haben, und alles, was die Bellingcats tun, ist, diese Nutzer anzugreifen und zu schikanieren. Sie haben einfach keine anderen Argumente als Beleidigungen und erbärmliche Lügen. Ich glaube, dass die Tatsache, dass Sie ihre Bemühungen loben und die Augen vor all den zahlreichen begründeten Behauptungen verschließen, dass sie Fälschungen produzieren, dem Ruf Ihres angesehenen Blattes nicht zuträglich ist. Es gibt den niederländischen Ermittlern auch keine Ehre. Aber lassen wir die Bellingcats beiseite, lassen wir sie von ihrem Gewissen beurteilen, sie verdienen offensichtlich nicht so viel Aufmerksamkeit. Was mich am meisten beunruhigt, ist, dass wir nach vier Jahren des tragischen Unfalls von MH17 immer noch sehr weit von der Wahrheitsfindung entfernt sind. Leider ist der jüngste Vorstoß des Joint Investigation Teams, Russland auf der Grundlage der Ergebnisse von bellingcats, nicht schlüssiger und fehlender Daten aus der Ukraine und den USA und unter völliger Missachtung unserer Daten und Dokumente verantwortlich zu machen, ein weiterer Schritt in diese völlig falsche Richtung. Und die Versuche, die Gefühle der Angehörigen der Opfer auszunutzen, sie zur Unterstützung dieser unbegründeten Behauptungen zu mobilisieren, sind absolut unmoralisch. Mein Land ist weiterhin bereit, sich internationalen Ermittlungsbemühungen anzuschließen, um die Wahrheit über den MH17-Absturz herauszufinden. Wir unterstützen auch konsequent die Bemühungen, die Verantwortlichen dieses Verbrechens zu finden und vor Gericht zu stellen. Russland muss Teil des Ermittlungsteams sein und nicht sein Objekt – niemand hat das Prinzip der Unschuldsvermutung aufgehoben. Was wir nicht akzeptieren, sind Ultimaten und Fälschungen. Angesichts der Tatsache, dass mein Name in dem oben genannten Artikel in einem sehr zweifelhaften Zusammenhang zitiert wurde, bitte ich Sie respektvoll, meinen Brief in Ihrer Zeitung zu veröffentlichen. Ich werde es auch öffnen und auf der Website unserer Ständigen Vertretung veröffentlichen.

8fba8857	In einem Szenario direkt aus „The Twilight Zone“ hat eine Gruppe von NASA-Wissenschaftlern, die an einem Experiment in der Antarktis arbeiten, Beweise für ein Paralleluniversum entdeckt – wo die Regeln der Physik laut einem Bericht das Gegenteil von unseren sind. Das Konzept eines Paralleluniversums gibt es seit den frühen 1960er Jahren, hauptsächlich in den Köpfen von Fans von Science-Fiction-TV-Shows und Comics, aber jetzt hat ein Experiment zur Detektion kosmischer Strahlen Partikel gefunden, die aus einem parallelen Reich stammen könnten, das ebenfalls geboren wurde im Urknall, berichtete der Daily Star. Die Experten verwendeten einen riesigen Ballon, um die Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) der NASA hoch über die Antarktis zu tragen, wo die kalte, trockene Luft die perfekte Umgebung mit wenig bis gar keinem Funkrauschen bot, um ihre Ergebnisse zu verfälschen. Ein konstanter „Wind“ hochenergetischer Teilchen kommt ständig aus dem Weltraum auf die Erde. Niedrigenergetische, subatomare Neutrinos mit einer Masse nahe Null können die Erde vollständig durchdringen, aber energiereichere Objekte werden laut dem Bericht von der festen Materie unseres Planeten gestoppt. ANITA Antarctic Hang TestUniversity of Hawai'i at Manoa; Das heißt, die hochenergetischen Teilchen können nur aus dem Weltraum „herunterkommen“, aber die ANITA des Teams detektierte schwerere Teilchen, sogenannte Tau-Neutrinos, die aus der Erde „herauf“ kommen. Der Befund impliziert, dass diese Partikel tatsächlich in der Zeit zurückreisen, was laut Daily Star auf Beweise für ein Paralleluniversum hindeutet. Der leitende ANITA-Forscher Peter Gorham, ein experimenteller Teilchenphysiker an der Universität von Hawaii, schlug vor, dass sich das Tau-Neutrino nur dann so verhalten könnte, wenn es sich in eine andere Art von Teilchen verwandelt, bevor es die Erde durchquert und dann wieder zurück. Gorham, Hauptautor einer Abhandlung der Cornell University, die das seltsame Phänomen beschreibt, bemerkte, dass er und seine Forscherkollegen mehrere dieser „unmöglichen Ereignisse“ gesehen hatten, denen einige skeptisch gegenüberstanden. „Nicht jeder war mit der Hypothese zufrieden“, sagte er gegenüber New Scientist. Die einfachste Erklärung für das Phänomen ist, dass im Moment des Urknalls vor 13,8 Milliarden Jahren zwei Universen entstanden sind – unseres und eines, das aus unserer Sicht mit der Zeit rückwärts läuft. Natürlich, wenn es irgendwelche Bewohner eines möglichen Paralleluniversums gibt, würden sie uns als die Rückständigen betrachten. „Uns bleiben die spannendsten oder langweiligsten Möglichkeiten“, sagt Ibrahim Safa, der auch an dem Experiment mitgearbeitet hat.

20968b72	Energieminister Rick Perry sagt, er glaube nicht, dass CO2-Emissionen aus menschlichen Aktivitäten der Hauptgrund für den Klimawandel seien. Diese Ansicht steht im Widerspruch zu den Schlussfolgerungen der Environmental Protection Agency, der NASA und der National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. EPA-Administrator Scott Pruitt sagte im März gegenüber CNBC, er glaube nicht, dass die globale Erwärmung hauptsächlich durch CO2 verursacht wird. Energieminister Rick Perry sagte am Montag gegenüber CNBC, er glaube nicht, dass Kohlendioxidemissionen aus menschlichen Aktivitäten der Hauptgrund für den Klimawandel seien, und schloss sich dem EPA-Administrator an, um Zweifel an der Schlussfolgerung einiger WB_wombat_top-Wissenschaftler der Regierung zu äußern. Auf die Frage, ob CO2-Emissionen in erster Linie für den Klimawandel verantwortlich sind, sagte Perry gegenüber CNBCs „Squawk Box“: „Nein, höchstwahrscheinlich ist der primäre Kontrollknopf das Meerwasser und diese Umwelt, in der wir leben.“ „Tatsache ist, dass dies keine Debatte darüber sein sollte, ‚Ändert sich das Klima, hat der Mensch einen Einfluss darauf?‘ Ja, das tun wir. Die Frage sollte lauten, wie viel und welche politischen Änderungen wir vornehmen müssen, um dies zu bewirken?“ er sagte. Im März sagte der Administrator der Umweltschutzbehörde, Scott Pruitt, gegenüber „Squawk Box“, er glaube nicht, dass Kohlendioxid ein Hauptfaktor für die globale Erwärmung sei. Diese Aussagen widersprechen zumindest bis vor kurzem der öffentlichen Haltung der Environmental Protection Agency. Sek. Perry: Kernenergie zurückbringen Auf der Webseite der EPA über die Ursachen des Klimawandels hieß es früher: „Kohlendioxid ist das wichtigste Treibhausgas, das zum jüngsten Klimawandel beiträgt.“ Die EPA hat kürzlich die Webseite mit dieser Aussage entfernt. Die Ansichten von Perry und Pruitt stehen auch im Widerspruch zu der Schlussfolgerung der NASA und der National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Trotz dieser Schlussfolgerungen sagte Perry: „Diese Idee, dass die Wissenschaft einfach absolut geklärt ist, und wenn Sie nicht glauben, dass sie entschieden ist, dann sind Sie irgendwie ein weiterer Neandertaler, das ist aus meiner Sicht so unangemessen.“ Skeptiker in Bezug auf den Klimawandel zu sein, sei „völlig in Ordnung“, sagte er und deutete an, dass Skepsis ein Zeichen für eine „weise, intellektuell engagierte Person“ sei. Präsident Donald Trump kündigte diesen Monat an, dass er die Vereinigten Staaten aus dem Pariser Klimaabkommen herausziehen werde, einem internationalen Versuch, die Auswirkungen der globalen Erwärmung abzumildern. Seitdem haben sich die meisten Stellvertreter des Präsidenten geweigert zu sagen, ob er an den Klimawandel glaubt. Die Trump-Administration hat vorgeschlagen, die Mittel des Energieministeriums zu kürzen. Das Energieministerium schließt das Büro für Internationales Klima und Technologie, das mit anderen Ländern zusammenarbeitet, um saubere Energietechnologien zu entwickeln, berichtete die New York Times letzte Woche. Unter Trump haben die Vereinigten Staaten auch von einer Zusage Abstand genommen, die Forschungs- und Entwicklungsausgaben für Energietechnologie bis 2021 auf 6,4 Milliarden Dollar zu verdoppeln.

Siehe unsere Datenschutzerklärung „Ich möchte an unseren Fortschritten gemessen werden.“ Nicola Sturgeons eigene Worte im Jahr 2015, wenige Monate nachdem sie bei den Parlamentswahlen 56 Sitze gewonnen hatte. Am 8. Juni haben die Wähler die Möglichkeit, sie anhand ihrer Bilanz zu beurteilen. Wir alle wissen, dass Sturgeons einzige Priorität ein zweites Unabhängigkeitsreferendum ist. Jeder einzelne gewählte SNP-Abgeordnete hat dieselbe Priorität – er wird nach Westminster gehen, um für die Unabhängigkeit zu kämpfen, nicht, um sich für Schottland einzusetzen. (Bild: 2017 Getty Images) Und während Sturgeon und ihre Abgeordneten den Blick vom Ball nehmen, werden die öffentlichen Dienste, für die die SNP hier in Schottland zuständig ist, vernachlässigt. Hier ist die Wahrheit hinter dem SNP-Spin. Die Gesundheitsbehörden von NHS Scotland könnten unter der SNP-Regierung mit einer Kürzungsbombe in Höhe von 1 Milliarde Pfund konfrontiert werden, und lokale Dienste in ganz Schottland sind bedroht. Als Gesundheitsminister strich Sturgeon Ausbildungsplätze für Krankenschwestern – und nannte dies einen „vernünftigen Weg nach vorne“. Schottland hat jetzt mehr als 2500 offene Stellen für Krankenschwestern und Hebammen.

Aber der Plan von Labour, in den öffentlichen Dienst in England zu investieren, wird zu einem massiven Schub für Schottlands Haushalt führen. BILDUNG Im Rahmen des SNP ist die Lehrerzahl um 4000 zurückgegangen, es gibt 1000 weniger Hilfskräfte und Schottlands Leistung bei internationalen Bewertungen in Mathematik, Naturwissenschaften und Lesen ist rückläufig. Unterdessen bleibt die Kluft im Bildungsniveau, die Kinder aus reicheren und ärmeren Verhältnissen trennt, so hartnäckig wie eh und je. Im Jahr 2007 trat die SNP mit einem wichtigen Versprechen auf, die Studentenverschuldung abzuschaffen, was sie gebrochen hat. Stattdessen ist die Verschuldung der Studenten in die Höhe geschossen. Aber die Bildungspolitik von Labour in England wird zu einem erheblichen Ausgabenschub für Schottland führen. (Bild: PA/Getty) POLIZEI Seit der chaotischen Zentralisierung von Police Scotland durch die SNP ist die Polizeiarbeit von einer Krise zur nächsten gestolpert. Audit Scotland hat ein schwarzes Loch im Herzen des Budgets von Police Scotland aufgezeigt. Die Zahl der Vollzeitpolizisten ist im vergangenen Jahr zurückgegangen, während das Versäumnis der SNP, ihr Versprechen von 1000 zusätzlichen Beamten vollständig zu finanzieren, dazu geführt hat, dass Beamte an vorderster Front Back-Office-Funktionen übernehmen müssen, anstatt im Takt zu sein. Unter einer Labour-Regierung wird Schottland 70 Millionen Pfund erhalten, die wir verwenden können, um sicherzustellen, dass sich die Beamten auf die Überwachung und den Schutz unserer Gemeinden konzentrieren können. TRANSPORT (Bild: Getty) Große Straßenbauprojekte haben sich verzögert, die Busverbindungen verschlechtern sich und die Zufriedenheit mit ScotRail ist auf einem 14-Jahres-Tief. Anstatt auf Labour zu hören und einen öffentlichen Eisenbahndienst zu schaffen, übergab die SNP das ScotRail-Franchise an den niederländischen staatlichen Betreiber Abellio. Dies hat dazu geführt, dass Passagiere unter Verspätungen, Annullierungen, Überfüllung und Fahrpreiserhöhungen leiden. Die Arbeit wird immer die kostenlose Busfahrkarte der Rentner ab 60 Jahren schützen. Die Wahrheit ist, dass niemand dem SNP-Manifest vertrauen kann, das Sturgeon heute enthüllen wird. Wähler, die ihr eine Botschaft senden wollen, um Pläne für ein spaltendes zweites Unabhängigkeitsreferendum fallen zu lassen und sich auf den Betrieb unserer Schulen und Krankenhäuser zu konzentrieren, müssen am 8. Juni Labour wählen.	Der Tag des jüngsten Gerichts für die scheiternde Regierung von Nicola Sturgeon naht	true
99fc8e17	von Sen. Doug Whitsett Mehr als ein Dutzend Gesetzentwürfe im Zusammenhang mit Schusswaffen wurden während der kürzlich abgeschlossenen 77. gesetzgebenden Versammlung eingebracht. Die meisten dieser Gesetzesvorlagen hätten in gewisser Weise unser zweites Änderungsrecht auf den Besitz und das Tragen von Schusswaffen beeinträchtigt. Einige der aggressiveren Rechnungen beinhalteten: • House Bill 3200, der das Verbrechen des rechtswidrigen Besitzes oder der rechtswidrigen Weitergabe einer Angriffswaffe oder eines Magazins mit großer Kapazität geschaffen hätte, das mit bis zu 10 Jahren Gefängnis, einer Geldstrafe von bis zu 250.000 US-Dollar oder beide. • House Bill 3413, der das Verbrechen geschaffen hätte, einen Minderjährigen zu gefährden, indem dem Minderjährigen der Zugang zu einer Schusswaffe ermöglicht wurde, was mit bis zu einem Jahr Gefängnis, einer Geldstrafe von bis zu 6.250 $ oder beidem bestraft werden könnte. • SB 347, der es jedem Schulbezirk erlaubt hätte, seine eigenen Regeln bezüglich des Rechts aufzustellen, eine lizenzierte versteckte Waffe auf dem Schulgelände zu tragen. Ein Verstoß gegen das Gesetz hätte eine kriminelle Hausfriedensbruch darstellt und zu Strafen von bis zu einem Jahr Gefängnis, einer Geldstrafe von bis zu 6.250 USD oder beidem geführt. Dieser Gesetzentwurf hätte auch dem aktuellen Gesetz vorgegriffen, das es nur dem Gesetzgeber erlaubt, Gesetze zur Regulierung von Schusswaffen zu erlassen. • SB 699, das das Recht eingeschränkt hätte, eine versteckte Waffe im Kapitolgebäude durch die meisten lizenzierten Personen ohne die schriftliche Genehmigung der gesetzgebenden Verwaltung zu tragen. • SB 700, bei dem eine Zuverlässigkeitsüberprüfung erforderlich gewesen wäre, bevor eine Schusswaffe zwischen Privatpersonen transferiert werden konnte. Das Versäumnis, die Zuverlässigkeitsüberprüfung abzuschließen, hätte zu Strafen von bis zu 5 Jahren Gefängnis, Geldstrafen von bis zu 125.000 US-Dollar oder beidem führen können. • SB 758, der den Besitzer einer Schusswaffe verpflichtet hätte, eine spezielle Haftpflichtversicherung für jede Schusswaffe in seinem Besitz abzuschließen. Es machte es auch zu einem Verbrechen, eine Schusswaffe an eine andere Person zu übertragen, es sei denn, diese Person hatte eine Haftpflichtversicherung für die Waffe. Das Versäumnis, eine Haftpflichtversicherung für jede Schusswaffe zu unterhalten, hätte zu Geldstrafen von bis zu 10.000 US-Dollar pro Schusswaffe geführt. • SB 796, das den Abschluss eines Kurses für verdeckte Handfeuerwaffen erfordert hätte, einschließlich eines Live-Feuertests, bevor eine Lizenz für verdeckte Handfeuerwaffen ausgestellt werden konnte. Es ist unklar, warum unser Gesetzgeber seine Aufmerksamkeit darauf richten sollte, die Anforderungen zum Erhalt einer Erlaubnis zum verdeckten Tragen zu erhöhen. Es scheint, dass sich niemand an das letzte Mal erinnern kann, als ein Waffenlizenznehmer aus Oregon ein Verbrechen mit einer Schusswaffe begangen hat. Jede dieser Rechnungen, mit Ausnahme von HB 3413, war mit einer Notfallklausel versehen. Der einzige Grund für die Notstandsklausel wäre gewesen, zu verhindern, dass der Gesetzentwurf dem Volk zur Entscheidung vorgelegt wird. Keine dieser Rechnungen wurde in das Gesetz von Oregon aufgenommen. Der Hauptgrund, warum die Gesetzentwürfe nicht angenommen wurden, war, dass die Senatsführung wusste, dass die kombinierten 15 Nein-Stimmen von 14 Republikanern im Senat und von Senatorin Betsy Johnson jeden der Gesetzentwürfe im Senat besiegt hätten. Aus diesem Grund durften sie nie zur Abstimmung in den Senat kommen. Aus meiner Sicht ist diese Stimmenzahl viel zu nah dran, um sich zu trösten. Ihre gesetzgebende Versammlung war nur eine Stimme davon entfernt, jeden dieser Gesetzentwürfe in das Gesetz von Oregon zu überführen. Es war innerhalb einer Stimme, um unsere zweiten Änderungsrechte grob zu beeinträchtigen. Leider sind sich zu viele Menschen einfach nicht der Fakten über den Besitz von Waffen und die Begehung von Verbrechen im Zusammenhang mit Waffen bewusst. Tatsächlich sind die meisten Familien durch Medienberichte davon überzeugt, dass Verbrechen im Zusammenhang mit Waffen in Amerika zunehmen. Das stimmt einfach nicht! In den letzten zwanzig Jahren ist die Zahl der mit Schusswaffen begangenen Tötungsdelikte in den Vereinigten Staaten um fast 40 Prozent zurückgegangen. Auch die Zahl anderer Straftaten mit Schusswaffengebrauch ist um fast 70 Prozent zurückgegangen. Unbeabsichtigte Todesfälle durch Schusswaffen sind seit 1993 um fast 60 Prozent zurückgegangen und seit 1929 um mehr als 80 Prozent zurückgegangen. Dieser dramatische Rückgang der Zahl der mit Schusswaffen begangenen Verbrechen ist im gleichen Zeitraum aufgetreten, in dem unsere nationale Bevölkerung von 250 angewachsen ist Millionen bis 315 Millionen Menschen. In den gleichen zwanzig Jahren wurden mehr als 100 Millionen Waffen an Privatpersonen in den Vereinigten Staaten verkauft. 43 Prozent der US-Haushalte geben jetzt an, eine oder mehrere Schusswaffen zu besitzen. Ich könnte mir vorstellen, dass der Prozentsatz des Waffenbesitzes tatsächlich viel höher ist als angegeben, weil viele Leute, die Schusswaffen besitzen, es nicht vorziehen, irgendjemanden wissen zu lassen, dass sie diese Waffen haben. Alle Anzeichen deuten darauf hin, dass unsere Gesellschaft sicherer wird, je verantwortungsbewusstere Familien Waffen besitzen. Nichtsdestotrotz ist Waffengewalt das dritthäufigste Ereignis, über das unsere Nachrichtenmedien berichten. Diese Meldequote wird nur noch von Verkehrs- und Wettermeldungen übertroffen. Die Medien berichten fast nie über die täglichen Ereignisse, bei denen Gewalt durch einen bewaffneten Bürger verhindert wird. Es ist diese ständige Voreingenommenheit der Medien, die in erster Linie dafür verantwortlich ist, dass die Menschen glauben, dass Waffengewalt zunimmt. Meiner Meinung nach ist unser wichtigstes Recht als Bürger der Vereinigten Staaten unser in der Verfassung garantiertes zweites Verfassungszusatzrecht auf den Besitz und das Tragen von Schusswaffen. Im Laufe der aufgezeichneten Geschichte hat jeder Möchtegern-Diktator und Despot zuerst die Menschen davon überzeugt, abzurüsten, angeblich um ihre Gesellschaft zu einem sichereren und friedlicheren Ort zum Leben zu machen. Sobald sie ihre Schusswaffen aufgegeben haben, werden ihnen systematisch alle anderen Menschenrechte entzogen. Wir dürfen nicht zulassen, dass oberflächliche Politiker und mitschuldige Nachrichtenmedien uns davon überzeugen, dass wir ohne Schusswaffen sicherer sind. Wir sind nicht sicherer. Wir sind wehrlos.

7d021245	"Die Telefonnummer zur Meldung der Ergebnisse der Iowa-Caucus wurde am Montagabend auf einem Rand-Internet-Messageboard veröffentlicht, zusammen mit der Aufforderung, „die Leitungen zu verstopfen“, ein Hinweis darauf, dass blockierte Telefonleitungen, die einige Caucus-Manager stundenlang in der Warteschleife ließen, teilweise fällig gewesen sein könnten Scherzanrufe. Ein Beamter der Demokratischen Partei von Iowa sagte, der Zustrom von Anrufen bei der Melde-Hotline umfasste „Anhänger von Präsident Trump, die anriefen, um ihren Unmut über die Demokratische Partei auszudrücken“. Die Kommentare des Parteibeamten wurden erstmals am späten Mittwoch von Bloomberg News gemeldet. Benutzer in einem politisch orientierten Bereich des Rand-4chan-Messageboards posteten wiederholt die Telefonnummer der Iowa Democratic Party, die durch eine einfache Google-Suche gefunden wurde, sowohl als Screenshots als auch im Klartext, neben Anweisungen. „Sie müssen die Ergebnisse jetzt anrufen. Sehr lange Wartezeiten werden gemeldet. Telefonleitung ist verstopft“, postete ein Benutzer gegen 23 Uhr. ET am Montag, drei Stunden nach Beginn der Versammlungen. ""Oh oh, wie unglücklich wäre es für einen Haufen Unfugmacher, wenn sie anfangen würden, die Leitungen zu verstopfen"", antwortete ein anderer anonymer Benutzer sarkastisch. Einige Benutzer mischten sich ein, posteten angebliche Wartezeiten in der Warteschleife und flehten andere an, „die Leitungen zu verstopfen [und] die Anrufer zu tätigen“. Rob Sand, Staatsprüfer von Iowa, sagte, er habe am Montagabend als Freiwilliger Ergebnisanrufe entgegengenommen und einen Zustrom von Anrufen erhalten, die anscheinend von einem Post im Internet generiert wurden. „Viele Anrufe gingen an einem bestimmten Punkt ein, an dem klar war, dass jemand die Hotline-Nummer irgendwo veröffentlicht hatte“, sagte Sand. Er warnte davor, dass er nicht für andere Personen sprechen könne, die Anrufe entgegennahmen, und sagte, er habe keine Anrufe erhalten, die besagten, dass sie von Trump-Anhängern stammten. Er fügte hinzu, dass das System Menschen daran hindere, gefälschte Ergebnisse zu melden. Er sagte auch, dass er in der Lage war, gefälschte Anrufe schnell zu identifizieren. „Wenn ich den Hörer abnahm und nach den ersten paar Worten klar war, dass niemand anruft, um die Ergebnisse zu melden, habe ich einfach aufgelegt“, sagte Sand. Mandy McClure, Kommunikationsdirektorin der Iowa Democratic Party, bestätigte, dass die Hotline „eine ungewöhnlich hohe Anzahl eingehender Anrufe bei ihrer Caucus-Hotline, einschließlich Unterstützern von Präsident Trump“, erhielt. „Die unerklärlichen und manchmal feindseligen Anrufe trugen zur Verzögerung bei der Erfassung der Ergebnisse der Demokratischen Partei von Iowa bei, beeinträchtigten jedoch in keiner Weise die Integrität der gesammelten Informationen oder die Genauigkeit der gemeldeten Datensätze“, sagte McClure in einer Erklärung. Die Probleme mit der telefonischen Berichterstattung kamen zu anderen Problemen hinzu, insbesondere einer Smartphone-App, die für einige Leute nicht funktionierte und die auch ein Codierungsproblem aufwies, das die ordnungsgemäße Berichterstattung der Ergebnisse verhinderte, wodurch mehr Freiwillige der Caucus an die Telefonleitungen gedrängt wurden. Beamte der Demokratischen Partei von Iowa sagten, dass Mitarbeiter und Freiwillige der Partei wiederholte Anrufer markiert und anschließend blockiert hätten, die anscheinend versuchten, ihre Meldepflichten zu stören. Dazu gehörten Anrufer, die sofort auflegten, nachdem sie verbunden waren, und Anrufer, die ihre Unterstützung für Trump und ihren Unmut über die Demokratische Partei zum Ausdruck brachten. Es ist unklar, wie viele Streichanrufe die Partei erhalten hat oder wie viel sie zu Wartezeiten beigetragen haben. Einige Anrufe kamen von Iowanern, die Einzelheiten ihres abendlichen Caucus bestätigen wollten, sagten Parteibeamte. Die Partei hat auf Anfragen nach Informationen darüber, wie viele Personen am Montagabend die Telefonleitungen besetzt hatten, nicht geantwortet. Die Trump-Kampagne bestritt am Montagabend jegliche Verbindung zu Menschen, die Telefonleitungen verstopften. „Wir wissen nichts darüber, aber vielleicht sollten die Demokraten erwägen, eine App zu verwenden, die funktioniert“, sagte Kommunikationsdirektor Tim Murtaugh. „Es ist lächerlich, dass sie versuchen würden, Trump für ihre eigene Inkompetenz verantwortlich zu machen.“ Reporter von NBC News hatten mit langen Wartezeiten zu kämpfen, die es ihnen unmöglich machten, Ergebnisse zu melden gezielte Belästigungskampagnen. An Debattenabenden befehlen sich 4chan-Nutzer oft gegenseitig, bestimmte Online-Umfragen auf anderen Websites mit wiederholten Abstimmungen zu manipulieren, eine Praxis, die in Online-Communities als „Brigaden“ bekannt ist. Die Umfragen würden dann von Politikern und parteiischen Websites verwendet um schockierende Aufregungen zu behaupten. Benutzer auf 4chan sind anonym und Benutzernamen werden zufällig mit jedem neuen Thread generiert. Einige Benutzer auf 4chan wehrten sich dagegen Benutzer, die behaupten, am Montagabend Telefonleitungen zu spammen. Ein Benutzer sagte, er wolle nicht, dass andere Trolle „uns zum Sündenbock für den DNC machen“. „Ich kann die Schlagzeilen kaum erwarten, die besagen, dass ruchlose Trolle den Caucus ruiniert haben“, fügte ein anderer hinzu. Zwei Bezirksvorsitzende sagten, sie seien sich keiner Störung der Hotline bewusst und bezweifelten, dass dies eine große Wirkung habe. „Ich würde den Republikanern keinen Vorwurf machen“, sagte Tom Courtney, Co-Vorsitzender der Des Moines County Democratic Party und Bezirksvorsitzender. „Ich würde gerne den Republikanern und den Trumpern die Schuld geben, aber ich weiß es nicht.“ Mike Carberry, Vorsitzender eines Bezirks in Iowa City, sagte auch, er bezweifle, dass Streichanrufe der Hauptgrund für lange Wartezeiten seien. „Ich bin mir sicher, dass sie einige Anrufe bekommen haben, aber diese konnten relativ schnell bearbeitet werden“, sagte er. Ein anderer Hotline-Mitarbeiter, der anonym bleiben wollte, sagte, er wisse von den Scherzanrufen, sie seien aber nicht der Hauptgrund für die Verzögerung der Ergebnisse. „Es war definitiv ein Problem“, sagte der Mitarbeiter. „Aber das war definitiv nicht der Grund dafür, dass die Ergebnisse durcheinander waren.“"	Die Leitungen verstopfen': Internet-Trolle unterbrachen absichtlich die Hotline der Iowa-Caucuses, um Ergebnisse zu melden	other
bf9f2cd6	Tony Abbott: Daring To Doubt 2017 Annual GWPF Lecture The Honourable Tony Abbott MP Former Prime Minister of Australia ‘Daring To Doubt’ London, 9 October 2017 Thank you for giving me the same platform that you’ve previously given to fellow Australians John Howard and George Pell. I will strive to be worthy of their example and their friendship; to offer a common sense way through the climate conflict; and, also, to place this particular issue in the broader struggle for practical wisdom now taking place across the Western world. It would be wrong to underestimate the strengths of the contemporary West. By objective standards, people have never had better lives. Yet our phenomenal wealth and our scientific and technological achievements rest on values and principles that have rarely been more widely challenged. To a greater or lesser extent, in most Western countries, we can’t keep our borders secure; we can’t keep our industries intact; and we can’t preserve a moral order once taken for granted. Eventually, something will crystalize out of this age of disruption but in the meantime we could be entering a period of national and even civilizational decline. In Australia, we’ve had ten years of disappointing government. It’s not just the churn of prime ministers that now rivals Italy’s, the internal divisions and the policy confusion that followed a quarter century of strong government under Bob Hawke and John Howard. It’s the institutional malaise. We have the world’s most powerful upper house: a Senate where good government can almost never secure a majority. Our businesses campaign for same sex marriage but not for economic reform. Our biggest company, BHP, the world’s premier miner, lives off the coal industry that it now wants to disown. And our oldest university, Sydney, now boasts that its mission is “unlearning”. Of course, to be an Australian is still to have won the lottery of life, and there’s yet no better place to live and work. But there’s a nagging sense that we’re letting ourselves down and failing to reach anything like our full potential. We are not alone in this. The Trump ascendancy, however it works out, was a popular revolt against politics-as-usual. Brexit was a rejection of the British as well as of the European establishments. Yes, the centrist, Macron, won in France but only by sidelining the parties that had ruled from the start of the Fifth Republic. And while the German chancellor was re-elected, seemingly it’s at the head of an unstable coalition after losing a quarter of her vote. Everywhere, there’s a breakdown of public trust between voters and their leaders for misdiagnosing problems, for making excuses about who’s to blame, and for denying the damage that’s been done. Since the Global Financial Crisis, at least in the West, growth has been slow, wages stagnant, opportunities limited, and economic and cultural disruption unprecedented. Within countries and between them, old pecking orders are changing. Civilizational self-doubt is everywhere; we believe in everyone but ourselves; and everything is taken seriously except that which used to be. Just a few years ago, history was supposed to have ended in the triumph of the Western liberal order. Yet far from becoming universal, Western values are less and less accepted even in the West itself. We still more or less accept that every human being is born with innate dignity; with rights, certainly, but we’re less sure about the corresponding duties. We still accept the golden rule of human conduct: to treat others as we would have them treat us – or to use the Gospel formula to “love your neighbour as you love yourself” – but we’re running on empty. In Britain and Australia, scarcely 50 per cent describe themselves as Christian, down from 90 per cent a generation back. For decades, we’ve been losing our religious faith but we’re fast losing our religious knowledge too. We’re less a post-Christian society than a non-Christian, or even an anti-Christian one. It hasn’t left us less susceptible to dogma, though, because we still need things to believe in and causes to fight for; it’s just that believers can now be found for almost anything and everything. Climate change is by no means the sole or even the most significant symptom of the changing interests and values of the West. Still, only societies with high levels of cultural amnesia – that have forgotten the scriptures about man created “in the image and likeness of God” and charged with “subduing the earth and all its creatures” – could have made such a religion out of it. There’s no certain way to regain cultural self-confidence. The heart of any recovery, though, has to be an honest facing of facts and an insistence upon intellectual rigour. More than ever, the challenge of leadership is to say what you mean and do what you say. The lesson I’ve taken from being in government, and then out of it, is simply to speak my mind. The risk, when people know where you stand, is losing their support. The certainty, when people don’t know where you stand, is losing their respect. Of course, we’re all nostalgic for the days when governments and oppositions could agree on the big issues; but pleading for bi-partisanship won’t create it. As my government showed on border protection policy, the only way to create a new consensus is to argue the case, to make a decision, and then to let the subsequent facts speak for themselves. The modern world, after all, is not the product of a successful search for consensus. It’s what’s emerged from centuries of critical enquiry and hard clash. Without the constant curiosity and endless questioning that has driven our scientists and engineers, and the constant striving for improvement that’s long guided our planners and policy makers, there’d be no cures for disease, no labour-saving appliances, no sanitation, no urban improvement, no votes for women, no respect for minorities; in other words, no modern world. That may not actually bother some green activists whose ideal is an Amish existence, only without reference to God. But it should bother anyone and everyone who wants longer, safer, more comfortable and more prosperous lives. Beware the pronouncement, “the science is settled”. It’s the spirit of the Inquisition, the thought-police down the ages. Almost as bad is the claim that “99 per cent of scientists believe” as if scientific truth is determined by votes rather than facts. There are laws of physics; there are objective facts; there are moral and ethical truths. But there is almost nothing important where no further enquiry is needed. What the “science is settled” brigade want is to close down investigation by equating questioning with superstition. It’s an aspect of the wider weakening of the Western mind which poses such dangers to the world’s future. Physics suggests, all other things being equal, that an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide would indeed warm the planet. Even so, the atmosphere is an almost infinitely complex mechanism that’s far from fully understood. Palaeontology indicates that over millions of years there have been warmer periods and cooler periods that don’t correlate with carbon dioxide concentrations. The Jurassic warm period and the ice ages occurred without any human contribution at all. The medieval warm period when crops were grown in Greenland and the mini-ice age when the Thames froze over occurred well before industrial activities added to atmospheric carbon dioxide. Prudence and respect for the planet would suggest taking care not lightly to increase carbon dioxide emissions; but the evidence suggests that other factors such as sun spot cycles and oscillations in the Earth’s orbit are at least as important for climate change as this trace gas – which, far from being pollution, is actually essential for life to exist. Certainly, no big change has accompanied the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration over the past century from roughly 300 to roughly 400 parts per million or from 0.03 to 0.04 per cent. Contrary to the breathless assertions that climate change is behind every weather event, in Australia, the floods are not bigger, the bushfires are not worse, the droughts are not deeper or longer, and the cyclones are not more severe than they were in the 1800s. Sometimes, they do more damage but that’s because there’s more to destroy, not because their intensity has increased. More than 100 years of photography at Manly Beach in my electorate does not suggest that sea levels have risen despite frequent reports from climate alarmists that this is imminent. It may be that a tipping point will be reached soon and that the world might start to warm rapidly but so far reality has stubbornly refused to conform to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s computer modelling. Even the high-priests of climate change now seem to concede that there was a pause in warming between the 1990s and 2014. So far, though, there’s no concession that their models might require revision even though unadjusted data suggests that the 1930s were actually the warmest decade in the United States and that temperatures in Australia have only increased by 0.3 degrees over the past century, not the 1 degree usually claimed. The growing evidence that records have been adjusted, that the impact of urban heat islands has been downplayed, and that data sets have been slanted in order to fit the theory of dangerous anthropogenic global warming does not make it false; but it should produce much caution about basing drastic action upon it. Then there’s the evidence that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide (which is a plant food after all) are actually greening the planet and helping to lift agricultural yields. In most countries, far more people die in cold snaps than in heat waves, so a gradual lift in global temperatures, especially if it’s accompanied by more prosperity and more capacity to adapt to change, might even be beneficial. In what might be described as Ridley’s paradox, after the distinguished British commentator: at least so far, it’s climate change policy that’s doing harm; climate change itself is probably doing good; or at least, more good than harm. Australia, for instance, has the world’s largest readily available supplies of coal, gas and uranium, yet thanks to a decade of policy based more on green ideology than common sense, we can’t be sure of keeping the lights on this summer; and, in the policy-induced shift from having the world’s lowest power prices to amongst the highest, our manufacturing industry has lost its one, big comparative economic advantage. About 20 years ago, in Australia, limiting carbon dioxide emissions first became a goal of public policy. It was the Howard government, back in 1997, that originally introduced the Renewable Energy Target, a stealth carbon tax, requiring energy suppliers to source a percentage of their power from new renewable generation. But in those far off days, it was just 2 per cent. During the energy discussions around the Howard cabinet table, I recall thinking “why not encourage more solar hot water systems to reduce power use” and “why not incentivise the installation of solar panels to help power people’s homes”? Way back in the 1980s, in my final provost’s collection at The Queen’s College, Lord Blake had observed: “Mr Abbott needs to temper his robust common sense with a certain philosophic doubt”. If only more of us had realised sooner how easy it was with renewable power to have too much of a good thing! Unsurprisingly, a conservative cabinet did indeed respond to farmers’ worries about the drought then gripping eastern Australia; and the public’s then eagerness to support environmental gestures with other people’s money. We thought we could reduce emissions, or at least limit their increase, without much disruption to everyday life, hence these gestures to the zeitgeist. Where the subsidy was modest and the impact on the power system minimal, our thinking ran, why not accommodate the feel-good urge to be “responsible global citizens”? In its last few months, the Howard government even agreed in-principle to support an emissions trading scheme. But Howard was shrewd enough to know how the most important consequences of any policy were often the unintended ones. His government’s refusal to ratify the Kyoto climate change treaty, even though we’d secured a good deal for Australia, showed his caution about the impact of emissions reduction on power prices and the wider economy. For the incoming Labor Prime Minister after 2007, though, climate change was nothing less than the “greatest moral challenge of our time”. The Rudd-Gillard government believed in an emissions trading scheme, no ifs, no buts, and in a ten-fold increase in the mandatory use of renewables. For a while, the Liberal-National opposition was inclined to go along with it. My own leaning for the first year or so was not to oppose it; but my doubts about the theory of climate change were growing and my sense that an ETS would turn out to be a “great big new tax on everything” was hardening. To a party audience in country Victoria in October 2009, I observed that the so-called settled science of climate change was “absolute crap”; and after winning the opposition leadership had a secret party room ballot to oppose an ETS because it was not our job to enter into weak compromises with a bad government. As it happened, the 2010 election was more about power prices than about saving the planet. Under great political pressure, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard, declared “there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead”. But early in 2011, as part of her minority government’s deal with the Greens, she committed to a carbon tax that would put wholesale power prices up by 40 per cent. The 2013 election was a referendum on Labor’s carbon tax – as well as Labor’s complete loss of control over our maritime borders – with a thumping win to the Liberal-National Coalition. In July 2014, the Abbott government abolished the carbon tax, saving the average household about $500 a year. In early 2015, we reduced the Renewable Energy Target from 28 to 23 per cent. It wasn’t enough, but it was the best that we could get through the Senate. My cabinet always had some ministers focussed on jobs and cost of living; and others more concerned with emissions reduction, even though our contribution to global emissions was barely one per cent. Inevitably, our Paris agreement to a 26 to 28 per cent emissions reduction was a compromise based on the advice that we could achieve it largely through efficiencies, without additional environmental imposts, using the highly successful emissions reduction fund; because, as I said at the time, “the last thing we want to do is strengthen the environment (but) damage our economy”. At last year’s election, the government chose not to campaign on power prices even though Labor was promising a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target (requiring a $50 billion over-build of wind farms) and a 45 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 (requiring a new carbon tax). After a net gain of 25 seats at the previous two elections, when we had campaigned on power prices, we had a net loss of 14 when we didn’t. And subsequent events have made the politics of power once more the central battleground between and within the two main parties. Although manufacturing, agriculture and transport are also large carbon dioxide emitters, the politics of emissions reduction has always focussed on power generation because shifting to renewables has always been more saleable to voters than closing down industry, giving up cars and not eating beef. As a badge of environmental virtue, the South Australian state Labor government had been boasting that, on average, almost 50 per cent of its power was wind-generated – although at any moment it could vary from almost zero to almost 100 per cent. It had even ostentatiously blown up its one coal-fired power station. In September last year, though, the wind blew so hard that the turbines had to shut down – and the inter-connector with Victoria and its reliable coal-fired power failed too. For 24 hours, there was a state wide blackout. For nearly two million people, the lights were off, cash registers didn’t work, traffic lights went down, lifts stopped, and patients were sent home from hospitals. Throughout last summer, there were further blackouts and brownouts across eastern Australia requiring hundreds of millions in repairs to the plant of energy-intensive industries. Despite this, in a display of virtue signalling, to flaunt its environmental credentials (and to boost prices for its other coal-fired plants), last March the French-government part-owned multinational, Engie, closed down the giant Hazelwood coal-fired station that had supplied a quarter of Victoria’s power. The Australian Energy Market Operator is now sufficiently alarmed to have just issued an official warning of further blackouts this summer in Victoria and South Australia and severe medium term power shortfalls. But in yet more virtue-signalling, energy giant AGL is still threatening to close the massive Liddell coal-fired power station in NSW and replace it with a subsidised solar farm and a much smaller gas-fired power station relying on gas supplies that don’t currently exist. Were it not rational behaviour based on irrational government policy, this deliberate elimination of an essential service could only be described as a form of economic self-harm. Hydro aside, renewable energy should properly be referred to as intermittent and unreliable power. When the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine, the power doesn’t flow. Wind and solar power are like sailing ships; cheaper than powered boats, to be sure, but we’ve stopped using sail for transport because it couldn’t be trusted to turn up on time. Because the weather is unpredictable, you never really know when renewable power is going to work. Its marginal cost is low but so is its reliability, so in the absence of industrial scale batteries, it always needs matching capacity from dependable coal, gas, hydro, or nuclear energy. This should always have been obvious. Also now apparent is the system instability and the perverse economics that subsidised renewables on a large scale have injected into our power supply. Not only is demand variable but there’s a vast and unpredictable difference between potential and dispatch-able capacity at any one time. Having to turn coal fired power stations up or down as the wind changes makes them much less profitable even though coal remains by far the cheapest source of reliable power. A market that’s driven by subsidies rather than by economics always fails. Subsidy begets subsidy until the system collapses into absurdity. In Australia’s case, having subsidised renewables, allegedly to save the planet; we’re now faced with subsidising coal, just to keep the lights on. We have got ourselves into this mess because successive federal governments have tried to reduce emissions rather than to ensure reliable and affordable power; because, rather than give farmers a fairer return, state governments have given in to green lobbyists and banned or heavily restricted gas exploration and extraction; and because shareholder activists have scared power companies out of new investment in fossil fuel power generation, even though you can’t run a modern economy without it. In the short term, to avoid blackouts, we have to get mothballed or under-utilised gas back into the system. In the medium term, there must be – first – no subsidies, none, for new intermittent power (and a freeze on the RET should be no problem if renewables are as economic as the boosters claim); second, given the nervousness of private investors, there must be a government-built coal-fired power station to overcome political risk; third, the gas bans must go; and fourth, the ban on nuclear power must go too in case a dry country ever needs base load power with zero emissions. The government is now suggesting that there might not be a new Clean Energy Target after all. There must not be – and we still need to deal with what’s yet to come under the existing target. In the longer term, we need less theology and more common sense about emissions reduction. It matters but not more than everything else. As Clive James has suggested in a celebrated recent essay, we need to get back to evidence based policy rather than “policy based evidence”. Even if reducing emissions really is necessary to save the planet, our effort, however Herculean, is barely-better-than-futile; because Australia’s total annual emissions are exceeded by just the annual increase in China’s. There’s a veneer of rational calculation to emissions reduction but underneath it’s about “doing the right thing”. Environmentalism has managed to combine a post-socialist instinct for big government with a post-Christian nostalgia for making sacrifices in a good cause. Primitive people once killed goats to appease the volcano gods. We’re more sophisticated now but are still sacrificing our industries and our living standards to the climate gods to little more effect. So far, climate change policy has generated new taxes, new subsidies and new restrictions in rich countries; and new demands for more aid from poor countries. But for the really big emitters, China and India, it’s a first world problem. Between them, they’re building or planning more than 800 new coal-fired power stations – often using Australian coal – with emissions, on average, 30 per cent lower than from our own ageing generators. Unsurprisingly, the recipients of climate change subsidies and climate change research grants think action is very urgent indeed. As for the general public, of course saving the planet counts – until the bills come in and then the humbug detector is switched on. Should Australia close down its steel industry; watch passively while its aluminium industry moves offshore to places less concerned about emissions; export coal, but not use it ourselves; and deliberately increase power prices for people who can’t install their own solar panels and batteries? Of course not, but these are the inevitable consequences of continuing current policies. That’s the reality no one has wanted to face for a long time: that we couldn’t reduce emissions without also hurting the economy; that’s the inconvenient truth that can now no longer be avoided. The only rational choice is to put Australian jobs and Australia’s standard of living first; to get emissions down but only as far as we can without putting prices up. After two decades’ experience of the very modest reality of climate change but the increasingly dire consequences of the policy to deal with it, anything else would be a dereliction of duty as well as a political death wish. I congratulate the Global Warming Policy Foundation for your commitment to rational inquiry; your insistence that the theory must be made to fit the facts, rather than the other way round; your concern to do good, rather than just to seem good; and for the hope I share with you: that, in the end, the best policy will turn out to be the best politics. I’m reminded of the story of a man randomly throwing pieces of paper from the window of a train. Eventually his companion asked him why he did it. It keeps the elephants down, he said. “But there are no elephants here”, his companion replied. “Precisely; it’s a very successful method”. A tendency to fear catastrophe is ingrained in the human psyche. Looking at the climate record over millions of years, one day it will probably come; whatever we do today won’t stop it, and when it comes, it will have little to do with the carbon dioxide emissions of mankind.

9f10a8a9	Es war eine genaue und vernünftige Antwort, die Klimaalarmisten natürlich in Anfälle der Verurteilung versetzte. Die Washington Post kritisierte Pruitt als „Leugner“, getrieben von „Unvernunft“. Senator Brian Schatz aus Hawaii nannte Pruitts Ansichten „extrem“ und „unverantwortlich“ – ein Beweis für seine Unfähigkeit, die EPA zu leiten. Gina McCarthy, die die Agentur unter Präsident Obama leitete, beklagte die Gefahr, die die globale Erwärmung „für uns alle darstellt, die die Erde ihr Zuhause nennen“, und sagte, sie könne sich „nicht vorstellen, welche zusätzlichen Informationen [Pruitt] von Wissenschaftlern verlangen könnte“, um dies zu tun verstehe das. Antwortete Pruitt: „Nein. Ich denke, dass es sehr schwierig ist, die menschliche Aktivität auf das Klima genau zu messen, und es gibt enorme Meinungsverschiedenheiten über das Ausmaß der Auswirkungen. Also nein – ich würde nicht zustimmen, dass es ein Hauptfaktor für die globale Erwärmung ist, die wir sehen. Aber das wissen wir noch nicht. Wir müssen die Debatte fortsetzen und die Überprüfung und Analyse fortsetzen.“ „Glauben Sie“, fragte Joe Kernen von CNBC letzten Donnerstag in einem Interview mit Scott Pruitt, dem neuen Direktor der Environmental Protection Agency, „dass bewiesen ist, dass CO2 der wichtigste Regler für das Klima ist?“ Doch trotz all des Hyperventilierens war Pruitts Antwort auf die Frage, die ihm gestellt wurde – ob Kohlendioxid der „primäre Kontrollknopf“ des Klimas ist – völlig vernünftig. „Das wissen wir noch nicht“, sagte er. Wir nicht. CO2 ist sicherlich ein wärmespeicherndes Treibhausgas, aber kaum das primäre: Wasserdampf macht etwa 95 Prozent der Treibhausgase aus. Im Gegensatz dazu ist Kohlendioxid in der Atmosphäre nur ein Spurenbestandteil: etwa 400 ppm (parts per million) oder 0,04 Prozent. Außerdem nimmt seine wärmende Wirkung nach den ersten 20 oder 30 ppm stark ab. Der Atmosphäre mehr CO2-Moleküle hinzuzufügen, ist wie eine rote Wand mit weißer Farbe zu übermalen – der erste Anstrich erledigt die meiste Arbeit, um das Rot zu kaschieren. Ein zweiter Anstrich hat viel weniger Wirkung, während ein dritter oder vierter Anstrich fast überhaupt keine Auswirkungen hat. Es gibt eine populäre Theorie, dass atmosphärisches CO2 die Entstehung von Wasserdampf verstärkt und dadurch die Erwärmung durch eine „positive Rückkopplungsschleife“ erhöht. Aber diese Theorie ist bisher größtenteils spekulativ; Klimaprojektionen, die darauf basierende Modelle verwenden, sind durchweg gescheitert und haben fast immer eine weitaus stärkere Erwärmung vorhergesagt, als tatsächlich eingetreten ist. Es versteht sich von selbst, dass, wenn Wissenschaftler noch keine genauen Vorhersagen über den zukünftigen Klimawandel treffen können, ihr Verständnis der Klimawissenschaft höchst unvollständig bleibt. Das Klimasystem der Erde ist unergründlich komplex. Es wird von unzähligen interagierenden Variablen beeinflusst, wobei der atmosphärische CO2-Gehalt nur einer ist. Je mehr Variablen es in einem System oder einer Folge von Ereignissen gibt, desto geringer ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass sie alle eintreten. Ihre Chancen, das Ergebnis einer geworfenen Münze richtig zu erraten, sind 1 zu 2, aber Ihre Chancen, zweimal hintereinander richtig zu erraten, sind nur 1 zu 4 – d.h. ½ x ½. Die Verlängerung Ihrer Siegesserie auf einen dritten Tipp ist sogar noch unwahrscheinlicher: nur 1 von 8. Wenden Sie diesen Ansatz auf den Klimawandel an, und es wird klar, warum die beste Antwort auf die hektischen Vorhersagen der Alarmisten eine gesunde Skepsis ist. Die Liste der Variablen, die das Klima beeinflussen, umfasst Wolkenbildung, Topographie, Höhe, Nähe zum Äquator, Plattentektonik, Sonnenfleckenzyklen, vulkanische Aktivität, Expansion oder Kontraktion des Meereises, Umwandlung von Land in Landwirtschaft, Entwaldung, Wiederaufforstung, Windrichtung, Bodenqualität, El Niño- und La Niña-Ozeanzyklen, Verbreitung von Aerosolen (Ruß, Staub und Salz in der Luft) – und natürlich atmosphärische Treibhausgase, sowohl natürliche als auch vom Menschen verursachte. Eine umfassende Liste würde Hunderte, wenn nicht Tausende von Elementen umfassen, von denen Wissenschaftler keines mit absoluter Präzision zu verstehen beanspruchen würden. Aber um der Argumentation willen sagen wir, dass es nur 15 Variablen gibt, die an der Vorhersage des globalen Klimawandels beteiligt sind, und gehen davon aus, dass Klimatologen jede einzelne mit einer nahezu perfekten Genauigkeit von 95 Prozent gemeistert haben. Wie stehen die Chancen, dass ein Klimamodell, das auf einem so einfachen System basiert, zuverlässig wäre? Weniger als 50/50. (Die 15-fache Multiplikation von 0,95 mit sich selbst ergibt 46,3 Prozent.) Ist es eine Überraschung, dass Vorhersagen zum Klimawandel in der realen Welt – wo die Komplexität exponentiell größer und die Genauigkeit des Wissens viel geringer ist – eine so schlechte Bilanz haben? Pruitt hat es richtig gemacht: Die Messung der menschlichen Auswirkungen auf das Klima ist in der Tat „sehr herausfordernd“. Die Wissenschaft ist noch lange nicht am Ende. Aus diesem Grund sind Aufrufe zur radikalen Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen so unverantwortlich – und deshalb sind düstere Warnungen vor dem, was passieren wird, wenn wir es nicht tun, kaum besser als rücksichtslose Panikmache.

Sie argumentierten, dass es Alternativen zum traditionellen Klatschen gegeben habe in einigen Organisationen seit 2015 eingeführt, um die Zugänglichkeit zu verbessern. Das Klatschenverbot würde bei Treffen und Veranstaltungen der Studentenvereinigung gelten, bei denen traditionelles Klatschen und Jubeln für Menschen mit Angststörungen „ein Zugangsproblem darstellt“. Ein ehemaliger Student sagte: „Die Studentenvereinigung der Universität Oxford ist immer bestrebt, Studenten entgegenkommender zu sein. Besonders für Menschen mit Barrierefreiheitsproblemen. ""Aber diese Idee wird nicht funktionieren und ist völlig lächerlich.""

53d111d0	Die Grundschulpopulation in England ist mit 94.000 zusätzlichen Schülern in diesem Jahr weiter stark gestiegen und erreichte den höchsten Stand seit den 1970er Jahren. Der Anstieg der Grundschülerzahlen um 2,1 % entspricht sechs zusätzlichen Schülern pro Schule. Schüler aus ethnischen Minderheiten machten 71 % des Anstiegs aus, heißt es im Schulzählungsbericht des Bildungsministeriums. Die jährlichen Zahlen zeigen, dass es jetzt mehr übergroße Grundschulen gibt. Es bedeutet mehr Finanzierungsbedarf, um zusätzliche Plätze zu schaffen, und Druck auf Plätze für Familien, die nach Schulen suchen. Inzwischen gibt es 87 Grundschulen mit mehr als 800 Schülern, gegenüber 77 im Jahr 2014 und 58 im Jahr 2013. Die Zahl der Kleinkinder in den Klassen über der 30-Schüler-Grenze ist wieder gestiegen – mit 100.800 Schülern in diesen übergroßen Klassen eine Steigerung von 8 % gegenüber 2014. Die Zahl hat sich seit 2012 mehr als verdoppelt, als es etwa 47.000 Kleinkinder in Klassen mit mehr als 30 Kindern gab. 2008 waren es weniger als 25.000. Demografischer Wandel Die Zahlen der jährlichen Schulzählung zeigen einen Anstieg im gesamten staatlichen Schulsystem – um 2,1 % in der Grundschule und um 0,1 % in der Sekundarstufe – auf insgesamt 8,4 Millionen Schüler. Das ist eine Zunahme um etwa 200.000 Kinder in zwei Jahren. Die steigende Bevölkerungszahl war eine besondere Herausforderung für die Grundschulen, die erweitert werden mussten, um die steigende Zahl aufzunehmen. Doch diese steigende Bevölkerungswelle hat mittlerweile die weiterführenden Schulen erreicht. Die Analyse besagt, dass der Anstieg der Grundschulzahlen vor allem durch die steigende Zahl von Schülern aus ethnischen Minderheiten verursacht wird, auf die mehr als zwei Drittel des Anstiegs entfallen. In den Grundschulen gehören 30,4 % der Schüler einer ethnischen Minderheit an, verglichen mit 29,5 % im Vorjahr. Aber es gibt große regionale Unterschiede. In den inneren Londoner Bezirken gehören 81 % der Schüler ethnischen Minderheiten an; während im Nordosten Englands die Zahl unter 11 % liegt. Und auf Gemeindeebene gehören in Newham 94 % der Schüler ethnischen Minderheiten an, während die Zahl in Durham unter 5 % liegt. Die größte ethnische Gruppe in der Grundschule in Inner London sind schwarze Schüler, überwiegend mit afrikanischem Hintergrund, die zweitgrößte Gruppe sind asiatische Schüler. In weiterführenden Schulen gehören etwa 27 % der Schüler ethnischen Minderheiten an, was dem Bericht zufolge eine Zunahme von etwa 30 % in sechs Jahren darstellt. Trotz steigender Schülerzahlen ist die Zahl der Grundschulen, die seit den 1980er Jahren kontinuierlich zurückgegangen ist, nicht gewachsen. Stattdessen wurden die Grundschulen größer, mit mehr Schülern in Schulen mit mehr als 800 Schülern. Bis 2009 waren die Grundschülerzahlen rückläufig, seitdem steigen sie jedoch stark an. „Gute Schule vor Ort“ Die Finanzierung dieses Bedarfs an zusätzlichen Plätzen – für die nächsten fünf Jahre werden weitere 460.000 prognostiziert – belastet das Schulbudget kontinuierlich. Im Bundestagswahlkampf haben sich die Konservativen dazu bekannt, die Ausgaben pro Schüler zu schützen, auch bei steigenden Zahlen. Ein DfE-Sprecher sagte: Die durchschnittliche Klassengröße von Kleinkindern ist stabil bei 27,4 geblieben, und die Zahl der unrechtmäßig großen Kleinkindklassen ist gesunken – um 137 im Vergleich zu 2009 – trotz eines leichten Anstiegs der Schülerzahlen seit letztem Jahr. Um den Schulen zu helfen, auf steigende Schülerzahlen zu reagieren, investierte die Regierung zwischen 2011 und 2015 5 Mrd. £, um die lokalen Behörden zu unterstützen und fast eine halbe Million neue Plätze zu schaffen. Darüber hinaus haben wir uns verpflichtet, in den nächsten sechs Jahren weitere 7 Mrd. £ in neue Schulplätze zu investieren, um die benötigten neuen Schulplätze bis September 2021 zu unterstützen. Die Regierung hat außerdem seit 2010 über 250 kostenlose Schulen eröffnet und wir setzen uns dafür ein, während dieses Parlaments mindestens 500 weitere zu schaffen, über 400.000 neue Schulplätze zu schaffen und sicherzustellen, dass noch mehr Eltern Zugang zu einer guten örtlichen Schule für ihr Kind haben. Tristram Hunt, Sekretär für Schattenbildung bei Labour, sagte: „Der wachsende Druck auf die Klassengröße der Grundschulen sollte die Regierung dazu zwingen, die Mittelzuweisung für Schulen zu überdenken. Der Fall ist klar. In den ersten Jahren der Grundschule machen Kinder in Klassen mit 30 eher bessere Fortschritte. Es kann nicht sinnvoll sein, dass die Regierung weiterhin Geld für neue kostenlose Schulen in Gebieten mit überschüssigen Schulplätzen priorisiert, wenn wir mehr als 100.000 Grundschüler haben, die in Klassen mit mehr als 30 unterrichtet werden.	in	partially false

Mai 2016 Repräsentantin Celia Israel enttäuscht von Gerichtsurteil, das das Schulfinanzsystem für verfassungswidrig hält, fordert sofortige Sondersitzung Austin – Repräsentantin Celia Israel (D-Travis County) bittet Gouverneurin Abbott um Anruf eine Sondersitzung zur vollständigen Finanzierung der öffentlichen Bildung im Lichte der heutigen Entscheidung des Obersten Gerichtshofs von Texas, in der das derzeitige, erschreckend unzureichende Schulfinanzierungssystem bestätigt wird. „Ich bin sehr enttäuscht über das heutige Urteil des Obersten Gerichtshofs von Texas. Es war besonders überraschend zu sehen, dass das Gericht unser System gleichzeitig als ‚byzantinisch‘ und ‚Mindeststandards erfüllen‘ bezeichnet.“ sagte Israel. „Texas hat etwas Besseres verdient. Wir können nicht weiter über unser Wirtschaftswachstum schreien und so tun, als würde ein ‚byzantinisches‘ System unseren Kindern und unserer Zukunft gut tun. Ich fordere Gouverneur Abbott auf, sofort eine Sondersitzung einzuberufen, damit Texas voll investieren kann sein Bildungssystem."" Israel drückte seine Enttäuschung über das Urteil des Gerichts aus, mit dem Richter John Dietz niedergeschlagen wurde, der feststellte, dass der Gesetzgeber die tatsächlichen Bildungskosten und die Auswirkungen der erheblichen Kürzungen während der Sitzung 2011 ignorierte, während die Standards für texanische Schüler erhöht und die Schulen aufgefordert wurden, ausgefeiltere Programme anzubieten. Das Urteil des Gerichts scheint der Legislative das letzte Wort darüber zu lassen, ob Texas seinen verfassungsmäßigen Auftrag erfüllt, „geeignete Vorkehrungen für die Unterstützung und Aufrechterhaltung eines effizienten Systems öffentlicher Schulen zu treffen“. Inflationsbereinigt sind die Ausgaben pro Student in den letzten 16 Jahren relativ unverändert geblieben. Trotz dieses Trends werden die Schulen in Texas im Jahr 2017 381 US-Dollar weniger pro Schüler erhalten als im Jahr 2003. Es würde weitere 3,5 Milliarden US-Dollar im nächsten Zweijahreszeitraum erfordern, nur um unsere Schulen dorthin zu bringen, wo sie vor 14 Jahren standen. Gleichzeitig bleibt die staatliche Unterstützung für öffentliche Schulen weiterhin hinter den Kosten der Inflation zurück, berücksichtigt keine Änderungen der Schülerbedürfnisse oder akademischen Standards und finanziert die Distrikte nicht gerecht. „Es ist Zeit für große Ideen und eine Führung von texanischer Größe“, sagte Israel und merkte an, dass ihre Wähler den „Weiter so wie bisher“-Ansatz zur Bildungsfinanzierung nicht länger akzeptieren werden, selbst mit dem Urteil des Gerichts. „Ich bin zuversichtlich, dass meine Kollegen auf beiden Seiten des Mittelgangs zusammenarbeiten werden, um ein öffentliches Schulsystem zu schaffen, das die Ressourcen bereitstellt, die alle Schüler benötigen, um erfolgreich zu sein, unabhängig davon, wo sie leben oder welchen Hintergrund sie haben.

Als Antwort auf diese Nachricht sagte Battles: „Danke, Partner. Sie haben hinter den Kulissen viel getan, um Miami zu einem Erfolg zu machen. Wir werden weiter zusammenarbeiten.“ Er signierte die E-Mail einfach Tommy. Carswell antwortete: „Deshalb machen wir das große Geld.“ Das gemäß dem Civil Rights Act von 1964 eingerichtete CRS des Justizministeriums, dessen Mitarbeiter gesetzlich verpflichtet sind, „ihre Aktivitäten vertraulich durchzuführen“, hat Berichten zufolge seine Rolle unter Präsident Barack Obama stark ausgebaut. Obwohl die Agentur behauptet, „unparteiische Vermittlungspraktiken und Konfliktlösungsverfahren“ anzuwenden, deuten Presseberichte zusammen mit den von Judicial Watch erhaltenen Dokumenten darauf hin, dass die nach Sanford, FL, entsandte Einheit eine aktive Rolle bei der Zusammenarbeit mit denjenigen spielte, die die Strafverfolgung von Zimmerman fordern. Am 15. April 2012, während des Höhepunkts der Proteste, berichtete der Orlando Sentinel: „Sie [der CRS] halfen bei der Organisation eines Treffens zwischen der örtlichen NAACP und gewählten Beamten, das laut Turner zum vorübergehenden Rücktritt von Polizeichef Bill Lee führte Clayton, Vorsitzender der National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Seminole County.“ Die Zeitung zitierte Rev. Valarie Houston, Pastorin der Allen Chapel AME Church, einer Anlaufstelle für Demonstranten, mit den Worten: „Sie waren für uns da“, nach einem Treffen mit CRS-Agenten am 20. März. Unabhängig davon erhielt Judicial Watch als Antwort auf eine Anfrage des Florida Sunshine Law an die Stadt Sanford auch eine Audioaufzeichnung eines „Gemeindetreffens“, das am 19. April 2012 in der Second Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Sanford stattfand Der Sturz von Sanfords Polizeichef Bill Lee wurde geplant, nachdem eine Gruppe von College-Studenten, die sich selbst „Dream Defenders“ nannten, den Eingang zur Polizeibehörde verbarrikadierte und forderte, dass Lee gefeuert wird. Laut Orlando Sentinel hatten DOJ-Mitarbeiter des CRS eine 40-Meilen-Polizeisekorte für die Studenten von Daytona Beach nach Sanford arrangiert. „Diese Dokumente beschreiben detailliert das außergewöhnliche Eingreifen des Justizministeriums in die Druckkampagne, die zur Anklage gegen George Zimmerman geführt hat“, sagte Tom Fitton, Präsident von Judicial Watch. „Meine Vermutung ist, dass die meisten Amerikaner es zu Recht ablehnen würden, wenn Steuerzahler Regierungsangestellte bezahlen, um bei der Organisation rassistisch motivierter Demonstrationen zu helfen.“	Das gemeinsame Unternehmensurteil des Gerichts könnte Ameen Jogee aus dem Gefängnis befreien	partially false

92e17268	Westliche Medien starteten kürzlich eine neue Runde von Angriffen auf Chinas Religionsfreiheit. Die großen religiösen Vereinigungen des Landes schlugen am Dienstag eine Initiative vor, in der gefordert wird, dass alle religiösen Stätten die chinesische Nationalflagge hissen, um das Bewusstsein für den Respekt vor der Flagge zu stärken und die Würde der Flagge zu wahren. Dieser Schritt wurde jedoch von einigen westlichen Medien als Versuch interpretiert, die ideologische Kontrolle des Landes über das religiöse Leben auszuweiten. Als die China Islamic Association vor über zwei Monaten Moscheen in China aufforderte, Nationalflaggen zu hissen, um den Patriotismus unter Muslimen zu fördern, beschuldigte der Westen China auch, seinen Griff auf die Religion zu verschärfen und in die Religionsfreiheit einzugreifen. Eine Nationalflagge ist ein Symbol des Landes, das von allen Bürgern respektiert werden sollte. Das Zeigen von Nationalflaggen ist nicht nur Anerkennung der nationalen Souveränität, sondern auch Ausdruck der Liebe zum Land. Das Aufhängen einer Fahne an religiösen Stätten soll das Konzept der Nation und das bürgerliche Bewusstsein religiöser Menschen stärken. Die Förderung des Patriotismus steht nicht im Widerspruch zum Schutz der Religionsfreiheit, der Islam zum Beispiel betont den Patriotismus als Teil des Glaubens. Für multiethnische und multireligiöse Länder wie China ist die Stärkung des nationalen und zivilgesellschaftlichen Bewusstseins der Menschen von besonderer Bedeutung. Kolonialisten teilten nationale Grenzen nach Nationalität und Religion auf, was zu schweren Konflikten mit asiatischen Ländern führte, wie im Fall von Indien und Pakistan. China muss daraus Lehren ziehen und seine Bemühungen verstärken, das nationale und bürgerliche Bewusstsein religiöser Menschen aufzubauen. Religionen sind exklusiv. Der Schlüssel zu einem harmonischen Zusammenleben besteht darin, ihre nationale Identität zu bewahren. Wenn das gemeinsame Gefühl der nationalen Identität zusammenbrach, würde das Land geteilt oder sogar in Richtung Krieg taumeln. Dank Chinas effektiver religiöser Führung haben sich die Religionen in China im Laufe der Jahre schnell entwickelt. Die chinesische Regierung übernimmt das Prinzip der Trennung von Religion und Politik und respektiert die Religionsfreiheit. Legale religiöse Aktivitäten sind in jeder Region Chinas nicht nur erlaubt, sondern auch gut geschützt. In dem Versuch, Chinas nationale Einheit zu spalten, haben viele westliche Kräfte jedoch wiederholt die Religionsfreiheit des Landes in Frage gestellt und grundlose Behauptungen aufgestellt, dass religiöse Gruppen in China unterdrückt würden. Wenn die amerikanische Flagge gehisst wird, erheben sich alle Amerikaner, unabhängig von Rasse oder Religion, um ihren Respekt zu zeigen. China hat allen Grund, die nationale Identität und das staatsbürgerliche Bewusstsein unter religiösen Menschen zu stärken. Das Hissen der Nationalflagge an religiösen Stätten ist eine gute Möglichkeit, dies zu tun. Ohne ein stabiles Land als Grundlage des religiösen Glaubens wird die Religion nur Spaltung verursachen.

347530a3	"Am Dienstag erklärte der Moderator der Radiosendung John Fredricks, dass mehrere Wähler in Georgia seine Sendung angerufen hätten, um ihm mitzuteilen, dass sie ihre Stimme bei der Stichwahl in Georgia nicht abgeben könnten, weil ihnen mitgeteilt wurde, dass die Wahlgeräte nicht richtig funktionierten. Die Anrufer behaupteten, die Wahlhelfer hätten ihnen gesagt, sie sollten ihre Stimmzettel in eine Schachtel werfen, und sie würden später am Tag gescannt. Denken Sie daran, dass die Fehlfunktionen Berichten zufolge in tiefroten Landkreisen auftraten. Die Kommentare von Fredricks kamen während eines Interviews mit Steve Bannon über War Room Pandemic. „Dominion-Maschinen in … 3 der größten republikanischen Bezirke … sind ausgefallen … Ihnen wird gesagt, dass sie ihre Stimmzettel nicht scannen können, weil die Maschinen nicht funktionieren … Die Polarbeiter sagen: ‚Wenn es repariert ist Wir scannen es für Sie. Es gibt alle möglichen roten Fahnen“, sagte Fredricks. Auch weitere Wähler auf Twitter schlugen Alarm. „Ich habe gerade in Newton County, Georgia, gewählt“, sagte ein Twitter-Nutzer. „Schwerer republikanischer Bezirk legte es in den Automatenschlitz, aber nicht in den Scanner.“ Der Wähler fügte später hinzu und twitterte: „UPDATE. Ich habe die Hotline von @GaRepublicans angerufen und der Typ sagte, dass sie bereits von dieser Art von Problemen hören!“
Ein Wähler in Sandy Springs im Fulton County sagte: „Gerade in der #Georgia-Stichwahl und natürlich im stark @GOP-Bezirk bei HeardsFerry – Sandy Springs #Dominion-Scanner „sind ausgefallen“.

Am vergangenen Mittwoch kamen der Justizunterausschuss des georgischen Senats für Wahlen sowie Mitglieder des Justizausschusses des Senats zusammen, um eine Anhörung zu den georgischen Wahlgesetzen abzuhalten. Während der Anhörung erklärte der Erfinder Jovan Pulitzer, dass er die Wahlergebnisse Georgiens leicht mit speziellen Techniken prüfen könne, die betrügerische Stimmzettel identifizieren würden. Pulitzer erklärte, dass er „keine Rücksicht auf den Rauch und die Spiegel der Funktionsweise der Maschinen“ habe und sich ausschließlich auf die Papierstimmzettel konzentrieren würde. „Mir ist die Maschine egal“, erklärte er. „Ich kümmere mich nicht einmal um den Code, der in die Maschine geschrieben wurde. Was mich interessiert, ist dieses physische Artefakt [Stimmzettel] und dieses physische Artefakt weist von Distrikt zu Distrikt wesentliche Unterschiede auf, die nicht vorhanden sein sollten.“ Pulitzer behauptete schockierend, er könne 500.000 in nur zwei Stunden analysieren.

3c8eac5c	TALLAHASSEE, Florida (WCTV) – Am Mittwoch unterzeichnete Präsident Joe Biden eine Durchführungsverordnung, um die Absicht der Vereinigten Staaten zum Ausdruck zu bringen, dem Pariser Klimaabkommen wieder beizutreten. Das 2016 unterzeichnete Pariser Klimaabkommen ist ein Abkommen innerhalb des Rahmenübereinkommens der Vereinten Nationen über Klimaänderungen. Das Abkommen befasst sich mit der Minderung, Anpassung und Finanzierung von Treibhausgasemissionen, um die globale Erwärmung zu begrenzen. Im Anschluss an diese Exekutivverordnung veröffentlichte der Senator von Florida, Rick Scott, die folgende Erklärung: Wir alle wollen uns um unsere Umwelt kümmern und sie für kommende Generationen schützen, aber wir müssen aufhören, uns Deals anzuschließen, die schlecht für Amerika sind. Präsident Biden wirft die USA zurück in das Pariser Abkommen, nur um seine liberalen Freunde zu besänftigen. Dieses Abkommen trägt nicht dazu bei, echte Umweltverschmutzer wie das kommunistische China und Indien zur Rechenschaft zu ziehen, und es bringt die amerikanischen Steuerzahler auf unfaire Weise an den Haken. Es war schlecht für Amerika, als Obama es unterzeichnete, und es ist immer noch schlecht. Präs. Biden stornierte außerdem die Keystone XL-Pipeline und befahl den Bundesbehörden, den Prozess zur Wiedereinführung von Umweltvorschriften einzuleiten, die unter Pres rückgängig gemacht wurden.

86955ba5	"Meiner Erfahrung nach wird gute öffentliche Ordnung am besten durch die leidenschaftslose Analyse dessen geprägt, was in der Praxis funktioniert hat oder nicht. Eine Politik, die auf gemeinsamen Annahmen und allgemeinen Gefühlen basiert, kann zu einem Rezept für falsche Rezepte und fehlgeleitete Interventionen werden. Nirgendwo wird diese Trennung zwischen Rhetorik und Realität deutlicher als bei der Formulierung der globalen Drogenpolitik, wo allzu oft Emotionen und Ideologie statt Beweise vorherrschen. Nehmen wir den Fall der medizinischen Verwendung von Cannabis. Wenn wir uns die Beweise aus den Vereinigten Staaten genau ansehen, wissen wir jetzt, dass die Legalisierung der Verwendung von Cannabis für medizinische Zwecke nicht, wie die Gegner argumentierten, zu einer Zunahme des Cannabiskonsums durch Teenager geführt hat. Im Gegensatz dazu gab es zwischen 2010 und 2013 fast eine Verdreifachung der amerikanischen Todesfälle durch Überdosierung von Heroin, obwohl das Gesetz und seine harten Strafen unverändert bleiben. In diesem Jahr wird die Generalversammlung der Vereinten Nationen zwischen dem 19. und 21. April eine Sondersitzung zum Thema Drogen abhalten, und die Welt wird die Chance haben, ihren Kurs zu ändern. Wenn wir uns diesem Ereignis nähern, müssen wir uns fragen, ob wir auf dem richtigen politischen Weg sind. Genauer gesagt, wie gehen wir mit dem um, was das Büro der Vereinten Nationen für Drogen- und Verbrechensbekämpfung als „unbeabsichtigte Folgen“ der Politik der letzten 50 Jahre bezeichnet hat, die unter anderem dazu beigetragen hat, einen riesigen internationalen kriminellen Markt zu schaffen Drogen, die Gewalt, Korruption und Instabilität schüren? Denken Sie nur an die 16.000 Morde in Mexiko im Jahr 2013, von denen viele direkt mit dem Drogenhandel in Verbindung stehen. Ein Krieg gegen die Menschen Weltweit hat der „Krieg gegen die Drogen“ keinen Erfolg. Einige schätzen, dass die Durchsetzung der weltweiten Prohibition mindestens 100 Milliarden US-Dollar (90,7 Milliarden Euro) pro Jahr kostet, aber mittlerweile konsumieren weltweit bis zu 300 Millionen Menschen Drogen und tragen zu einem globalen illegalen Markt mit einem Umsatz von 330 Milliarden US-Dollar pro Jahr bei, einem der größten Rohstoffmärkte der Welt. Die Prohibition hat sich kaum auf das Angebot oder die Nachfrage nach Drogen ausgewirkt. Wenn die Strafverfolgung in einem Bereich erfolgreich ist, verlagert sich die Drogenproduktion einfach in eine andere Region oder ein anderes Land, der Drogenhandel verlagert sich auf eine andere Route und Drogenkonsumenten wechseln zu einer anderen Droge. Auch das Verbot hat die Verwendung nicht wesentlich verringert. Studien konnten durchweg keinen Zusammenhang zwischen der Härte der Drogengesetze eines Landes und dem Ausmaß des Drogenkonsums nachweisen. Die weitverbreitete Kriminalisierung und Bestrafung von Drogenkonsumenten und die überfüllten Gefängnisse machen den Krieg gegen Drogen zu einem erheblichen Teil zu einem Krieg gegen Drogenkonsumenten, zu einem Krieg gegen Menschen. Afrika ist leider ein Beispiel für diese Probleme. Die Westafrika-Drogenkommission, die meine Stiftung einberufen hat, berichtete letztes Jahr, dass die Region inzwischen nicht nur zu einem wichtigen Transitpunkt zwischen Produzenten in Lateinamerika und Verbrauchern in Europa geworden ist, sondern auch zu einem Gebiet, in dem der Konsum zunimmt. Drogengeld und die damit verbundene Kriminalität fördern Korruption und Gewalt. Die Stabilität der Länder und der gesamten Region ist bedroht. Ich glaube, dass Drogen viele Leben zerstört haben, aber falsche Regierungspolitik hat noch viel mehr zerstört. Wir alle wollen unsere Familien vor den potenziellen Schäden durch Drogen schützen. Aber wenn unsere Kinder ein Drogenproblem entwickeln, möchten wir sicherlich, dass sie als behandlungsbedürftige Patienten behandelt und nicht als Kriminelle gebrandmarkt werden. Stoppen Sie die Stigmatisierung und beginnen Sie zu helfen Die Tendenz in vielen Teilen der Welt, Drogenkonsumenten zu stigmatisieren und einzusperren, hat viele davon abgehalten, eine medizinische Behandlung in Anspruch zu nehmen. In welchen anderen Bereichen der öffentlichen Gesundheit kriminalisieren wir hilfsbedürftige Patienten? Strafmaßnahmen haben viele Menschen ins Gefängnis gebracht, wo sich ihr Drogenkonsum verschlechtert hat. Eine Vorstrafe für einen Jugendlichen wegen eines geringfügigen Drogendelikts kann eine weitaus größere Bedrohung für sein Wohlbefinden darstellen als ein gelegentlicher Drogenkonsum. Die ursprüngliche Absicht der Drogenpolitik, so die UN-Suchtstoffkonvention, war der Schutz der ""Gesundheit und des Wohlergehens der Menschheit"". Wir müssen die internationale und nationale Politik auf dieses Schlüsselziel neu ausrichten. Dazu müssen wir vier entscheidende Schritte unternehmen. Erstens müssen wir den privaten Drogenkonsum entkriminalisieren. Der Konsum von Drogen ist schädlich, und die Verringerung dieser Schäden ist eine Aufgabe des öffentlichen Gesundheitssystems, nicht der Gerichte. Dies muss mit der Stärkung der Behandlungsdienste gekoppelt werden, insbesondere in Ländern mit mittlerem und niedrigem Einkommen. Zweitens müssen wir akzeptieren, dass eine drogenfreie Welt eine Illusion ist. Wir müssen uns stattdessen darauf konzentrieren sicherzustellen, dass Medikamente den geringstmöglichen Schaden anrichten. Maßnahmen zur Schadensminimierung, wie z. B. Nadelaustauschprogramme, können einen echten Unterschied machen. Deutschland hat solche Maßnahmen schon früh eingeführt, und die Rate der HIV-Infektionen unter injizierenden Drogenkonsumenten liegt bei fast 5 Prozent, verglichen mit über 40 Prozent in einigen Ländern, die sich diesem pragmatischen Ansatz widersetzen. Drittens müssen wir uns eher mit Regulierung und öffentlicher Aufklärung befassen als mit der totalen Unterdrückung von Drogen, von der wir wissen, dass sie nicht funktionieren wird. Die erfolgreich unternommenen Schritte zur Reduzierung des Tabakkonsums (einer sehr starken und schädlichen Sucht) zeigen, was erreicht werden kann. Es sind Regulierung und Aufklärung, nicht die Androhung von Gefängnis, die die Zahl der Raucher in vielen Ländern verringert haben. Höhere Steuern, Verkaufsbeschränkungen und wirksame Anti-Raucher-Kampagnen haben die richtigen Ergebnisse geliefert. Der legale Verkauf von Cannabis ist eine Realität, die damit begann, dass Kalifornien 1996 den Verkauf von Cannabis für medizinische Zwecke legalisierte. Seitdem sind 22 US-Bundesstaaten und einige europäische Länder diesem Beispiel gefolgt. Andere sind noch weiter gegangen. Eine Wählerinitiative, die an der Urne eine Mehrheit errungen hat, hat Colorado veranlasst, den Verkauf von Cannabis für den Freizeitgebrauch zu legalisieren. Im vergangenen Jahr hat Colorado rund 135 Millionen US-Dollar an Steuern und Lizenzgebühren im Zusammenhang mit legalen Cannabisverkäufen eingenommen. Andere haben weniger kommerzielle Wege eingeschlagen. Benutzer der spanischen Cannabis Social Clubs können Cannabis über kleine nichtkommerzielle Organisationen anbauen und kaufen. Und Kanada wird voraussichtlich nächstes Jahr das erste G7-Land sein, das den Verkauf von Cannabis reguliert. Gesetzliche Regulierung schützt die Gesundheit Erste Trends zeigen uns, dass dort, wo Cannabis legalisiert wurde, es keine Explosion des Drogenkonsums oder der Drogenkriminalität gegeben hat. Die Größe des Schwarzmarktes wurde reduziert und Tausenden von jungen Menschen wurden Vorstrafen erspart. Aber ein geregelter Markt ist kein freier Markt. Wir müssen sorgfältig überlegen, was reguliert werden muss und was nicht. Auch wenn der Konsum von Cannabis meist gelegentlich, moderat und nicht mit erheblichen Problemen verbunden ist, muss er dennoch gerade wegen seiner potenziellen Risiken reguliert werden. Und deshalb besteht der vierte und letzte Schritt darin, zu erkennen, dass Medikamente reguliert werden müssen, gerade weil sie riskant sind. Es ist an der Zeit anzuerkennen, dass Drogen unendlich gefährlicher sind, wenn sie ausschließlich in den Händen von Kriminellen bleiben, die sich keine Sorgen um Gesundheit und Sicherheit machen. Gesetzliche Regelungen schützen die Gesundheit. Die Verbraucher müssen sich darüber im Klaren sein, was sie einnehmen, und über klare Informationen zu Gesundheitsrisiken und deren Minimierung verfügen. Regierungen müssen in der Lage sein, Verkäufer und Verkaufsstellen danach zu regulieren, wie viel Schaden ein Medikament anrichten kann. Die riskantesten Medikamente sollten nie „frei verkäuflich“ erhältlich sein, sondern nur auf ärztliche Verschreibung für als abhängig Konsumierende registrierte Personen, wie es in der Schweiz bereits geschieht. Wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse und unsere Sorge um Gesundheit und Menschenrechte müssen die Drogenpolitik prägen. Das bedeutet, dafür zu sorgen, dass weniger Menschen an einer Überdosis Drogen sterben und dass Kleinstraftäter nicht im Gefängnis landen, wo sich ihre Drogenprobleme verschlimmern. Es ist Zeit für einen intelligenteren, gesundheitsbasierten Ansatz in der Drogenpolitik. Es ist an der Zeit, dass Länder wie Deutschland, die zu Hause eine bessere Politik verfolgen, sich nachdrücklich für einen Politikwechsel im Ausland einsetzen. Die Sondersitzung der Generalversammlung der Vereinten Nationen zum weltweiten Drogenproblem wäre ein guter Ausgangspunkt."

9a87dc93	Meine Tochter hätte wahrscheinlich nicht in einem System überlebt, in dem Bürokraten Innovation und Rationierung ersticken. Heute ist der erste Jahrestag des größten Einzelangriffs auf unsere Freiheit in meinem Leben: die Unterzeichnung von ObamaCare. Wenn wir darüber nachdenken, was dieses Gesetz unserem Land antun könnte, kann ich nicht umhin, über ein medizinisches Wunder nachzudenken, das durch das amerikanische Gesundheitssystem ermöglicht wurde. Es ist eines, das für mich eine besondere Bedeutung hat. Vor einigen Jahren kam ein kleines Mädchen mit einem schweren Herzfehler zur Welt: Aorta und Pulmonalarterie waren vertauscht. Ohne sofortiges Eingreifen hätte sie nicht überlebt. Das Kind wurde in ein anderes Krankenhaus gebracht, wo ein Chirurg um 1 Uhr morgens einen Eingriff durchführte, der ihr Leben rettete. Acht Monate später, als ihr Herz die Größe einer kleinen Pflaume hatte, wurde es von einem unglaublich engagierten und erfahrenen Team von Medizinern chirurgisch rekonstruiert. Siebenundzwanzig Jahre später ist die junge Frau nun Krankenschwester auf einer Neugeborenen-Intensivstation, wo sie ihre Ausbildung zur Krankenpflegerin absolviert. Sie wurde nicht von einem Bürokraten gerettet, und kein Regierungsauftrag zwang ihre Eltern, die Versicherung zu kaufen, die sie gerettet hatte. Stattdessen wurde ihre Pflege im Rahmen eines gewöhnlichen Plans bereitgestellt, der jedem Mitarbeiter einer Kunststofffabrik in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, zur Verfügung stand. Wenn Sie es nicht erraten haben, diese Geschichte berührt mein Herz, weil das Mädchen meine Tochter Carey ist. Und meine Frau und ich sind unglaublich dankbar, dass wir die Freiheit hatten, nach der fortschrittlichsten Operationstechnik zu suchen.

Und wenn Außenminister wie ich Betrugsfälle aufdecken, wird uns gesagt, dass die Zahl der Fälle von Wahlbetrug zu unbedeutend ist, um eine Rolle zu spielen. Jetzt sind jedoch Fakten ans Licht gekommen, die darauf hindeuten, dass eine entscheidende, knappe Wahl am 8. November 2016 wahrscheinlich durch Wahlbetrug verändert wurde: New Hampshires Sitz im US-Senat und vielleicht auch New Hampshires vier Wahlkollegiumsstimmen bei der Präsidentschaftswahl. New Hampshire ist einer von fünfzehn Bundesstaaten, die die Wählerregistrierung am selben Tag zulassen. Der Vorteil der Registrierung am selben Tag besteht darin, dass eine Person, die die Registrierung verschoben oder vergessen hat, am Wahltag trotzdem eine Stimme abgeben kann. Der Nachteil der Registrierung am selben Tag besteht darin, dass der Staat keine Zeit hat, die Wahlberechtigung des Wählers zu beurteilen. Ein freiwilliger Wahlhelfer akzeptiert einfach ein Mindestmaß an Identifikation und nimmt den Wähler beim Wort, dass er ein in dem Staat ansässiger US-Bürger ist, der wahlberechtigt ist. New Hampshire ist auch ein Schlachtfeldstaat. Im Gegensatz zu den Nachbarländern Massachusetts und Vermont, die bei den Präsidentschaftswahlen zuverlässig für die Demokraten stimmen, kann New Hampshire in beide Richtungen schwingen. Es wird seit langem anekdotisch berichtet, dass Out-of-States die Registrierung am selben Tag in New Hampshire ausnutzen und in den Granite State reisen, um betrügerische Stimmen abzugeben. Jetzt gibt es den Beweis. Laut Statistiken, die vom Sprecher des Repräsentantenhauses von New Hampshire veröffentlicht wurden, gab es am Tag der allgemeinen Wahlen im November 2016 6.540 Registranten, die sich am selben Tag in New Hampshire registrierten, um mit einem ausländischen Führerschein zu wählen beweisen ihre Identität. An sich beweist das nicht, dass ein Betrug stattgefunden hat – theoretisch könnte jede dieser Personen jemand gewesen sein, der kürzlich in den Staat gezogen ist und noch keine Zeit hatte, einen New Hampshire-Führerschein zu machen. Nach dem Gesetz von New Hampshire hat ein neuer Einwohner 60 Tage Zeit, um einen New Hampshire-Führerschein zu erhalten. Wenn also diese 6.540 Wähler echte Einwohner von New Hampshire wären, würden sie ihren Führerschein spätestens am 7. Januar 2017 erhalten. Die Zahlen sprechen jedoch eine ganz andere Geschichte. Es stellt sich heraus, dass bis zum 30. August 2017 – fast zehn Monate nach der Wahl – nur 1.014 der 6.540 am selben Tag registrierten Personen, die sich mit einer nichtstaatlichen Lizenz registriert hatten, einen New Hampshire-Führerschein erhalten hatten. Die anderen 5.526 Personen haben nie einen Führerschein aus New Hampshire erhalten. Und von diesen 5.526 registrierten nur 213 ein Fahrzeug in New Hampshire. 5.313 dieser Wähler haben also weder einen New Hampshire-Führerschein erhalten noch ein Fahrzeug in New Hampshire zugelassen. Sie haben die gesetzlichen Anforderungen für Einwohner in Bezug auf Führerscheine nicht befolgt, und es scheint, dass sie nicht wirklich in New Hampshire wohnen. Es scheint, dass sie nie echte Einwohner des Staates waren. 5.513 ist eine große Zahl – mehr als genug, um zwei sehr wichtige Wahlen zu führen. Die nächste große Wahl war der Wettbewerb zwischen der amtierenden republikanischen US-Senatorin Kelly Ayotte und der Herausforderin Maggie Hassan (D). Hassan gewann die Wahl mit einem hauchdünnen Vorsprung von 1.017 Stimmen. Diese 5.313 betrügerischen Stimmen waren mehr als genug, um die Wahl zu beeinflussen. Wenn sich 59,2 Prozent oder mehr von ihnen für Hassan entschieden, dann wurde die Wahl durch Wahlbetrug gestohlen. Das ist wahrscheinlich, da die umliegenden Staaten Hochburgen der Demokraten sind. Es ist auch möglich, dass die vier Stimmen des Wahlkollegiums von New Hampshire durch illegale Stimmabgabe von Nichtansässigen an Hillary Clinton weitergegeben wurden. Clinton gewann New Hampshire mit nur 2.732 Stimmen. Wenn 74,8 Prozent der 5.513 Falschstimmen für Clinton abgegeben wurden, dann war auch die Präsidentschaftswahl in New Hampshire ein Tipp. Wenn der Präsidentschaftswahlkampf enger gewesen wäre und auf einen Vorsprung von drei oder vier Stimmen des Wahlkollegiums hinausgegangen wäre, hätte dieser Wahlbetrug möglicherweise außergewöhnliche Folgen gehabt. Unabhängig davon ist es im Senatswettbewerb sehr wahrscheinlich, dass die Stimmabgabe von Nichtansässigen das Ergebnis verändert hat. Und das hat bereits Folgen für die Nation. Wenn das Verhältnis von 52 zu 48 zwischen Republikanern und Demokraten im Senat 53 zu 47 wäre, könnte dies das Gleichgewicht bei einer beliebigen Anzahl von Stimmen verändern – nicht zuletzt durch die Bemühungen, Obamacare aufzuheben. Aber die Mainstream-Medien werden uns sagen: „Geh weiter, hier gibt es nichts zu sehen.“ Kris W. Kobach ist der gewählte Außenminister von Kansas.

00d55f13	Im Gegensatz zu Beschwerden vieler Nigerianer hat die Präsidentschaft erklärt, dass die Preise für Lebensmittel im ganzen Land sinken. Im Namen der Präsidentschaft sagte Herr Garba Shehu, dass der deutliche Rückgang der Lebensmittelpreise auf die Reformen von Präsident Muhammadu Buhari im Agrarsektor zurückzuführen sei. Herr Shehu, der am Freitag zu Gast bei Sunrise Daily von Channels Television war, sagte, dass die Preise zwar je nach Bundesstaat und Region unterschiedlich sein könnten, aber im Allgemeinen gibt es einen Preisverfall bei Lebensmitteln.

Er sagte: „Nigerianer müssen die Tatsache berücksichtigen, dass die Direktive des Präsidenten an das CBN von nichts anderem als einem patriotischen Motiv angetrieben wird.“ Laut Herrn Shehu steht diese Richtlinie im Einklang mit dem Bestreben des Präsidenten, die Landwirtschaft im Land anzukurbeln, eine Position, mit der einige Personen nicht einverstanden sind, da sie argumentieren, dass die Politik des CBN nicht von einer politischen Autorität aufgezwungen werden sollte. An diejenigen gerichtet, die der Ansicht sind, dass die Richtlinie von Buhari übertrieben ist, sagte Herr Shehu: „Ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob die Zentralbank irgendwo auf der Welt so unabhängig ist, dass sie als ausländisches Eigentum operieren wird.“	SB-350 Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act von 2015.	false
c57f8234	"Menschen mit Lungenkrebs sterben, nachdem sie spät in der Notaufnahme diagnostiziert wurden, weil ihr Hausarzt trotz oft wiederholter Besuche Anzeichen der Krankheit übersehen hat, haben Experten enthüllt. Laut einem Bericht der UK Lung Cancer Coalition werden in einigen Teilen Englands bis zu 56 % der Menschen, die an Lungenkrebs erkranken, erst diagnostiziert, wenn sie die Notaufnahme aufsuchen. Es ist fünfmal wahrscheinlicher, dass sie innerhalb eines Jahres sterben als diejenigen, deren Zustand entweder von ihrem Hausarzt oder durch das NHS-Krebsvorsorgeprogramm festgestellt wurde. Hausärzte diagnostizieren Fälle von Lungenkrebs oft erst, wenn es zu spät für eine wirksame Behandlung ist, oder übersehen sie ganz, was dazu führt, dass Patienten Hilfe bei der Notaufnahme suchen, heißt es in dem Bericht. Mehr als ein Drittel der Lungenkrebspatienten suchen ihren Hausarzt dreimal oder öfter auf, bevor sie zu Untersuchungen überwiesen werden. Dies ist ein Schlüsselfaktor für die im internationalen Vergleich schlechte Bilanz des Vereinigten Königreichs bei der Früherkennung der Krankheit. Lungenkrebs ist die dritthäufigste Krebsart im Vereinigten Königreich und der größte Krebskiller, der jährlich 35.000 Todesopfer fordert. „Menschen, die in der Notaufnahme diagnostiziert wurden, sterben aufgrund von Verzögerungen bei der Identifizierung ihrer Krankheit. Eine späte Diagnose erschwert die Behandlung von Lungenkrebs und ist ein Hauptgrund dafür, dass wir in Großbritannien ein so schlechtes Überleben haben“, sagte Prof. Mick Peake, Vorsitzender der klinischen Beratungsgruppe der Koalition. Es sei „eine Farce“, dass die Krankenhauseinweisung als medizinischer Notfall die häufigste Art der Diagnose der Krankheit sei, fügte Peake hinzu, der auch klinischer Direktor des Centre for Cancer Outcomes am University College Hospital London ist. Das Versäumnis der Hausärzte, Symptome von Lungenkrebs zu erkennen, sei nur ein Grund für Großbritanniens geringe Früherkennungsrate und hohe Sterblichkeitsrate bei Lungenkrebs, betonte Peake. Er fügte jedoch hinzu: „Es gibt gute Beweise dafür, dass Gelegenheiten für eine frühere Diagnose in der Grundversorgung verpasst werden, und wir fordern die Allgemeinmediziner dringend auf, bei Patienten mit Verdacht auf eine Lunge eine niedrige Schwelle für die Durchführung einer Röntgenaufnahme des Brustkorbs oder eines CT-Scans zu haben Krebs."" Die Zurückhaltung der Patienten, Symptome wie anhaltenden Husten untersuchen zu lassen, kann die Diagnose ebenfalls verzögern, insbesondere bei Patienten aus ärmeren Haushalten und älteren Menschen. Von Peake zitierte NHS-Daten zeigen eine Postleitzahlenlotterie, bei der Tower Hamlets im Osten Londons den höchsten Anteil an Patienten hat, deren Krankheit in A & E diagnostiziert wird – 56,2 % – dicht gefolgt von Manchester 56,1 % und Leeds Süd und Ost 54 %. Mehr als 50 % der Patienten werden auch in der Notaufnahme in Salford, Hull, South Tyneside und Sunderland diagnostiziert. Im Gegensatz dazu werden nur 14,7 % der Patienten in Guildford und Waverley in Surrey auf diese Weise diagnostiziert, mit niedrigen Raten auch in Wokingham in Berkshire mit 15,7 % und Harrogate mit 16 %. Dr. Moira Fraser-Pearce, Direktorin für Politik, Kampagnen und Einfluss bei Macmillan Cancer Support, sagte, dass Personalmangel in den NHS-Krebsdiensten und eine hohe Arbeitsbelastung die komplexen Gründe für das hohe Diagnoseniveau in der Notaufnahme verschärfen. Macmillan hat dem NHS England dabei geholfen, eine neue Methode zum Screening von Rauchern und anderen Hochrisikopatienten auf Lungenkrebs zu entwickeln, indem Tests in Lastwagen angeboten werden, die oft auf Parkplätzen von Supermärkten stehen. Der NHS äußerte sich nicht direkt zu den Ergebnissen, aber ein Sprecher sagte: „Der NHS fängt mehr Krebserkrankungen früher auf, wenn sie leichter zu behandeln sind, was zu Rekord-Überlebensraten bei Lungenkrebs führt.“ Gezielte Lungengesundheitschecks an Orten wie Supermarktparkplätzen werden „Tausende mehr Fälle von Krebs entdecken, die sonst möglicherweise nicht entdeckt worden wären, und noch mehr Leben retten“, fügten sie hinzu. NHS England hat sich verpflichtet, bis 2028 drei von vier Krebsfällen in einem frühen Stadium zu diagnostizieren. Derzeit werden 57 % der Lungenkrebserkrankungen spät diagnostiziert, was die Überlebenschancen stark verringert."	Ein Team von Wissenschaftlern aus Kanada hat mindestens 13 Cannabis-Sativa-Stämme identifiziert, von denen sie glauben, dass sie bei der Prävention und Behandlung von COVID-19 helfen können. Der Präsident der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika hat die letzten Wochen damit verbracht, ein gefährliches Medikament namens Hydroxychloroquin als prophylaktische Behandlung von COVID-19 anzupreisen. Leider liegt die Expertise des Präsidenten im Reality-TV, nicht in der Medizin. Mehrere Studien haben gezeigt, dass Hydroxychloroquin, ein Medikament zur Behandlung von Malaria, gefährliche Nebenwirkungen hat, wenn es zur Behandlung von Coronaviren verwendet wird, einschließlich Tod. Die Suche nach einem COVID-19-Medikament, das Donald Trump und seine Freunde in der Pharmaindustrie sowohl reich machen als auch die Menschen, die es nehmen, nicht töten wird, hat bisher keine Ergebnisse gebracht. Aber aufregende staatlich geförderte Forschungsergebnisse aus Kanada scheinen darauf hinzudeuten, dass ein anderer Ansatz angebracht ist. Laut der Forschungsarbeit des Teams: „Wir haben über 800 neue Cannabis-Sativa-Linien und -Extrakte entwickelt und die Hypothese aufgestellt, dass C.-Sativa-Extrakte mit hohem CBD-Gehalt verwendet werden können, um die ACE2-Expression in COVID-19-Zielgeweben zu modulieren. Beim Screening von C. sativa-Extrakten mit künstlichen menschlichen 3D-Modellen von Mund-, Atemwegs- und Darmgewebe identifizierten wir 13 C. sativa-Extrakte mit hohem CBD-Gehalt, die die ACE2-Genexpression und die ACE2-Proteinspiegel modulieren. Unsere ersten Daten deuten darauf hin, dass einige C. sativa-Extrakte die Serinprotease TMPRSS2 herunterregulieren, ein weiteres wichtiges Protein, das für den Eintritt von SARS-CoV2 in Wirtszellen erforderlich ist. Das bedeutet, dass das Team sorgfältig mehrere Cannabissorten entwickelt hat, von denen experimentell gezeigt wurde, dass sie es dem SARS-CoV2-Coronavirus erheblich erschweren, in den Gewebezellen, an die es sich anheftet, ein Zuhause zu finden, um uns mit dem COVID zu infizieren. 19 Krankheit. Das bedeutet nicht, dass Sie zu Ihrer örtlichen Apotheke laufen und deren Sativa- und CBD-Vorrat erschöpfen sollten. Die 13 von den Forschern kultivierten Stämme unterscheiden sich mit ziemlicher Sicherheit stark von den verrückt benannten Stämmen, die Sie rezeptfrei kaufen werden. Aber wenn Sie eine ungetestete Behandlung einnehmen müssen, empfehle ich, Kanadas Beispiel zu übernehmen und Cannabis legal zu sich zu nehmen, anstatt auf die Trump-Administration zu hören. Eine kürzlich von Mandeep Mehra, Professor an der Harvard Medical School, durchgeführte Studie, die Daten von mehr als 96.000 COVID-19-Patienten untersuchte, von denen 15.000 mit Hydroxychloroquin behandelt worden waren, zeigte deutlich, dass Patienten, die das Medikament einnahmen, einem weitaus höheren Sterberisiko ausgesetzt waren als diejenigen, die dies taten nicht. Laut einem Bericht der Washington Post: „Für diejenigen, denen Hydroxychloroquin verabreicht wurde, stieg das Sterblichkeitsrisiko um 34 Prozent und das Risiko für schwere Herzrhythmusstörungen um 137 Prozent. Für diejenigen, die Hydroxychloroquin und ein Antibiotikum – den von Trump befürworteten Cocktail – erhielten, bestand ein um 45 Prozent erhöhtes Sterberisiko und ein um 411 Prozent erhöhtes Risiko für schwere Herzrhythmusstörungen. Diejenigen, denen Chloroquin verabreicht wurde, hatten ein um 37 Prozent erhöhtes Sterberisiko und ein um 256 Prozent erhöhtes Risiko für schwere Herzrhythmusstörungen. Für diejenigen, die Chloroquin und ein Antibiotikum einnahmen, bestand ein um 37 Prozent erhöhtes Todesrisiko und ein um 301 Prozent erhöhtes Risiko für schwere Herzrhythmusstörungen. Donald Trump sagte kürzlich Reportern und der US-Öffentlichkeit, dass er Hydroxycholoroquin als vorbeugende Maßnahme zur Abwehr von COVID-19 eingenommen habe. Abgesehen von der Tatsache, dass er eine kleine finanzielle Beteiligung an Plaquenil – dem Medikamentennamen für Hydroxycholoroquin – hat, sollte er Cannabis einnehmen, wenn er COVID-19 wirklich vorbeugen will. Es gibt keine Peer-Review-Beweise dafür, dass es funktionieren wird, aber zumindest wird es ihn nicht umbringen. Nicht nur, dass noch nie jemand an der Einnahme von Cannabis gestorben ist, es hat auch klare medizinische Vorteile für die Prävention und Behandlung von Krankheiten, die von Virusinfektionen bis hin zu Krebs reichen. Das, und er wäre vielleicht weniger ein Arschloch, wenn er hin und wieder einen Joint rauchen würde. Weitere Informationen zur Cannabisstudie finden Sie hier im vollständigen Preprint-Forschungspapier. Und wenn Sie mehr darüber erfahren möchten, warum niemand Hydroxycholorquin zur Vorbeugung oder Behandlung von COVID-19 verwenden sollte, lesen Sie bitte diese wichtige Studie.	false
7d5ccffa	Die globalen Durchschnittstemperaturen über Land sind seit Mitte dieses Jahres um mehr als 1 °C gesunken – der größte und steilste Rückgang seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen. Die Nachricht kommt inmitten zunehmender Beweise dafür, dass die jüngste Serie von Weltrekordtemperaturen kurz vor dem Ende steht. Der Rückgang, der durch Nasa-Satellitenmessungen der unteren Atmosphäre aufgedeckt wurde, wurde durch das Ende von El Nino verursacht – die Erwärmung der Oberflächengewässer in einem weiten Gebiet des Pazifiks westlich von Mittelamerika. Die globalen Durchschnittstemperaturen über Land sind seit Mitte dieses Jahres um mehr als 1°C gesunken – der größte und steilste Rückgang seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen Einige Wissenschaftler, darunter Dr. Gavin Schmidt, Leiter der Klimaabteilung der Nasa, haben behauptet, dass die jüngsten Höchststände hauptsächlich auf langfristige globale Erwärmung. Andere haben argumentiert, dass die Rekorde durch El Nino verursacht wurden, ein komplexes Naturphänomen, das alle paar Jahre auftritt und nichts mit den Treibhausgasemissionen des Menschen zu tun hat. Der erneute Rückgang der Temperaturen legt nahe, dass sie Recht hatten. Große El Ninos haben immer einen immensen Einfluss auf das Weltwetter und verursachen über weite Teile der Welt höhere Temperaturen als normal. Der El Nino 2015-16 war wahrscheinlich der stärkste seit Beginn der genauen Messungen, wobei das Wasser bis zu 3 ° C wärmer als gewöhnlich war. Es wurde jetzt durch ein La Nina-Ereignis ersetzt – wenn das Wasser in derselben Pazifikregion kälter als normal wird. Letzte Woche sagte Mr. Trumps Wissenschaftsberater Bob Walker, er werde wahrscheinlich das Klimaforschungsbudget der Nasa in Höhe von 1,9 Milliarden US-Dollar (etwa 1,4 Milliarden Pfund) streichen. Dies hat auch weltweite Auswirkungen und treibt die Temperaturen eher nach unten als nach oben. Die Satellitenmessungen über Land reagieren schnell auf El Nino und La Nina. Die Temperaturen über dem Meer sinken ebenfalls, aber nicht so schnell, weil das Meer die Wärme länger speichert. Das bedeutet, dass 2016 nach einigen Maßstäben möglicherweise so heiß wie 2015 oder sogar etwas heißer erklärt wird – weil El Nino erst Mitte des Jahres verschwunden ist. Aber es ist fast sicher, dass im nächsten Jahr auch über den Ozeanen und von Wetterstationsthermometern auf der Oberfläche des Planeten große Wasserfälle gemessen werden – genau wie nach dem Ende des letzten sehr starken El Nino im Jahr 1998. Wenn ja, dann einige Experten werden gezwungen sein, ihre Worte zu essen. Im vergangenen Jahr sagte Dr. Schmidt, dass 2015 auch ohne El Nino ein rekordverdächtig heißes Jahr gewesen wäre. „Der Grund, warum dies ein so warmes Rekordjahr ist, liegt in dem langfristigen zugrunde liegenden Trend, dem kumulativen Effekt des langfristigen Erwärmungstrends unserer Erde“, sagte er. Dies wurde „hauptsächlich verursacht“ durch den Ausstoß von Treibhausgasen durch den Menschen. Dr. Schmidt bestritt auch, dass es zwischen den El Ninos von 1998 und 2015 eine „Pause“ oder „Hiatus“ in der globalen Erwärmung gegeben habe. Aber gestern stellte die Nasa auf ihrer Website-Startseite eine neue Studie vor, die besagte, dass es vor dem jüngsten El Nino eine Unterbrechung der globalen Erwärmung gab, und diskutierte, warum dies so war. Gestern Abend hatte Dr. Schmidt auf eine Bitte um Stellungnahme nicht reagiert. Allerdings könnten sowohl seine eigene Position als auch seine Nasa-Division in Gefahr sein. Der gewählte US-Präsident Donald Trump ist ein bekennender Skeptiker des Klimawandels, der einmal behauptete, es handele sich um einen von China erfundenen Schwindel. Letzte Woche sagte Mr. Trumps Wissenschaftsberater Bob Walker, er werde wahrscheinlich das Klimaforschungsbudget der Nasa in Höhe von 1,9 Milliarden US-Dollar (etwa 1,4 Milliarden Pfund) streichen. Die Erwärmung des Pazifiks kann Überschwemmungen auslösen, wie in Peru, wie oben abgebildet. Andere Experten haben Dr. Schmidts Behauptungen ebenfalls bestritten. Professor Judith Curry vom Georgia Institute of Technology und Präsidentin des Climate Forecast Applications Network sagte gestern: „Ich stimme Gavin nicht zu. Die Rekordwärmejahre 2015 und 2016 wurden hauptsächlich durch den Super-El Nino verursacht.“ Die Verlangsamung der Erwärmung sei real, fügte sie hinzu, und alle Beweise deuteten darauf hin, dass die Rate der globalen Erwärmung seit 1998 viel langsamer gewesen sei als von vorhergesagt Computermodelle – etwa 1C pro Jahrhundert. David Whitehouse, ein Wissenschaftler, der mit Lord Lawsons skeptischer Global Warming Policy Foundation zusammenarbeitet, sagte, der massive Rückgang der Temperaturen nach dem Ende von El Nino bedeute, dass die Erwärmungspause oder -verlangsamung möglicherweise zurückkehren werde. „Den Satelliten zufolge kehren die Temperaturen Ende 2016 auf das Niveau zurück, das sie nach dem El Nino von 1998 hatten.

2855fe5a	"TIJUANA, Mexiko – Es ist das Bild von der sich entfaltenden Krise in Tijuana, das auf der ganzen Welt zu sehen ist: eine Migrantenmutter und ihre kleinen Kinder, die vor einem rauchenden Tränengaskanister mit Stacheldraht und einer abweisenden Metallwand im Hintergrund davonlaufen. Beide Kinder sind nur mit T-Shirts bekleidet, eines scheint eine Pull-up-Windel zu tragen. Ein Kind ist barfuß, ein anderes trägt Flip-Flops. Die Frau, die ihre Arme umklammert und sie aus der Gefahrenzone zerrt, trägt schwarze Leggings und ein T-Shirt, auf dem die lächelnden Cartoon-Gesichter von Anna und Elsa aus dem Disney-Film „Frozen“ prangen. Dieses erschütternde Porträt wurde am Sonntag von der erfahrenen Reuters-Fotografin Kim Kyung-Hoon vor der Kamera festgehalten, kurz nachdem sich eine Gruppe zentralamerikanischer Migranten dem Grenzübergang nach San Diego näherte und von Tränengaskanistern zurückgedrängt wurde, die von US-Grenzagenten geschleudert wurden. „Als das Tränengas eingesetzt wurde, haben einige Leute geschrien und alle sind weggelaufen“, sagte Kim am Montag gegenüber NBC News. „Ich habe die Frau und zwei Kinder weglaufen sehen. Ein Mädchen war von Anfang an barfuß. Die andere trug Strandsandalen und verlor sie im Chaos.“ NBC News spürte auch die Frau, Maria Mesa, eine 39-jährige Mutter von fünf Kindern aus Honduras, in einem Zelt im Benito Juarez Shelter in Tijuana auf. „Ich Ich habe meine Kinder gepackt und bin weggelaufen“, sagte Mesa über ihre 5-jährigen Zwillingstöchter Saira und Sheilly. Mesa sagte, ihr 3-jähriger Sohn James, der nicht auf dem Bild zu sehen ist, sei auch bei ihnen und sei ohnmächtig geworden, nachdem er einen bekommen habe „Einer von ihnen hätte sterben können"", sagte sie. Kim sagte, Mesa „war mit fünf Kindern unterwegs.“ „Ihr Vater lebt in Louisiana und sie versuchen, ihn zu erreichen"", sagte er. Kims Foto, die auf der Website von NBC News und auf den Titelseiten zahlreicher Zeitungen erschien, provozierte weltweite Empörung und schien die Behauptung von Präsident Donald Trump zu lügen, die Karawanen seien eine Invasionstruppe von „Kriminellen“ und „Gangmitgliedern“. Migranten mit Tränengas beschimpfen und sie „einige sehr harte Leute“ nennen Mexiko sollte die Flagge wavi bewegen ng Migranten, von denen viele eiskalte Kriminelle sind, zurück in ihre Länder.

Kongress, finanziert die WALL! – Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 26. November 2018 Kim, ein 44-jähriger Südkoreaner mit Sitz in Tokio, ist Tragödien nicht fremd. In den 16 Jahren, in denen er für Reuters gearbeitet hat, hat er von Flugzeugabstürzen bis zum Erdbeben und Tsunami von 2011, die Japan verwüsteten, alles abgedeckt. Der letzte Auftrag begann für Kim am 14. November, als er in Mexiko-Stadt ankam und begann, den Migrantenkarawanen zu folgen, die dem Terror in den Heimatländern entkamen und nach Norden zur amerikanischen Grenze aufbrachen. Am Sonntag war die Gruppe, die Kim beschattet hatte, am Grenzübergang El Chaparral und die USA waren in Sicht. Der Reuters-Fotograf Kim Kyung-Hoon arbeitet am 11. April 2011 in Minamisoma, Japan. Minamisoma ist eine Stadt, die 11 Meilen vom Kernkraftwerk Fukushima entfernt ist, das von einem Erdbeben und Tsunami heimgesucht wurde. Kim Kyung-Hoon / Akte Reuters „Sie wurden an einer Stelle von der mexikanischen Polizei angehalten“, sagte der Fotograf. „Dann kletterten sie das Flussufer hinunter. Der Drahtzaun war auf der anderen Seite des Flusses etwa 20 Meter entfernt.“ Kim sagte, er habe beobachtet, wie die Mutter und die Zwillinge anfingen, den seichten Fluss an der Grenze zu durchqueren. Auf die Frage, ob die Mädchen deshalb so gut wie nichts trugen, sagte der Fotograf, er glaube, dass dies die gesamte Kleidung sei, die sie hätten. Für ein paar Sekunden, sagte Kim, wurde er von zwei Männern abgelenkt, die es bereits geschafft hatten und mit bloßen Händen und einem Eimer ein Loch unter einem Zaun gruben, damit sie darunter kriechen konnten. Dann war die Luft plötzlich von erstickendem Rauch erfüllt. „Ein Kanister fiel bei der Familie herunter und sie rannten weg“, sagte er und bezog sich auf die Mutter und die Zwillinge. Migranten fahren am 20. November auf der Ladefläche eines Lastwagens von Mexicali, Mexiko, nach Tijuana. Kim Kyung-Hoon / Reuters Kim sagte, er habe die kleinen Mädchen husten und weinen hören und er habe sofort seine Kamera in ihre Richtung gerichtet und beginnen, das sich entfaltende Chaos zu fotografieren. Er sagte, er sei bei ihnen geblieben, als sie zurück in das Migrantenlager flohen. Auf die Frage, ob er von dem, was er gesehen habe, und den herzzerreißenden Geräuschen weinender Kinder erschüttert sei, sagte Kim: „Meine Aufgabe ist es, zu dokumentieren, was passiert.“ „Ich versuche, meine Emotionen nicht in meine Arbeit einfließen zu lassen“, sagte er. KORREKTUR (27. November 2018, 7:50 Uhr): Eine frühere Version dieses Artikels hat die Kinder auf dem Foto falsch beschrieben. Ein Kind trug Sandalen; sie waren nicht beide barfuß. Gabe Gutierrez berichtete aus Tijuana und Corky Siemaszko aus New York City."	In den Kommentaren begann heute eine Diskussion über die „schwarzen Lungen der Raucher“. Es ist der weit verbreitete Glaube, dass die Lungen von Rauchern schwarz werden. Rose wies darauf hin, dass alles vor etwa vierhundert Jahren mit Jakob I. begann. Sie grub auch einige Widerlegungen aus: „Dr. Duane Carr – Professor für Chirurgie am College of Medicine der University of Tennessee, sagte dazu: „Rauchen verfärbt die Lunge nicht.“ (Link) Dr. Victor Buhler, Pathologe am St. Joseph Hospital in Kansas City: „Ich habe Tausende von Lungen sowohl grob als auch mikroskopisch untersucht. Ich kann Ihnen anhand der Untersuchung einer Lunge nicht sagen, ob ihr ehemaliger Wirt geraucht hat oder nicht.“ (Link) Dr. Sheldon Sommers, Pathologe und Laborleiter am Lenox Hill Hospital in New York: „… es ist grob oder mikroskopisch oder auf andere mir bekannte Weise nicht möglich, zwischen der Lunge eines Rauchers oder einer Raucherlunge zu unterscheiden ein Nichtraucher. Die Lungenschwärzung kommt von Kohlenstoffpartikeln, und das Rauchen von Tabak bringt keine Kohlenstoffpartikel in die Lunge.“ (link) Und Brigitte hat sogar ein Youtube-Video gefunden: Da gibt es sogar dieses, in dem ein Gerichtsmediziner behauptet, dass diese „Teer“-Lungen nicht existieren. Rich White's Smoke Screens berichtet dasselbe: Dies wurde von Dr. Jan Zeldenrust, einem holländischen Pathologen für die niederländische Regierung von 1951 – 1984, bestätigt. In einem Fernsehinterview in den 1980er Jahren erklärte er, aus dem Niederländischen übersetzt: „Ich konnte nie weiter sehen ein Paar Lungenflügel, wenn sie einem Raucher oder Nichtraucher gehörten. Ich kann deutlich den Unterschied zwischen kranken und gesunden Lungen sehen. Die einzigen schwarzen Lungen, die ich gesehen habe, stammen von Torfarbeitern und Bergarbeitern, niemals von Rauchern.“ smokers-lungs1Dennoch sind die schwarzen Lungen heutzutage überall auf Zigarettenschachteln zu finden. Und die schwarze Lungenkrankheit (oder Pneumokoniose) ist eine echte Krankheit. Kohlebergleute bekommen es. Woher kommt also die Idee der schwarzen Lunge der Raucher? Ein Teil der Antwort findet sich in einem Fotoessay auf Medicinenet: Dieser Fotoessay konzentriert sich auf die Raucherlunge. Der Begriff „Raucherlunge“ bezeichnet die durch das Zigarettenrauchen verursachten strukturellen und funktionellen Anomalien (Erkrankungen) der Lunge. Zuerst werden die normale Struktur und Funktion der Lunge beschrieben und veranschaulicht. Anschließend werden die durch das Rauchen verursachten strukturellen und funktionellen Anomalien beschrieben und illustriert. Etwas weiter unten wird die Wirkung des Emphysems auf die Lungen beschrieben. Emphysem Infolgedessen stört ein Emphysem auch die normale Blutversorgung. Abbildung 4 kontrastiert das unangenehme Aussehen einer emphysematösen Lunge eines Rauchers mit einer normalen Lunge. Es ist also ein Emphysem, das das unangenehme Aussehen einer emphysematösen Lunge eines Rauchers verursacht. Weiter geht es: Wie Sie sich vorstellen können, enthält Zigarettenrauch viele Verunreinigungen, die in großer Zahl direkt in die Lunge eingeatmet werden. Aus diesem Grund enthalten die Alveolarräume des Rauchers zahlreiche Fresszellen (Makrophagen), die mit verschlungenen (phagozytierten) Partikeln von Verunreinigungen und Ablagerungen gefüllt sind, wie in Abbildung 5 dargestellt. Unter dem Mikroskop können Sie bei dieser starken Vergrößerung tatsächlich sehen die schwarz und braun verschlungenen Partikel in den alveolären Fresszellen. Tatsächlich kann die Lunge eines Rauchers so viel von diesem Partikelmaterial enthalten, dass die Lunge mit bloßem Auge grau-schwarz aussieht. Meistens braucht man also kein Mikroskop, um festzustellen, ob jemand starker Raucher ist oder war. Eine Untersuchung der Lunge eines Rauchers mit bloßem Auge zeigt normalerweise eine vergrößerte grau-schwarze Lunge mit vergrößerten Lufträumen (das Emphysem, wie Sie in Abbildung 4 gesehen haben und in Abbildung 8 wieder sehen werden). Ich bin mir nicht sicher, warum die Leute gebeten werden, sich vorzustellen, was im Tabakrauch enthalten ist. Aber da die emphysematöse Lunge einfach in „Raucherlunge“ umbenannt wurde, muss vielleicht erklärt werden, warum sie grau-schwarz geworden ist. Und es ist dieses imaginäre Zeug im Tabakrauch, das heraufbeschworen wird, um es zu erklären. Die Lüge hängt davon ab, dass erstens behauptet wird, dass Rauchen ein Emphysem verursacht (das kann es tun oder auch nicht), und zweitens behauptet wird, dass ein Emphysem die Lungen grau-schwarz färbt (wahrscheinlich tut es das), und dann schließlich der verbindende Mittelbegriff „Emphysem“ fallen gelassen wird. und behaupten, dass das Rauchen die Lunge grau-schwarz färbt. Oder es nennt emphysematöse Lungen einfach „Raucherlungen“. Eine parallele falsche Zuschreibung könnte an anderer Stelle gefunden werden. Menschen, die Delhi besuchen, können durch die Aufnahme von Bakterien eine Lebensmittelvergiftung bekommen. Die Lebensmittelvergiftung kann Erbrechen und so weiter verursachen. Aber wenn die Verbindung „Bakterien“ übersehen wird und die Krankheit nur „Delhi-Bauch“ genannt wird (wie es oft der Fall ist), kann dies die Menschen dazu verleiten zu glauben, dass der Besuch in Delhi (oder indischen Restaurants) die Ursache des Problems ist – obwohl die meisten Besucher Delhis (und indischer Restaurants) tatsächlich nicht unter solchen negativen Auswirkungen leiden, und es neben Delhi noch viele andere Orte auf der Welt gibt, an denen Sie sich mit dem „Delhi-Bauch“ infizieren können. Es ist eine durch und durch unehrliche und anrüchige Fehlzuschreibung einer Krankheit. Es ordnet die Krankheit einer bestimmten sozialen Gruppe zu: Rauchern. Und es macht es zu ihrer Krankheit und niemandem sonst – obwohl nicht jeder, der ein Emphysem bekommt, ein Raucher ist und nicht alle Raucher ein Emphysem bekommen. Aber zumindest können wir jetzt sehen, warum Pathologen keine grauschwarzen Raucherlungen finden: Sie hatten kein Emphysem. Aber dies scheint nicht die einzige Art und Weise zu sein, wie die schwarze Lungenlüge verbreitet wird. Es gibt auch die Schweinelungen, die bei Demonstrationen verwendet werden. Ich habe sogar eine Anzeige für eine gefunden: Der begleitende Text erklärt hilfreich: Die aufblasbaren Schweinelungen wurden realistisch gefärbt und dann durch das geruchlose, ungiftige BioFlex-Verfahren speziell konserviert, das die Textur und Elastizität frischer Lungen behält. Die Lungen demonstrieren auf dramatische und unvergessliche Weise die Auswirkungen des langen Rauchens. Ein tastbarer simulierter innerer Tumor und ein physisch simulierter äußerer Tumor ermutigen die Schüler, die Textur der Lunge zu fühlen und sich daran zu erinnern, dass Rauchen eine bekannte Ursache für Lungenkrebs ist. Also erstens sind sie Schweinelungen. Und zweitens wurden sie konserviert und realistisch eingefärbt. Und simulierte innere und äußere Tumore wurden hinzugefügt. Und das alles, um die Auswirkungen des längeren Rauchens zu demonstrieren! Es ist unglaublich. Zweifellos wird den Schülern nichts davon gesagt und sie werden dazu gebracht zu glauben, dass sie echte menschliche „Raucherlungen“ betrachten. Es gibt sogar Diskussionen über die Wirksamkeit solcher Bilder. Marketingforscher der University of Arkansas, der Villanova University und der Marquette University befragten mehr als 500 US-amerikanische und kanadische Raucher und fanden heraus, dass die sehr anschaulichen Bilder der negativen Folgen des Rauchens den größten Einfluss auf die Absichten der Raucher haben, mit dem Rauchen aufzuhören. Die anschaulichsten Bilder, etwa solche, die schwere Mundkrankheiten zeigen, darunter entstelltes, geschwärztes und krebsartiges Gewebe, weckten Angst vor den Folgen des Rauchens und beeinflussten somit die Absicht der Verbraucher, mit dem Rauchen aufzuhören. „Diese Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass die Absicht, mit der Verwendung extrem anschaulicher bildlicher Darstellungen der negativen gesundheitlichen Folgen des Rauchens aufzuhören, wenig Nachteile zu haben scheint“, sagte Scot Burton, Co-Autor der Studie und Marketing-Professor am Sam M. Walton Hochschule der Wirtschaft. Tatsächlich kann die Verwendung solcher Grafiken einen Nachteil haben, wenn sie auf betrügerische Weise erlangt wurden (eine Überlegung, die den Marketingforschern nicht in den Sinn gekommen zu sein scheint). Und wir haben gerade zwei Methoden entwickelt, mit denen sie auf betrügerische Weise erlangt werden. Und der Nachteil ist, dass, wenn sich herausstellt, dass sie betrügerisch sind, die Personen, die sie veröffentlichen, des Betrugs, der Verdrehung der Logik und der Herstellung von Beweisen beschuldigt werden. Und wenn das passiert, werden die Leute aufhören, nicht nur den betrügerischen Beweisen zu glauben, die sie vorgelegt haben, sondern auch alles andere, was sie behaupten. Sie werden all ihre Glaubwürdigkeit verlieren. Niemand wird ihnen ein Wort glauben. Das ist ein ziemlich großer Nachteil, finde ich. Und es ist ein Nachteil, der ihnen nicht einmal in den Sinn gekommen zu sein scheint. Den Massenmedien, die zur Verbreitung dieser Lügen beitragen, scheint es nicht in den Sinn gekommen zu sein, dass die Menschen auch aufhören werden, ein Wort zu glauben, das sie sagen. Auch scheint es der Ärzteschaft, die diese Lügen unwidersprochen propagieren lässt, nicht eingefallen zu sein, dass die Menschen ihnen auch nicht mehr glauben werden. Es gibt eine Menge Nachteile, die darauf warten, unterzugehen.	true

Michelle Obama besuchte die Filmproduktion, während sie in der Nähe war, und Julia Roberts erklärte sich bereit, sie zu treffen, aber sie sprach über die Unterschiede zwischen Amerikas neuesten First Ladies, sobald Michelle das Set verließ. „Melania hat klare Prioritäten und ist ein großartiges Beispiel für unsere jungen Frauen“, sagte Julia Roberts. „Michelle? Sprechen Sie über einen Wolf im Schafspelz.“
Die Nachricht kommt Tage, nachdem Julia Roberts Celine Dion zugeschlagen hat, weil sie den POTUS kritisiert und erklärt hat, dass sie „Amerika hasst“. „Ich kann nicht einmal mehr auf eine amerikanische Flagge schauen. Ich hasse dieses Land“, sagte die Kanadierin Celine Dion, während sie sich über die Trump-Präsidentschaft beschwerte. „Du liegst falsch, Celine“, gab Julia Roberts zurück. „Das Amerika, das wir kennen und lieben, wurde von Obama und seiner katastrophalen Präsidentschaft zerstört. Wenn Sie nicht einverstanden sind, können Sie jederzeit in Ihr eigenes Land zurückkehren. Eigentlich sollten Sie das vielleicht wirklich tun.“ Celine Dion war eine von Dutzenden liberaler Prominenter, die damit „gedroht“ haben, die Vereinigten Staaten zu verlassen und in ihre Heimatländer zurückzukehren, wenn Amerika Donald Trump zum Präsidenten wählt. Bisher haben insgesamt null dieser liberalen Prominenten ihre Austrittsdrohungen wahr gemacht. Die schiere Heuchelei macht es schwer zu glauben, dass sie wirklich so stark fühlen, wie sie über Trump behaupten.

ccfaeb64	Laut den neuesten Zahlen zur Registrierung von Lebensmittelmarken des US-Landwirtschaftsministeriums (USDA) haben vier Millionen Menschen in einem Monat die Lebensmittelmarkenrollen abgegeben. Die neuesten USDA-Daten zeigen, dass die Zahl der Teilnehmer am Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), dem Regierungsprogramm, das Lebensmittelmarken verwaltet, von 45.666.795 im Oktober 2017 auf 41.658.868 im November 2017 gesunken ist – ein erstaunlicher Rückgang von 4.007.927 innerhalb eines Monats. Obwohl es einen vorübergehenden Anstieg der Einschreibungen gab, der sich hauptsächlich auf einige wenige Bundesstaaten konzentrierte, was zu einem Anstieg des nationalen Durchschnitts der Einschreibungen für Lebensmittelmarken führte, ist die landesweite Einschreibung in das Programm insgesamt immer noch rückläufig. Die Anmeldungen für das Programm stiegen im ersten Monat des Geschäftsjahres (GJ) 2018 (Oktober 2017) stark um 3,5 Millionen, was hauptsächlich auf die starke Zunahme der temporären SNAP-Anmeldungen in von Hurrikanen betroffenen Bundesstaaten wie Florida und Texas zurückzuführen ist. Allein in Florida stieg die Teilnahme an Lebensmittelmarken von September bis Oktober um 2,5 Millionen aufgrund der vom Staat gewährten Leistungen des Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) für arme Einwohner, die vom Hurrikan Irma betroffen waren. Der Food and Nutrition Service des USDA genehmigte den Antrag Floridas, diese speziellen D-SNAP-Vorteile ab dem 10. September 2017 zu verwalten. Ein Sprecher des Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) – das Programm, das die Vorteile von Lebensmittelmarken in Florida verwaltet – bestätigte dies gegenüber Breitbart News dass der dramatische Anstieg der SNAP-Einschreibungen im Staat auf die Katastrophenhilfe zurückzuführen war, die meisten Empfänger von Lebensmittelmarken jedoch keine normalen Begünstigten des Lebensmittelmarkenprogramms waren. „Der dramatische Anstieg der SNAP-Empfänger im Herbst stand im Zusammenhang mit der staatlichen Verwaltung des Katastrophen-SNAP-Programms des Bundes nach den Auswirkungen des Hurrikans Irma. Um sich für das Katastrophen-Ernährungsprogramm des Bundes zu qualifizieren, müssen Einzelpersonen am 5. September in einem der 48 erklärten Bezirke gelebt oder gearbeitet haben und NICHT Kunde des regulären Nahrungsmittelhilfeprogramms sein“, sagte DCF-Kommunikationsdirektorin Jessica Sims. Sims fügte hinzu, dass DCF in den Monaten nach dem Hurrikan Irma D-SNAP-Leistungen in Höhe von insgesamt mehr als 1 Milliarde US-Dollar an 3,1 Millionen Menschen verteilte, der Staat jedoch sein D-SNAP-Leistungsprogramm am 3. Dezember kürzte. Der starke Rückgang der Registrierung von Lebensmittelmarken über einen Monat spiegelt wider, wie Staaten wie Florida ihre vorübergehenden Lebensmittelmarken-Leistungsprogramme für die von Naturkatastrophen Betroffenen gekürzt haben. Es zeigt aber auch einen anhaltenden Abwärtstrend bei der Registrierung von Lebensmittelmarken, der seit mehreren Jahren anhält, seit die staatlichen Gesetzgeber Maßnahmen zur Sozialreform erlassen haben, die darauf abzielen, Menschen wieder in den Arbeitsmarkt zu bringen. Die Trump-Administration kündigte an, dass sie einige dieser Maßnahmen zur Reform des staatlichen Wohlfahrtswesens – wie die Verpflichtung von Lebensmittelmarkenempfängern, eine bestimmte Anzahl von Stunden pro Woche zu arbeiten – verabschieden und auf Bundesebene umsetzen werde, was dazu führen würde, dass die landesweite Registrierung von Lebensmittelmarken noch weiter sinkt. Im vergangenen Jahr, seit Präsident Donald Trump sein Amt angetreten hat, sind die Einschreibungen bei SNAP um zwei Millionen gesunken. Die neuesten Lebensmittelmarkenzahlen zeigen, dass sich der Abwärtstrend des vergangenen Jahres – und jedes Jahr nach 2013 – fortsetzt.

3552384d	"In Miami Beach hat der Stadtingenieur Bruce A. Mowry einen Plan zur Bekämpfung der Überschwemmungen entwickelt. Er reißt problematische Straßen auf, hebt sie mit zusätzlichem Schmutz auf und asphaltiert sie neu, installiert neue Abflüsse und riesige Pumpen, die Wasser zurück in die Bucht drücken können. Der Ansatz hat sich bereits in mehreren Quartieren bewährt. Es ist eine Kontroverse darüber ausgebrochen, ob Miami Beach die Biscayne Bay mit dem Wasser verschmutzt, aber die Stadt drängt weiter. Miami Beach plant, bis 2018 mindestens 400 Millionen US-Dollar für seinen Plan auszugeben und das Geld durch Gebühren aufzubringen, die Haushalten und Unternehmen auferlegt werden. Die riesige Bezirksregierung der Region, Miami-Dade County, entwickelt eine eigene Resilienzstrategie, die voraussichtlich Milliarden kosten wird. Sie hat sich verpflichtet, einen Teil ihrer maroden Infrastruktur, wie eine Kläranlage, so wieder aufzubauen, dass sie vor dem Anstieg des Meeresspiegels und Sturmfluten schützt. „Ich sehe hier keine Untergangsstimmung; Ich sehe Chancen“, sagte Harvey Ruvin, der Gerichtsschreiber des Bezirks Miami-Dade, der seit einem halben Jahrhundert eine führende Stimme für die Umwelt in Florida ist und kürzlich eine Task Force des Bezirks zum Anstieg des Meeresspiegels leitete. ""Wir sprechen über das robusteste mögliche Stellenprogramm, das Sie sich vorstellen können, und eines, das nicht ausgelagert werden kann."" Viele der republikanischen Bürgermeister in der Region sind auf der gleichen Seite wie die Demokraten, wenn es darum geht, nationale und staatliche Maßnahmen gegen den Klimawandel zu fordern und lokale Schritte voranzutreiben. James C. Cason, der republikanische Bürgermeister von Coral Gables, hat Informationsveranstaltungen einberufen, die Hunderte von Einwohnern anziehen, und er hat keine Beschwerden für seine Haltung erhalten. „Ich hoffe, dass die Bürger in den kommenden Jahren, wenn wir viel Geld ausgeben müssen, dies immer noch unterstützen werden“, sagte Herr Cason in einem Interview. Dennoch müssen seine Stadt und andere in Südflorida einige schwere Entscheidungen treffen. Einige Grundstückseigentümer können es sich nicht leisten, ihre Deiche zu erhöhen, wodurch ihre Nachbarschaft einem erhöhten Überschwemmungsrisiko ausgesetzt ist. Werden sie bei Überschwemmungen rechtlich zur Verantwortung gezogen? Eine strenge Politik könnte einige Menschen aus ihren Häusern zwingen.

64d89844	"COLUMBUS, Ohio – In diesem Juli wird Ohio mit der Verfolgung von Brandstiftern durch ein neues Register beginnen, das demjenigen ähnelt, das zur Verfolgung von Sexualstraftätern verwendet wird. Das Gesetz, das Ende letzten Jahres ohne große Aufmerksamkeit von der Generalversammlung von Ohio verabschiedet wurde, sieht vor, dass Personen, die wegen Straftaten im Zusammenhang mit Brandstiftung verurteilt wurden, sich jedes Jahr mindestens 10 Jahre lang beim Büro ihres örtlichen Sheriffs registrieren lassen müssen. Wer sich nicht anmeldet, wird strafrechtlich verfolgt. Befürworter preisen die Maßnahme als ein weiteres Instrument der Strafverfolgung bei der Untersuchung des schwer aufzuklärenden Verbrechens. Kritiker argumentieren jedoch, dass das Register belastend sein wird und dass Brandstiftung in Ohio kein Problem darstellt, das so groß ist, dass ein offizielles Register gerechtfertigt wäre, insbesondere eines, das vor den Augen der Öffentlichkeit verborgen bleibt. „Es gibt ein riesiges Problem mit Brandstiftung in Ohio“, sagte Senator Tim Schaffer, ein Republikaner aus Lancaster, der die Gesetzesvorlage gesponsert hat. Mit dem Register können die Strafverfolgungsbehörden „nachschlagen, wer alle verurteilten Brandstifter sind, die ihre Zeit abgeleistet haben und wieder zu Hause oder wieder in der Gemeinde sind. Die Chancen stehen gut, dass es sich um einen Wiederholungstäter handelt, und Sie wissen bereits, wer … es könnte sein."" Im vergangenen Jahr wurden 8.377 „verdächtige“ Brände gemeldet, die nach Angaben des Ohio State Fire Marshal zu einem geschätzten Schaden von mehr als 160 Millionen US-Dollar führten. Laut der Buckeye State Sheriff's Association gibt es jedes Jahr etwa 500 Verurteilungen wegen Brandstiftung. „Ich weiß nicht, woher es kam“, sagte Amy Borror, Sprecherin des Büros der Staatsverteidiger von Ohio, über das neue Gesetz. ""Ich weiß nicht, warum wir es haben."" Borror sagte, das Gesetz werde den örtlichen Sheriffs unnötige Arbeit auferlegen, die damit beauftragt werden, die Liste zusätzlich zu dem bereits zusammengestellten Register der Sexualstraftäter zusammenzustellen. „Das Register der Sexualstraftäter gibt es schon seit langer Zeit, und die Forschung, die da draußen ist, sagt, dass es keine positiven Auswirkungen auf die öffentliche Sicherheit hat“, sagte Borror. „Und wenn überhaupt, könnte es negative Auswirkungen auf die öffentliche Sicherheit haben, weil es diesen Verwaltungsaufwand verursacht.“ Nick Worner, Sprecher der American Civil Liberties Union, sagte, ein Register für Brandstiftung erscheine willkürlich und werde wenig zur Aufklärung von Verbrechen beitragen, da „das Zusammentreiben der üblichen Verdächtigen“ selten eine effektive Ermittlungsmethode sei. ""Werden wir irgendwann ein Register für alles haben?"" sagte Wörner. „Werden wir ein Ladendiebregister haben, in dem, wenn etwas bei JC Penney's fehlt, alle zusammengetrieben werden, die jemals wegen Ladendiebstahls verurteilt wurden, und dort anfangen?“ Das Problem bei solchen Dingen ist im Allgemeinen, dass es damit beginnen soll das Sammeln von Beweisen im Rahmen der Ermittlungen und die anschließende Festnahme von Personen aufgrund eines Verdachts. So etwas macht das rückwärts."" Worner äußerte sich auch besorgt darüber, dass das Geld, das für die Führung des Registers benötigt wird, möglicherweise aus den Taschen der Steuerzahler stammt. Er sagte, dass die von Straftätern gezahlten Gebühren die Register finanzieren sollten, aber das bedeutet nicht unbedingt, dass sie das tun werden Eine weitere große Sorge, sagte Worner, ist, dass dieses im Gegensatz zum Register der Sexualstraftäter nicht öffentlich zugänglich ist, was bedeutet, dass nur die Strafverfolgungsbehörden Zugriff auf die Liste haben. „Ich denke, wir würden argumentieren, dass es ein Problem mit dem Sammeln dieser Informationen gibt An erster Stelle, aber es ist eine wichtige Frage, die man sich stellen muss: Wenn Sie die Informationen vom Gesetz über öffentliche Aufzeichnungen ausnehmen müssen, sollten Sie sie dann überhaupt sammeln?“, fragte Worner Ungereimtheiten, und die Liste der Brandstifter wird von der Öffentlichkeit nicht überprüft, so dass viele potenzielle Probleme nicht angegangen werden.Schaffer sagte, die Liste werde nicht öffentlich sein, weil Verbrechen im Zusammenhang mit Brandstiftung sich sehr von Sexualdelikten unterscheiden, und er hat keine Aufforderung erhalten, die Liste zu veröffentlichen. „Ich habe noch kein einziges Mitglied der Öffentlichkeit um Zugang zu diesem Strafverfolgungsinstrument gebeten“, sagte Schaffer. „Es ist ein Werkzeug der Strafverfolgung. Aus dem gleichen Grund, aus dem Sie nicht auf die Datenbank des Bundesstaates Ohio für Nummernschilder von Personen zugreifen können. Was ist der Zweck?“ Er sagte, die Bereitstellung des Registers für die Öffentlichkeit sei nicht vom Tisch, aber die Einwohner von Ohio müssten den Wunsch äußern, die Liste einzusehen. Robert Cornwell, Exekutivdirektor der Buckeye State Sheriff's Association, sagte, er sei mit dem neuen Gesetz zufrieden, das seiner Meinung nach neue Techniken für Ermittler von Brandstiftungen bieten sollte. Cornwell sagte, seine Organisation billige das Register, weil die Polizei den Aufenthaltsort von verurteilten Brandstiftern kennen sollte. Er schätzte keinen viel größeren Arbeitsaufwand für die Sheriffs bei der Erstellung des Registers ein. Michael Duchesne, Sprecher des State Fire Marshal, drückte ebenfalls seine Unterstützung für das Register aus und sagte, es werde den Strafverfolgungsbehörden mehr Möglichkeiten bei der Untersuchung von Straftaten im Zusammenhang mit Brandstiftung bieten. Er sagte, es gebe genug verdächtige Brände in Ohio, um die Registrierung zu erfordern. Worner von der ACLU sagte, selbst wenn die Liste ein neues Instrument für die Strafverfolgung sei, werde sie keine Verbrechen beweisen. Ohioaner sollten sich Sorgen über den Präzedenzfall machen, den das Brandstiftungsregister schaffen könnte, sagte er. „Du musst die Straße runterschauen“, sagte Worner.

ad333c3f	Theresa Mays Hoffnungen auf einen erdrutschartigen Wahlsieg erlitten letzte Nacht einen schweren Schlag, nachdem ihr Umfragevorsprung inmitten des Streits um ihre Steuer- und Rentenpläne auf 11 Prozent einbrach. Eine Survation-Umfrage für The Mail on Sunday brachte die Konservativen auf 40 Prozent, gefolgt von Labour auf 29 Prozent und den Lib Dems und Ukip auf 11 Prozent. Das bedeutet, dass sich der Vorsprung von Frau May auf Jeremy Corbyn in vier Tagen fast halbiert hat: Eine Umfrage unmittelbar nach der Einberufung der Wahl gab den Tories einen Vorsprung von 21 Punkten. Eine Umfrage für die Mail on Sunday brachte die Konservativen auf 40 Prozent, gefolgt von Labour auf 29 Prozent. Es kommt nach einer Gegenreaktion gegen die Drohung, Zusagen fallen zu lassen, die Steuern nicht zu erhöhen und eine jährliche Rentenerhöhung von mindestens 2,5 Prozent zu garantieren. Der Umfrageexperte Professor John Curtice sagte, die Survation-Zahlen würden Frau May eine Mehrheit von 46 im Unterhaus geben, eine Verbesserung gegenüber ihrer derzeitigen Arbeitsmehrheit von 17, aber weit unter einigen Prognosen einer Mehrheit von 140 Sitzen. Der Einbruch der Konservativen folgt auf die Drohung, bestehende Zusagen fallen zu lassen, die Steuern nicht zu erhöhen und eine jährliche Rentenerhöhung von mindestens 2,5 Prozent zu garantieren. Die Gegenreaktion wurde durch die überraschende Ankündigung von Frau May weiter angeheizt, dass sie das umstrittene Versprechen der Partei, 0,7 Prozent des Nationaleinkommens für Auslandshilfe auszugeben, nicht aufgeben werde. Die Mail on Sunday-Umfrage ist die einzige, die durchgeführt wurde, nachdem alle drei Geschichten veröffentlicht wurden, und zeigt, dass die Wähler infolgedessen weniger wahrscheinlich Tory wählen. Die Premierministerin hat gestern drei Gelegenheiten verschmäht, Behauptungen zu widersprechen, dass sie David Camerons Wahlversprechen von 2015 fallen lassen wird, bis 2020 keine Einkommenssteuer, Sozialversicherung oder Mehrwertsteuer zu erhöhen. Sie wurde wiederholt bei einem Wahlkampf in Dudley, West Midlands, zur Rede gestellt und vermied es zu geben eine direkte Antwort, die lediglich betonte, die Tories seien eine Partei der „niedrigen Besteuerung“. Herr Corbyn versprach sofort, die Renten zu schützen. Bundeskanzler Philip Hammond löste eine Steuerangst aus und sagte, es sei „selbstverständlich klar, dass die Verpflichtungen im Manifest von 2015 die Fähigkeit der Regierung belasten, die Wirtschaft flexibel zu steuern“. Sie sagte: „Die Menschen werden eine sehr klare Wahl zwischen einem Konservativen haben Partei, die immer eine Partei war und bleiben wird, die an niedrigere Steuern glaubt. Oder Labour, dessen natürlicher Instinkt es ist, immer Steuern zu erhöhen.“ Die Tory-Turbulenzen kamen, nachdem Frau May sich geweigert hatte zu sagen, dass sie am sogenannten „Triple Lock“ der Renten festhalten würde, als sie am Freitag in ihrem Wahlkreis Maidenhead befragt wurde. Und Bundeskanzler Philip Hammond löste eine Steuerangst aus, indem er sagte, es sei „selbstverständlich klar, dass die Verpflichtungen im Manifest von 2015 die Fähigkeit der Regierung belasten, die Wirtschaft flexibel zu steuern.“ Schattenkanzler John McDonnell nannte die Erklärung von Herrn Hammond sofort eine „Tory-Steuerbombe“. , der den früheren Slogan der Tories gegen Labour entführte. 42 Prozent sagten, ein Tory-Erdrutsch wäre „gut“ für Großbritannien, 36 Prozent dagegen. Der frühere belgische Ministerpräsident Guy Verhofstadt beschuldigte sie eines „versuchten Machtergreifs“. Die Abgeordneten von Tory lehnten es ab, sich öffentlich zu äußern, aus Angst, die Erfolgschancen der Partei am 8. Juni zu beeinträchtigen. Privat waren sie jedoch zutiefst kritisch. „Es ist ein sehr unsauberer Start in unsere Kampagne“, sagte einer. „Jemand muss unsere Botschaft erfassen – und zwar schnell. So gewinnt man keine Stimmen.“ Der frühere Tory-Kanzler Norman Lamont sagte: „Ich denke, Phillip Hammond versucht nur, wieder etwas Flexibilität in das System zu bringen, obwohl es eine andere Frage ist, ob er klug war, dies zu sagen. „Es ist ziemlich ironisch, dass ausgerechnet Labour die „Steuerbomben“-Linie benutzt.“ Hochrangige Tory-Quellen bestanden darauf, dass „keine endgültige Entscheidung“ über das Manifest der Partei zu Renten und Steuern getroffen worden sei. Labour und die Lib Dems nutzten die Verwirrung. Herr Corbyn versprach sofort, die Renten zu schützen, und der ehemalige Kabinettsminister der Lib Dem, Vince Cable, sagte: „Herr Hammond gab zu, dass die Steuern steigen müssten, zweifellos aufgrund des harten Brexits von Frau May, der ein schwarzes Loch von 100 Milliarden Pfund in den öffentlichen Finanzen hinterlassen könnte. „Sie können keine starke Wirtschaft und keinen harten Brexit haben.“ In der Umfrage gefragt, ob die Weigerung von Frau May, die Beendigung der Rentengarantie auszuschließen, ihre Stimme beeinflussen würde, sagten 28 Prozent, dass sie mit geringerer Wahrscheinlichkeit Tory wählen würden, gegenüber 17 Prozent Cent, die wahrscheinlicher waren. Die Weigerung von Herrn Hammond, eine Steuererhöhung auszuschließen, löste eine ähnlich negative Reaktion aus. Und 34 Prozent sagten, die Weigerung, die Auslandshilfe zu kürzen, würde sie weniger wahrscheinlich konservativ wählen lassen. Nur 13 Prozent gaben an, dass dies wahrscheinlicher sei. Der frühere Kabinettsminister der Liberaldemokraten, Vince Cable, sagte: „Sie können keine starke Wirtschaft und keinen harten Brexit haben.“ Frau May wurde gestern vom Brexit-Koordinator des Europäischen Parlaments wegen der vorgezogenen Wahlen als „politische Opportunistin“ gebrandmarkt nachdem Hammond gezwungen war, Pläne zur Erhöhung der Sozialversicherung für Selbständige aufgrund des Aufruhrs über die Auswirkungen auf den „weißen Lieferwagenmann“ und die Tatsache, dass er gegen das Manifestversprechen von 2015 zu Steuererhöhungen verstoßen hatte, aufzugeben. Trotz des stark reduzierten Vorsprungs scheinen die Wähler angesichts der Aussicht auf einen Tory-Erdrutsch entspannt. Insgesamt 42 Prozent sagten, es wäre „gut“ für Großbritannien, 36 Prozent dagegen. Es gab gestern Abend mehr Tory-Verwirrung, als der konservative Abgeordnete Andrew Bridgen behauptete, eine „hochrangige Regierungsperson“ habe ihm mitgeteilt, dass das Parteiprogramm eine Verpflichtung enthalten würde, die umstrittene Hochgeschwindigkeitszugverbindung 2 nach Birmingham zu streichen. Quellen aus der Downing Street bestritten die Behauptung. Und Frau May wurde gestern vom Brexit-Koordinator des Europäischen Parlaments wegen der vorgezogenen Wahlen als „politische Opportunistin“ gebrandmarkt. Der frühere belgische Premierminister Guy Verhofstadt beschuldigte sie eines „versuchten Machtergreifs … bevor die Realität des Brexits beißt“. Letzte Nacht brachte eine Opinium-Umfrage, die vor dem Streit um Steuern, Renten und Auslandshilfe durchgeführt wurde, die Tory-Führung auf 19 Punkte.	Profil: Seal Team Six	false

c1343280	✖ In etwas mehr als einem Jahr soll Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness in die Kinos kommen, mit der Rückkehr des gleichnamigen Charakters, gespielt von Benedict Cumberbatch, und seinen zahlreichen Nebendarstellern. Bevor der Film in wenigen Monaten mit den Dreharbeiten beginnt, hat ein engagierter Fan-Künstler das verrückteste Stück Doctor Strange-Fankunst geschaffen, das wir je gesehen haben. Wenn wir ehrlich sein müssen, sind wir uns nicht sicher, ob uns irgendetwas anderes so für den Film begeistern kann wie dieses Poster. Das Poster, das vom Fan-Künstler @sethtember auf Instagram geteilt wurde, nimmt die Abgefahrenheit dessen, was wir in Doctor Strange gesehen haben, und hebt es auf eine ganz neue Ebene. Mit dem Zeitstein und dem Auge von Agamatto enthält der Beitrag Cumberbatchs Sorcerer Supreme in verschiedenen Formen. Der Hintergrund enthält einige Dark Dimension-ähnliche Effekte, die es so aussehen lassen, als würden Zeit und Realität in sich zusammenfallen. Alles in allem ist es absolut markengerecht für den Charakter. Überzeugen Sie sich unten selbst. Trotz einiger massiver Änderungen vor der Produktion deuten Berichte darauf hin, dass der Film immer noch auf dem richtigen Weg ist, um sein Erscheinungsdatum einzuhalten. Es wurde gesagt, dass der Film der erste „gruselige“ Film innerhalb des Marvel Cinematic Universe sein wird, etwas, das Marvel Studios-Chef Kevin Feige zuvor mit Jäger des verlorenen Schatzes verglichen hat. „Ich meine, es gibt schreckliche Sequenzen in Raiders, die ich als kleines Kind gesehen habe würde [meine Augen bedecken], wenn ihre Gesichter schmolzen. Oder natürlich Temple of Doom oder Gremlins oder Poltergeist“, sagte Feige. „Das sind übrigens die Filme, die das PG-13-Rating erfunden haben. Sie waren PG und dann sagten sie: „Wir brauchen eine andere [Rating]“. Aber das macht Spaß. Es macht Spaß, auf diese Weise Angst zu haben, und nicht auf eine schreckliche, quälende Weise, sondern auf eine Weise, die berechtigterweise beängstigend ist – denn Scott Derrickson ist ziemlich gut darin – aber beängstigend im Dienste einer berauschenden Emotion.“ Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness erscheint am 7.

da2b6121	Anti-Intellektuell, Anti-Wissenschaft, Anti-Bildung: In einer beunruhigenden Entwicklung hat das Ohio House Gesetze verabschiedet, die es Studenten ermöglichen würden, falsche Antworten zu geben, ohne bestraft zu werden, wenn diese falschen Antworten auf dem „aufrichtigen religiösen Glauben“ des Studenten beruhen. Cleveland.com berichtet: Das Ohio House schickte am Mittwoch eine Maßnahme an den Senat, die öffentlichen Schulen verbieten würde, Schüler für Arbeiten zu bestrafen, die religiöse Überzeugungen enthalten. Kritiker haben den Gesetzentwurf als unnötig bezeichnet oder die Religion über den Säkularismus gestellt … WKRC berichtet: Das Ohio House hat am Mittwoch das „Student Religious Liberties Act“ verabschiedet. Nach dem Gesetz können Studenten nicht bestraft werden, wenn ihre Arbeit wissenschaftlich falsch ist, solange die Begründung auf ihrer religiösen Überzeugung beruht. Cleveland.com berichtet über das neue Gesetz und stellt fest: Wenn Schüler öffentlicher Schulen eine Arbeit abgeben und sagen, dass die Erde nur 10.000 Jahre alt ist, können sie nicht nach Ohio House Bill 164 bestraft werden, wenn es ihre religiösen Überzeugungen sind. House Bill 164, bekannt als Ohio Student Religious Liberties Act von 2019, beinhaltet Folgendes: Verlangt, dass öffentliche Schulen den Schülern den gleichen Zugang zu Einrichtungen gewähren, wenn sie sich zum religiösen Ausdruck treffen wollen, wie sie es säkularen Gruppen gewähren würden. Entfernt eine Bestimmung, die es Schulbezirken erlaubt, die religiöse Äußerung auf die Mittagspausen oder andere unterrichtsfreie Zeiten zu beschränken. Ermöglicht den Schülern, sich vor, während und nach der Schule in gleichem Maße an religiösen Ausdrucksformen zu beteiligen wie ein Schüler an weltlichen Aktivitäten oder Ausdrucksformen. Verbietet Schulen, einen Schüler daran zu hindern, sich bei der Erledigung von Hausaufgaben, Kunstwerken und anderen Aufgaben an religiösen Ausdrucksformen zu beteiligen. Kurz gesagt, das vorgeschlagene Gesetz von Ohio würde es den Schülern erlauben, die Wissenschaft durch religiöse Dogmen zu ersetzen, und würde es den Lehrern nicht erlauben, Schüler für das Geben falscher Antworten zu bestrafen, solange diese Antworten auf den religiösen Überzeugungen des Schülers beruhen. House Bill 164 wurde mit 61 zu 3 Stimmen angenommen. Jeder Republikaner im Repräsentantenhaus unterstützte das Gesetz. Sie wechselt nun in den von den Republikanern kontrollierten Senat. Fazit: Das Ohio House hat Gesetze verabschiedet, die es Schülern ermöglichen würden, falsche Antworten zu geben, ohne bestraft zu werden, wenn diese falschen Antworten auf dem „aufrichtigen religiösen Glauben“ des Schülers beruhen.

7be6b208	Der Minderheitsführer des Senats, Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), sagte am Montag, dass der frühere Vizepräsident Joe Biden „erwägt“, jedem Kreditnehmer mit einem Jahresgehalt von unter 125.000 US-Dollar 50.000 US-Dollar an Bundesschulden für Studentendarlehen zu erlassen – ein Schritt, der eine unglaublich schwere Belastung darstellen würde auf Steuerzahler. Mehr als 40 Millionen Amerikaner haben derzeit ausstehende Bundesdarlehen in Höhe von insgesamt 1,54 Billionen US-Dollar an Schulden. Was hat er gesagt? „Wir sind zu dem Schluss gekommen, dass Präsident Biden diese Schulden rückgängig machen kann, am ersten Tag, an dem er Präsident wird, Schulden in Höhe von 50.000 Dollar erlassen kann“, kündigte Schumer den Anhängern außerhalb seines New Yorker Büros an. „Sie brauchen den Kongress nicht, alles, was Sie brauchen, ist ein Federschnipsen.“ „Ich habe ihm gesagt, wie wichtig das ist. Er erwägt es“, fügte Schumer hinzu, nachdem ein Reporter gefragt hatte, ob er mit Biden über den Vorschlag gesprochen habe. „Wir glauben, dass er [die Exekutivgewalt] hat, und er recherchiert das. Ich glaube, wenn er seine Nachforschungen anstellt, wird er feststellen, dass er es tut.“ Während der demokratischen Vorwahlen 2020 drückte Biden seine Unterstützung für einen demokratischen Gesetzesvorschlag aus, der jedem Kreditnehmer sofort Schulden von bis zu 10.000 US-Dollar erlassen würde Die Partei hat den ehemaligen Vizepräsidenten gedrängt, den Kongress zu umgehen und die Schulden per Exekutivbeschluss zu erlassen. Ob es verfassungsgemäß ist, dass ein Präsident eine solche Maßnahme ergreift, bleibt fraglich. Was sonst? Später während der Veranstaltung drückte ein Reporter Schumer darauf Gerechtigkeit der Schuldentilgung.“ Was ist mit den Familien, die Opfer gebracht haben, um die Studentendarlehen für ihre Studenten zurückzuzahlen? Was ist mit den Studenten, die ihre Studiendarlehen abbezahlt haben?“, fragte der Reporter. „Sehen Sie“, antwortete Schumer, „viele Studenten haben Studiendarlehen abbezahlt, aber es ist eine solche Belastung, dass es für alle gut ist, dafür zu sorgen, dass diese Schulden beglichen werden. “ Nachdem die Veranstaltung zu Ende war, verspottete eine der Personen, die neben Schumer standen, die Frage des Reporters und wischte sie als nur die „Fox News-Perspektive“ zu diesem Thema ab. „Diese Menschen haben eine große Zukunft, aber sie sind mit Schulden belastet … . wir wollen es entfernen“, hatte Schumer während der Veranstaltung unmissverständlich erklärt. Doch trotz Schumers Darstellung des Schuldenerlasses als offensichtliche, freundliche Lösung ist es in Wirklichkeit weit davon entfernt. Wie TheBlaze zuvor berichtete, im Gegensatz zu dem, was fortschrittliche Politiker behaupten: „'Schuldenerlass' ist nicht etwas, das wirklich existiert. Der Gesetzgeber könnte die Haftung eines Kreditnehmers für die Rückzahlung der Schulden aufheben, aber die Schulden werden auf jemanden abgewälzt“ und „im Fall von Studentendarlehen des Bundes würde die Last weiter auf die Steuerzahler abgewälzt“.

052f60f4	Die Erde könnte einer weiteren Eiszeit gegenüberstehen, warnen Wissenschaftler Wissenschaftler, die das antarktische Meereis untersuchen, warnen davor, dass eine Zunahme der Ansammlung die nächste Eiszeit auslösen könnte. Wissenschaftler, die das Meereis der Antarktis untersuchen, warnen davor, dass eine Zunahme der Ansammlung eine Eiszeit auslösen könnte. Computersimulationen zeigen, dass eine Explosion von Meereis den Ozean daran hindern würde, Kohlendioxid mit der Atmosphäre auszutauschen . Dies kann einen umgekehrten Treibhauseffekt verursachen, der letztendlich die Erde abkühlen und unseren Planeten zum ersten Mal seit über zwei Millionen Jahren in eine Eiszeit schicken würde. Die letzte große Eiszeit endete vermutlich vor etwa 2,5 Millionen Jahren im Pleistozän. Seitdem haben Gletscher regelmäßig die Erde bedeckt, sich dann aber zurückgezogen, und Experten haben sich nun daran gemacht, den Prozess hinter einer Eiszeit zu verstehen – wie sie funktioniert und was sie auslöst. Die neueste Studie wurde von einem Team der University of Chicago durchgeführt, das sich zum Ziel gesetzt hat, die Prozesse zu entdecken und zu verstehen, die das globale Klima ausmachen. Assistenzprofessor Malte Jansen von der University of Chicago (UChicago) sagte: „Eine Schlüsselfrage auf diesem Gebiet ist nach wie vor, was dazu geführt hat, dass die Erde periodisch in und aus Eiszeiten wechselt.“ „Wir sind ziemlich zuversichtlich, dass das Kohlenstoffgleichgewicht zwischen der Atmosphäre und der Ozean müssen sich verändert haben, aber wir wissen nicht genau, wie oder warum.“ Dieses Ereignis kann einen umgekehrten Treibhauseffekt verursachen, der letztendlich die Erde abkühlen und unseren Planeten zum ersten Mal seit über zwei Jahren in eine Eiszeit schicken würde Millionen Jahre Jansen und die ehemalige UChicago-Postdoktorandin Alice Marzocchi entwickelten Computersimulationen des antarktischen Meereises und stellten fest, dass es nicht nur die Ozeanzirkulation verändert, sondern auch als Deckel fungiert und es daran hindert, Kohlendioxid in die Atmosphäre freizusetzen – je weniger Kohlenstoff in der Luft, desto kühler der Planet wird. „Das deutet darauf hin, dass es sich um eine Rückkopplungsschleife handelt“, sagte Marzocchi, jetzt Forschungswissenschaftler am britischen National Oceanography Centre. „Wenn die Temperatur sinkt, wird weniger Kohlenstoff in die Atmosphäre freigesetzt, was zu einer stärkeren Abkühlung führt.“ Die Erklärung passt zu Beweisen für das vergangene Klima aus Quellen wie Sedimenten, Korallenriffen und Kernproben von Gletschern. „Was mich überrascht hat, ist, wie viel von dieser erhöhten Speicherung allein auf physikalische Veränderungen zurückzuführen ist, wobei die antarktische Meereisbedeckung der Hauptakteur ist“, sagte Marzocchi.

3963580	Die National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) wurde wieder einmal dabei erwischt, wie sie die „globale Erwärmung“ übertrieb, indem sie mit den rohen Temperaturdaten herumspielte. Dieses Mal betreffen diese Daten die jüngste rekordverdächtige Kälte im Nordosten der USA, die die NOAA aus der Geschichte zu löschen versucht. Wenn Sie den Diagrammen der NOAA glauben, war das kalte Wetter dieses Winters nicht besonders ungewöhnlich, was dazu führte, dass Haie im Ozean gefrieren und Leguane von den Bäumen fallen. Hier ist die NOAA-Karte vom Januar 2018 für den Nordosten der USA – ein Gebiet, das Neuengland sowie NY, PA, NJ, DE und MD umfasst. Sie würden nie daraus schließen, dass diese Regionen gerade eine rekordverdächtige Kälte erlebt haben, oder? Das liegt daran, dass die NOAA, wie Paul Homewood herausgefunden hat, die Bücher gefälscht hat. Wieder einmal – vermutlich aus Gründen, die mehr mit Ideologie als mit Meteorologie zu tun haben – hat die NOAA vergangene Temperaturen angepasst, um kälter auszusehen, als sie waren, und die jüngsten Temperaturen, um wärmer auszusehen, als sie waren. Wir sprechen hier nicht von Bruchteilen eines Grades. Die Anpassungen belaufen sich auf satte 3,1 Grad F. Dies führt uns weit über die Regionen der Fehlergrenzen oder harmlosen Fehler hinaus und tief in das Reich der Fiktion und politischen Propaganda. Homewood witterte zum ersten Mal eine Ratte, als er die New Yorker Datensätze untersuchte. Er war besonders verwirrt über die Behandlung des besonders kalten Winters, der New York 2013/14 durch die NOAA verwüstete und den er hier beschreibt: Das kalte Wetter begann wirklich am 2. Januar, als eine arktische Front über einen Großteil des Landes hereinbrach und sich weit hinein erstreckte Marsch. Die NWS schrieb am Ende des Winters: Der Winter 2013-14 endete für den Staat New York als einer der kältesten Winter der jüngsten Vergangenheit. Der Schneefall in West- und Nord-Zentral-New York war für viele Gebiete über dem Normalwert und an einigen Orten sogar weit über dem Normalwert. Dieser Winter folgt auf zwei frühere milde Winter, wodurch sich die Kälte und der Schnee in diesem Winter viel härter anfühlen. Die Temperaturen in diesem Winter endeten jeden Monat unter dem Normalwert, und der Zeitrahmen von Januar bis März endete mindestens 4 Grad unter dem Normalwert für die beiden Hauptklimastationen im Westen von New York (Buffalo und Rochester). Region. Warum also, fragte er sich, hat die NOAA diesen Winter als nur den 30. kältesten Winter (seit 1895) auf ihren New York State Charts mit einer Durchschnittstemperatur von 16,9 F notiert? Homewood verglich die lokalen Aufzeichnungen für Januar 1943 und Januar 2014 – Monate, die laut NOAA-Diagrammen sehr ähnliche Durchschnittstemperaturen aufwiesen. Was er fand, war, dass die Diagramme der NOAA zutiefst ungenau waren. Die lokalen Temperaturen von 2014 wurden von der NOAA nach oben korrigiert und die lokalen Temperaturen von 1943 nach unten. Er kommt zu dem Schluss: Im Durchschnitt waren die Durchschnittstemperaturen im Januar 2014 2,7 F niedriger als 1943. Doch laut NOAA betrug der Unterschied nur 0,9 F. Irgendwie hat die NOAA die vergangenen Temperaturen relativ um 1,8 °F nach unten korrigiert. Jetzt hat Homewood dem letzten Big Freeze – dem Winter 2017/2018 – die gleiche Behandlung zuteil werden lassen. Wieder einmal hat er festgestellt, dass die willkürlichen Anpassungen der NOAA eine Lüge sind. Sie behaupten, dass der Januar 2018 in der Region New York wärmer war als der Januar 1943, obwohl die Rohdaten von lokalen Sendern uns sagen, dass dies einfach nicht wahr ist. An den drei Standorten Ithaka, Auburn und Genf stellen wir also fest, dass der Januar 2018 um 1,0, 1,7 bzw. 1,3 °F kälter war als der Januar 1943. Die NOAA sagt jedoch, dass die Division im letzten Monat 2,1 °F wärmer war. Die Zahl der NOAA macht den letzten Monat im Vergleich zu 1943 um mindestens 3,1 °F wärmer, als die tatsächlichen Stationsdaten rechtfertigen. Er kommt zu dem Schluss: Die hochgradig homogenisierte und angepasste Version der Temperaturaufzeichnung der Central Lakes durch die NOAA hat eindeutig keinerlei Ähnlichkeit mit den tatsächlichen Stationsdaten. Und wenn diese eine Division so schwer im Irrtum ist, wie groß ist dann die Zuversicht, dass es dem Rest der USA besser geht? Nun ja. Der entscheidende Punkt hier ist, dass die NOAA zwar häufig diese Anpassungen an den Rohdaten vornimmt, aber nie eine überzeugende Erklärung dafür geliefert hat, warum sie notwendig sind. Noch nicht, wie genau ihre angepassten Daten eine genauere Version der Wahrheit liefern als die ursprünglichen Daten. Eine Entschuldigung der NOAA-Verteidiger ist, dass Wetterstationen sich ändernden Umweltbedingungen unterliegen. Zum Beispiel, als sich die 1929 in Syrakus stationierte Station auf einem ursprünglich nur spärlichen Flugplatz befand. Seitdem hat er sich jedoch, wie Homewood feststellt, zu einem großen internationalen Flughafen mit zwei Start- und Landebahnen entwickelt, die zwei Millionen Passagiere pro Jahr bedienen. Die Messwerte der Wetterstation werden daher sicherlich durch den Urban Heat Island-Effekt verfälscht worden sein: Das heißt, die Messwerte der Temperatur wurden durch die Wärme der umgebenden Bebauung und der Flugzeugtriebwerke künstlich erhöht. Sie würden also denken, nicht wahr, dass die NOAA die jüngsten Temperaturen nach unten korrigieren würde, um diese NOAA zu kompensieren? Stattdessen hat sie sie ohne ersichtlichen Grund nach oben korrigiert. Das ist ein Skandal. Die Klima-Gatekeeper der NOAA sind politische Aktivisten, keine ehrlichen Wissenschaftler, und der US-Steuerzahler hat nichts damit zu tun, ihre Propaganda zu finanzieren. Den Sumpf trocken legen!

136d378a	Ungeimpfte Kinder stellen für niemanden ein Risiko dar, sagt der Harvard-Immunologe	Eine der Stärken – und Schwächen – der westlichen medizinischen Ausbildung ist ihre Neigung, Dinge aufzuschlüsseln und zu unterteilen. Während viele Daten in den Details gesammelt werden, wird den Wechselbeziehungen zwischen den Disziplinen nur sehr wenig Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt. Während ein Medizinstudent ein echter Spezialist auf seinem Gebiet werden kann, werden auch sie abgegrenzt und kennen oft sehr wichtige Informationen nicht, die für einen breiteren, ganzheitlicheren Überblick unerlässlich wären. Und dies scheint beabsichtigt zu sein.  Werbung - mehr erfahren Ein typisches Beispiel ist die Aussage von Tetyana Obukhanych, die ihren Ph.D. in Immunologie an der Rockefeller University in New York und absolvierte ein Postgraduiertenstudium in Harvard. In einer Präsentation, die sie in British Columbia hielt (vollständiges Video hier), diskutierte sie wissenschaftliche Beweise aus einer Veröffentlichung, die sich mit einem Masernausbruch in Quebec im Jahr 2011 befasste. Die Beweise zeigten, dass 48 % derjenigen, die sich mit Masern infiziert hatten, vollständig gegen Masern geimpft waren. und dies schließt nicht einmal diejenigen ein, die nur einmal gegen Masern geimpft wurden, da sie mit den Ungeimpften in einen Topf geworfen werden. Sie nahm sich einen Moment Zeit, um zu erzählen, wie sie auf dieses Phänomen aufmerksam wurde: Das Interessante ist, dass mein Fachgebiet, das Fachgebiet der Immunologie, das grundlegende Fachgebiet, das für all diese Theorien der Immunität verantwortlich ist, wir nicht wirklich sich mit der realen Welt auseinandersetzen. Wir forschen in Laboren. Wir sind so etwas wie ein Beruf im Elfenbeinturm und wir lesen diese Publikationen nicht einmal, weil das zu weit von unserem Fachgebiet entfernt ist. Wir lesen nur, was für unsere Forschung spezifisch ist, und normalerweise sind es Immunisierungen und wie Antikörper erzeugt werden, und alle Details der Immunantworten. Und ich habe meine gesamte Promotionsausbildung durchlaufen und geglaubt, dass Impfungen einem Immunität verleihen und dass es absolut unmöglich, praktisch unmöglich ist, dass man eine Krankheit bekommt, wenn man Impfungen bekommt, und ich bin mir ziemlich sicher, dass die meisten meiner Kollegen in meinem engeren Feld glaubten genauso, und wir hatten Gespräche darüber. Und irgendwann erwähnte mich sogar jemand und sagte, dass er einen Impfstoff hatte und Masern bekam, und ich wischte es irgendwie beiseite und dachte, dass die Person verwirrt ist. Entweder hatte sie keinen Impfstoff oder es waren keine Masern, eines von beiden. Aber was passiert ist, dass ich vor ein paar Jahren die amerikanische Staatsbürgerschaft beantragen musste und Teil des Verfahrens ist, Ihre Impfunterlagen einzureichen, richtig, und dies war das erste Mal, dass ich meine eigenen Impfunterlagen sorgfältig ansah, und das entdeckte ich Ich hatte in meiner Kindheit zwei Masernimpfungen. Nun, ich wusste nichts davon, weil ich zu jung war, um mich daran zu erinnern, aber woran ich mich wirklich gut erinnere, ist, dass ich mit 11 Masern hatte, und das war ein bisschen schwerer zu ignorieren. Und ich habe es kürzlich jemand anderem erzählt und sie sagten: „Oh, Sie sind verwirrt darüber, Sie hatten keine Masern!“ wie „Woher wissen Sie das?“ „Haben Sie überprüft, <ob> Sie wirklich das Virus dort hatten oder nicht ?“ Es ist also nur die Diagnose des Arztes, richtig? Aber ich lebte in der Ukraine, und dort gab es tonnenweise Masern, und die Ärzte wussten, wenn sie Masern sahen. Aber wie auch immer, der Grund, warum ich irgendwie nach diesen Papieren suchen musste, ist, um mir selbst zu bestätigen, ob ich wegen meiner Masern verwirrt bin oder ob dies ein allgemeines Phänomen ist und es passiert und in der Literatur dokumentiert ist. Und tatsächlich ist es in der Literatur dokumentiert. Aber Immunologen wissen nichts davon. Lassen Sie das einen Moment auf sich wirken. Sie promovieren in Immunologie und verlassen die Schule, um in die Welt hinauszugehen und an Dingen wie, oh, Impfungen zu arbeiten, und Sie haben nicht gelernt, dass Sie immer noch bestimmte Krankheiten bekommen können, selbst wenn Sie vollständig dagegen geimpft sind ? Obwohl dies wissenschaftlich belegt und unbestritten ist? Mal wieder Ignoranz durch Design.	false
eb73a5be	Nachrichtenberichte haben bestätigt, dass der Schauspieler Kirk Douglas am späten Nachmittag eines natürlichen Todes gestorben ist, berichtete das Gerichtsmedizinerbüro von Los Angeles. Das war nur 4 Tage bevor er 101 Jahre alt geworden wäre. Die Familie veröffentlichte eine Erklärung, in der es hieß, er sei „bequem gegangen und habe keine Schmerzen gehabt“ und „ein langes und erfolgreiches Leben geführt, von dem die Menschen nur träumen“. Kirk Douglas war ein US-amerikanischer Schauspieler, Produzent, Regisseur und Autor. Er war einer der letzten lebenden Menschen des Goldenen Zeitalters der Filmindustrie. Nach einer ärmlichen Kindheit mit Einwanderereltern und sechs Schwestern hatte er sein Filmdebüt in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) mit Barbara Stanwyck. Douglas entwickelte sich in den 1950er und 1960er Jahren bald zu einem führenden Kassenstar, der für ernsthafte Dramen bekannt war, darunter Western und Kriegsfilme. Während seiner Karriere spielte er in mehr als 90 Filmen mit. Douglas war bekannt für seinen explosiven Schauspielstil. Als Schauspieler und Philanthrop hatte Douglas drei Oscar-Nominierungen, einen Oscar für sein Lebenswerk und die Presidential Medal of Freedom erhalten. Als Autor hatte er zehn Romane und Memoiren geschrieben. Er war Nr. 17 auf der Liste der größten männlichen Leinwandlegenden des klassischen Hollywood-Kinos des American Film Institute und die ranghöchste lebende Person auf der Liste. Nachdem er 1991 einen Hubschrauberabsturz nur knapp überlebt hatte und 1996 einen Schlaganfall erlitt, hatte er sich darauf konzentriert, sein spirituelles und religiöses Leben zu erneuern. Er lebte mit seiner zweiten Frau (seit 63 Jahren), Anne Buydens, einer Produzentin, zusammen. Er sollte am 9. Dezember 2016 101 Jahre alt werden.

80462bce	Laut den neuesten offiziellen Zahlen sind Gutverdiener in professionellen Berufen wie Ärzte, Anwälte und Lehrer viel häufiger regelmäßige Alkoholtrinker als Durchschnittsverdiener. Die Daten aus zwei Berichten zeigen, dass Menschen, die mehr als 40.000 Pfund pro Jahr verdienen, ihren Wein, ihr Bier oder ihren Whisky mögen und es sich leisten können. Vier von fünf 79 % in England gaben an, in der vergangenen Woche Alkohol getrunken zu haben – eine Frage, die zur Messung der Trinkgewohnheiten in Umfragen verwendet wird – verglichen mit 58 % aller Erwachsenen. Der Alkoholkonsum nimmt mit dem sozioökonomischen Status stetig zu: Menschen, deren Arbeit als Routine- und Handarbeit eingestuft wird, darunter Arbeiter, Rezeptionisten und Pflegekräfte, hatten in der Woche vor der Befragung am seltensten Alkohol getrunken. Die Berichte stammen nur von NHS Digital England und dem Office for National Statistics. Die ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey zeigt, dass in Großbritannien im Jahr 2017 schätzungsweise 29,2 Millionen Erwachsene angaben, in der Woche vor der Befragung Alkohol getrunken zu haben. England hatte mit 57,8 % den höchsten Anteil an Erwachsenen, die angaben, in der Vorwoche Alkohol getrunken zu haben, gefolgt von Schottland mit 53,5 % und Wales mit 50,0 %; In den englischen Regionen war Rauschtrinken unter Alkoholkonsumenten im Nordwesten häufiger und im Südosten am seltensten. Wie viel Menschen trinken, hängt vom Alter ab. Ein Fünftel der Menschen gab an, überhaupt nicht zu trinken. Sie waren am ehesten zwischen 25 und 64 Jahre alt. Diejenigen, die am ehesten Alkohol tranken, waren über 65 Jahre alt. Wenn die Jungen Alkohol trinken, neigen sie am ehesten dazu, Freitag- und Samstagabende zu trinken und dann für den Rest der Woche nicht zu trinken. Daten aus früheren Jahren des Health Survey for England zeigten, dass der schädlichste Alkoholkonsum bei Menschen mittleren Alters stattfand, die mit größerer Wahrscheinlichkeit jeden Tag tranken. „Es ist unwahrscheinlich, dass Trinker aus der Mittelklasse den Gesundheitswarnungen der Regierung Beachtung schenken, da sie möglicherweise weniger übermäßig betrunken werden und Preiserhöhungen aushalten können“, sagte Steve Clarke, ein Manager für Therapiedienste für Alkoholabhängigkeit bei der Priory Group. „Vor allem die über 45-Jährigen trinken regelmäßiger, denken aber nicht, dass sie in Gefahr sind. Aber sie trinken vier, fünf, sechs Tage die Woche, und das summiert sich. In den Jahren 2016-17 [in England] gab es schätzungsweise 337.000 Krankenhauseinweisungen, die auf Alkohol zurückzuführen waren – das ist ein Anstieg von 17 %, fast ein Fünftel, im Vergleich zu 2006-07“, sagte er. Die Daten wurden am Dienstag veröffentlicht, dem Tag, an dem Schottland nach einem langen Kampf mit der Alkoholindustrie, die ihre Rechtmäßigkeit vor Gericht angefochten hat, Mindestpreise je Einheit einführt. Die ONS-Ergebnisse unterstützen andere Beweise dafür, dass der Preis ein wichtiger Faktor für die Trinkgewohnheiten der Menschen ist. Aktivisten und Experten hoffen, dass die Mindestpreise pro Einheit die Menschen, insbesondere die Schwächsten, dazu bringen werden, auf die stärksten Getränke zu verzichten, weil sie teurer werden. Sie setzen sich dafür ein, dass England dem Beispiel Schottlands folgt. „Die Regierung von Westminster sollte jetzt dem Beispiel Schottlands folgen und MUP in England einführen“, sagte Sir Ian Gilmore, Vorsitzender der Alcohol Health Alliance, einer Koalition von mehr als 50 Organisationen. „Billiger Alkohol zerstört sowohl in England als auch in Schottland Leben und Existenzgrundlagen. In England gibt es jedes Jahr mehr als 23.000 Todesfälle im Zusammenhang mit Alkohol, und viele davon kommen aus den ärmsten und am stärksten gefährdeten Teilen der Gesellschaft.“ Er fügte hinzu: „Mindestpreise je Einheit werden Leben retten, Kriminalität verringern und den öffentlichen Finanzen zugute kommen. Gleichzeitig bleiben die Kneipenpreise unberührt, und moderate Trinker werden den Unterschied unter MUP kaum bemerken. „Jede Verzögerung bei der Umsetzung von MUP in England wird nur Leben kosten und zu unnötigen alkoholbedingten Schäden führen. Wir fordern die Regierung von Westminster auf, jetzt zu handeln.“ Der Mindestpreis je Einheit legt den niedrigsten Preis fest, zu dem eine Einheit Alkohol verkauft werden kann, der in Schottland jetzt 50 Pence beträgt. Ein Pint Bier mit zwei Einheiten muss nun mindestens 1 £ kosten, und eine Flasche Wein mit neun Einheiten muss mindestens 4,50 £ kosten. Aber die größten Auswirkungen werden die sehr starken Apfelweine und andere starke alkoholische Getränke haben, die sehr billig waren und oft von Alkoholikern gekauft werden.

48eec6b0	The number of white suspected terrorists being arrested in the UK has overtaken those of Asian appearance for the first time in more than a decade. Statistics released by the Home Office show an overall fall in terror arrests of 22 per cent in the year, with 351 made in the 12 months to the end of June. “The fall is partly due to a relatively large number of arrests being made following terrorist attacks in London and Manchester last year,” a report said. White suspects accounted for 38 per cent of terror-related arrests, followed by those of Asian appearance on 37 per cent and black suspects on 9 per cent. “This was the first time, since the year ending June 2005, that the proportion of white people arrested has exceeded the proportion of Asian people arrested,” the report said. “It was the second highest number of arrests of white people in a year since the data collection began in 2001.” The demographics of terrorists in prison, where Islamists make up the majority, is also changing, as the number of far-right extremists jailed rises.

Read our privacy notice The Home Office said: “The number of Islamist, extremist prisoners saw a slight decrease for the first time. ✕ Isis fighters in Afghanistan are communicating with UK terror cells, defence secretary Gavin Williamson says “The proportion of prisoners holding far-right ideologies has increased steadily over the past three years, with the number up from 10 to 28 in the latest year.” Terror arrests have risen significantly since Isis declared its so-called “state” across Syria and Iraq, causing at least 900 people to leave the UK for its territories and others, who remained in the country, arrested for raising money for the group, spreading its propaganda and planning to commit attacks. Then in 2016, National Action became the first far-right group to ever be declared a terrorist organisation in the UK, with waves of police raids targeting the neo-Nazis. Experts have warned of the threat of “reciprocal radicalisation”, where Islamists and the far-right feed off each other to drive support to their own ideologies. Since the Westminster attack in March 2017, security services have foiled 13 Islamist plots and four from the extreme right-wing, seeing numerous would-be killers jailed. Of the five attacks launched in London and Manchester last year, leaving a total of 36 victims dead, Isis claimed responsibility for four and one was carried out by a far-right extremist targeting Muslims. Islamists make up 82 per cent of terrorist prisoners, followed by 13 per cent far-right and the rest made up of other ideologies including links to Northern Ireland. Police leaders said the past year saw highest number of terrorists tried and successfully convicted, since data collection began in 2009. Life sentences were handed out in 10 cases, including for the men who mounted the Finsbury Park and Parsons Green terror attacks.

The number of active investigations being carried out by specialist police and the security services has reached it’s highest ever level, currently standing at more than 650 probes focusing on the “most dangerous individuals”. “Demands upon CT Policing have increased by about a third since the start of 2017,” said deputy assistant commissioner Haydon. “The step-change in terrorist activity is matched only by an increased effort from police and security services, and our officers are working incredibly hard to protect the public and to bring people to justice, which is evidenced by the impressive conviction rate achieved in the last year. “But I would also like to use this opportunity to remind the public that they, too, play a part in these successes. “Many of these arrests, convictions and investigations hinge upon vital information provided by members of the public.” The figures came as the government consults on new terror laws contained in the Counter Terrorism and Border Security Bill. If enacted, it could spark a dramatic increase in terror arrests, which are currently being made under two Terrorism Acts, by introducing new crimes. They include viewing terrorist propaganda online just once, entering “designated areas” abroad, and making “reckless” statements that could drive support for a banned group. People are urged to report suspicious activity online at www.gov.uk/ACT or via the confidential hotline on 0800 789 321.	Die Abweichung der globalen Land- und Ozeantemperatur vom Durchschnitt für Mai 2018 war die vierthöchste für den Monat Mai im globalen NOAA-Temperaturdatensatz, der bis ins Jahr 1880 zurückreicht. Die globalen Temperaturen von März bis Mai und seit Jahresbeginn waren ebenfalls die viertwärmste derartige Perioden seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen. Diese monatliche Zusammenfassung, die von Wissenschaftlern der National Centers for Environmental Information der NOAA entwickelt wurde, ist Teil der Reihe von Klimadiensten, die die NOAA Regierungen, Unternehmen, Hochschulen und der Öffentlichkeit zur Unterstützung einer fundierten Entscheidungsfindung anbietet. Temperatur im Mai 2018 Die Temperatur im Mai auf den globalen Land- und Meeresoberflächen lag 1,44 °F über dem Durchschnitt des 20. Jahrhunderts von 58,6 °F und war die vierthöchste für den Mai in den Aufzeichnungen von 1880-2018. Die Jahre 2014-2018 gehören zu den fünf wärmsten Mais seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen, wobei 2016 mit 1,58 °F über dem Durchschnitt der wärmste Mai ist. Der Mai 2018 markiert auch den 42. Mai in Folge und den 401. Monat in Folge mit Temperaturen, zumindest nominell, über dem Durchschnitt des 20. Jahrhunderts. Rekordwärme wurde in Teilen Nordamerikas, Europas und Asiens sowie im Atlantik, Pazifik und Indischen Ozean beobachtet. Rekordkalte Temperaturen im Mai beschränkten sich auf den Nordosten Kanadas und den Nordatlantik vor der Südküste Grönlands. Die weltweit gemittelte Landoberflächentemperatur im Mai lag 2,05 °F über dem Durchschnitt des 20. Jahrhunderts von 52,0 °F. Dieser Wert war die kleinste Temperaturabweichung im Mai vom Durchschnitt seit 2011 und verband sich mit 2013 als die siebthöchste Mai-Landtemperatur in der 139-jährigen Aufzeichnung. Die bemerkenswertesten Abweichungen der warmen Landtemperatur vom Durchschnitt im Mai 2018 waren in weiten Teilen der angrenzenden USA und Europas zu beobachten, wo die Temperaturen 5,4 °F über dem Durchschnitt oder höher lagen. Im Gegensatz dazu waren die bemerkenswertesten Abweichungen der kühlen Landtemperatur vom Durchschnitt im Nordosten Kanadas und in Zentralrussland zu beobachten, wo die Temperaturen 5,4 °F unter dem Durchschnitt oder darunter lagen. Europa hatte seinen wärmsten Mai seit Beginn der kontinentalen Aufzeichnungen im Jahr 1910 mit 4,97 ° F über dem Durchschnitt und übertraf damit den vorherigen Rekord aus dem Jahr 2003 um 1,66 ° F. Mai 2018 war das erste Mal im Mai, dass die kontinentale Temperaturabweichung vom Durchschnitt 3,6 °F (2,0 °C) oder mehr betrug. Mehrere europäische Länder hatten eine rekordverdächtige oder fast rekordverdächtige warme Maitemperatur. Asien hatte die kleinste Temperaturabweichung im Mai vom Durchschnitt seit 2009. Die weltweit gemittelte Meeresoberflächentemperatur im Mai lag 1,19 °F über dem monatlichen Durchschnitt des 20. Jahrhunderts von 61,3 °F – auch die vierthöchste globale Meerestemperatur für Mai seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen. Die Jahre 2014-2018 gehören zu den fünf wärmsten Mais seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen, wobei 2016 mit 1,39 °F über dem Durchschnitt der wärmste Mai ist. Mai 2018 Meereis. Laut einer Analyse des National Snow and Ice Data Center(link is external) war die durchschnittliche arktische Meereisausdehnung im Mai mit 420.000 Quadratmeilen (8,1 Prozent) unter dem Durchschnitt von 1981-2010 die zweitkleinste in den 40-Jahres-Aufzeichnungen Daten von NOAA und NASA. Nur die arktische Meereisausdehnung im Mai 2016 war kleiner. Die rekordverdächtig geringe Ausdehnung des arktischen Meereises war hauptsächlich auf das weit unterdurchschnittliche Meereis in der Bering- und Tschuktschensee zurückzuführen. Die Ausdehnung des antarktischen Meereises lag im Mai 330.000 Quadratmeilen (8,6 Prozent) unter dem Durchschnitt von 1981-2010, der drittkleinsten Mai-Ausdehnung seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen. Das antarktische Meereis dehnt sich im Mai überdurchschnittlich schnell aus, wobei Teile des Weddellmeeres weiterhin unterdurchschnittlich mit Eis bedeckt sind. Saisonal (März-Mai 2018). Die Durchschnittstemperatur von März bis Mai über den globalen Land- und Meeresoberflächen lag 1,48 °F über dem Durchschnitt des 20. Jahrhunderts von 56,7 °F und war die vierthöchste für März-Mai in den Aufzeichnungen von 1880-2018. Dieser Wert war 0,45 °F kühler als das Rekordhoch von 2016 und war die kleinste Abweichung der März-Mai-Temperatur vom Durchschnitt seit 2014. Rekordwarme Temperaturen während des Dreimonatszeitraums waren in Teilen Südeuropas, im Nahen Osten und im Nordosten zu beobachten Afrika, China, Mongolei, Südamerika und Atlantik, Indischer und Pazifischer Ozean. Kein Land- oder Ozeangebiet hatte von März bis Mai 2018 Kälterekordtemperaturen. Die weltweit gemittelte Landoberflächentemperatur für März bis Mai lag 2,34 °F über dem Durchschnitt des 20. Jahrhunderts von 46,4 °F. Dieser Wert war der fünfthöchste für März-Mai in der 139-jährigen Aufzeichnung. Fünf Kontinente hatten eine Temperatur von März bis Mai 2018, die zu den neun wärmsten Perioden dieser Art seit Beginn der kontinentalen Aufzeichnungen im Jahr 1910 zählte. Bemerkenswert ist, dass Europa und Südamerika ihren drittwärmsten März bis Mai seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen hatten. Die globale durchschnittliche Meeresoberflächentemperatur von März bis Mai lag 1,15 °F über dem Durchschnitt des 20. Jahrhunderts von 61,0 °F – auch die vierthöchste für März bis Mai in den Aufzeichnungen. Seit Jahresbeginn (Januar-Mai 2018). Die seit Jahresbeginn gemessene Temperatur auf den globalen Land- und Meeresoberflächen lag 1,39 °F über dem Durchschnitt des 20. Jahrhunderts von 55,5 °F – was mit 2010 als vierthöchstem Januar-Mai in der 139-jährigen Aufzeichnung übereinstimmt. Der Jahreswert von 2018 lag 0,59 °F unter dem Rekordhoch von 2016. Die weltweit gemittelte Landoberflächentemperatur seit Jahresbeginn lag 2,18 °F über dem Durchschnitt des 20. Jahrhunderts von 42,8 °F. Dieser Wert war zusammen mit 2002 der fünfthöchste für Januar-Mai in der Aufzeichnung. Die seit Jahresbeginn weltweit gemittelte Meeresoberflächentemperatur lag 1,08 °F über dem Durchschnitt des 20. Jahrhunderts von 60,8 °F. Dies war auch der fünfthöchste für Januar-Mai in der Aufzeichnung von 1880-2018.	true
238ef94f	"Nach dem kürzlich erfolgten Rücktritt des Direktors des Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub Jr., hat die Trump-Administration unerwartet einen weiteren Rücktritt akzeptiert: die Chefköchin des Weißen Hauses, Lisa Mead. Berichten zufolge hat Mead beschlossen, zurückzutreten, weil Präsident Donald Trump ihre kulinarischen Talente in der ganzen Zeit, in der er im Weißen Haus lebt, nicht einmal genutzt hat. „Es ist irgendwie verrückt, weil Lisa so eine gute Köchin ist“, sagte Kurt Reno, der Assistent des Weißen Hauses, der Frau Mead für den Job empfohlen hatte. „Aber Lisa fühlt sich beleidigt, weil der Präsident buchstäblich für jede einzelne Mahlzeit, die er in D.C. gegessen hat, Fast Food bestellt hat. Die einzige Aufgabe, die Lisa in den letzten sechs Monaten mit Essen zu tun hatte, war, Trumps Bestellungen aus Drive-Through-Fenstern abzurufen und das Eis des Präsidenten zu schöpfen aus dem Karton.“ Mr. Trumps bevorzugte Fast-Food-Gerichte sind Berichten zufolge Kentucky Fried Chicken und McDonalds, und er isst sein Brathähnchen, seine Burger und Pommes mit Messer und Gabel, so ein Mitarbeiter des Weißen Hauses, der um Anonymität bat, um Konsequenzen durch das Durchsickern der Essgewohnheiten des Präsidenten zu vermeiden zur Presse. ""Es ist grenzwertig gruselig"", sagte der Mitarbeiter. „Das erste, was Trump mit seinem Brathähnchen macht, ist, die ganze Haut von jedem Stück abzureißen, als würde er die Hühner mit einem Skalpell oder so sezieren, und dann legt er alles auf einen Haufen. Dann schneidet er das magere Fleisch ab und wirft es weg, wobei nur die Fettstücke übrig bleiben, die er dann einzeln mit Stücken der abgezogenen knusprigen Haut isst. Es muss ein Warnzeichen für einen Serienmörder oder so etwas sein.“ Mr. Trumps McDonalds-Gewohnheiten sind sogar noch seltsamer. „Er bestellt jedes Mal das Gleiche“, sagte der Mitarbeiter. „Er bestellt zwei Big Macs, einen großen Braten, natürlich eine Diät-Cola und einen M&M McFlurry, den er Lisa ausgraben und alle braunen M&Ms entfernen lässt, und dann lässt er sie die Hälfte des Eis wegschütten und wieder auffüllen mit extra M&M's. Dann schneidet er Stücke seiner Big Macs ab und taucht sie in den McFlurry, damit jeder Bissen Eiscreme und Schokolade darauf hat. Er taucht seine Pommes, immer noch mit einer Gabel, in die Cola Light, als wäre es eine Würze. Der Anblick wird nie normal. Als der japanische Premierminister Shinzo Abe diese Routine sah, übergab er sich.“ Kein Wunder, dass Chefkoch Lisa Mead aufhörte. Die Halfway Post wünscht ihr viel Glück für ihre zukünftigen Unternehmungen. (Foto mit freundlicher Genehmigung von Shelby Bell.)

28ee11a1	"Guy Boulton von The Journal Sentinel schrieb am 1. Januar, als er den Krankenversicherungsaustausch von Obamacare beschrieb: „Der Austausch könnte Verbrauchern und kleinen Unternehmen helfen, konkurrierende Krankenversicherungspläne zu vergleichen“ und „sie könnten auch den Preiswettbewerb verstärken, indem sie von den Krankenversicherern verlangen, standardisiertere Pläne anzubieten und indem wir den Verbrauchern bessere Informationen darüber geben, was sie kaufen."" Versicherungsbörsen auf dem freien Markt des privaten Sektors existieren bereits ohne staatliche Eingriffe oder Subventionen der Steuerzahler. Wenn Sie „Krankenversicherungsangebot“ googeln, finden Sie eine Reihe von Optionen. Es gibt Dutzende von Unternehmen und Hunderte von Planoptionen mit unterschiedlichen monatlichen Kosten, je nach Plandesign. Ich habe eine davon verwendet, um eine Versicherung für meine Familie abzuschließen, und Millionen anderer Menschen haben sie ebenfalls verwendet. Sie arbeiten ohne staatliche Beteiligung. Der eigentliche Grund für die Schaffung staatlich betriebener Börsen ist die Ausweitung von Medicaid und staatlich subventionierten Versicherungen. Wie wird das Einkommen oder die Familiengröße auf einer Website überprüft? Dieses Konzept ist reif für Betrug und Missbrauch. Und die Subventionen sind so großzügig, dass vierköpfige Familien, die bis zu 89.000 US-Dollar verdienen, Anspruch auf Subventionen der Steuerzahler haben. Unser Land kann sich dieses teure Programm nicht leisten. Unser Land gibt mit einer schnellen und unhaltbaren Rate von jährlich 1,3 Billionen US-Dollar mehr als den Steuereinnahmen zu viel aus. Die Bundesverschuldung beträgt 15 Billionen Dollar (und wächst) und ist jetzt mehr als das jährliche Bruttoinlandsprodukt. Wenn wir pleite sind und zu viel ausgeben, macht es keinen Sinn, 75 % der Menschen in Mississippi oder mehr als die Hälfte der Privatversicherten in Wisconsin zu subventionieren. Diejenigen, die auf einen staatlichen oder bundesstaatlichen Krankenversicherungsaustausch in Wisconsin drängen, haben die Menschen in die Irre geführt, indem sie ihnen sagten, dass dies sowohl für die Verbraucher als auch für die Steuerzahler zu Kosteneinsparungen führen würde. Ein staatlicher Austausch wird die Kosten sowohl für Verbraucher als auch für Steuerzahler erheblich erhöhen. Diejenigen, die etwas anderes sagen, mögen ihre eigenen Interessen im Auge haben, aber sicherlich nicht die von Wisconsin und seinen Bürgern. Eine Millionen-Dollar-Studie, die von der Regierung des ehemaligen Gouverneurs Jim Doyle in Auftrag gegeben wurde, sagte uns, dass nach Obamacare die Kosten für fast 90 % der Versicherten um mehr als 30 % steigen werden. Wegen Obamacare werden etwa 100.000 Wisconsiniter ihre private Versicherung verlieren, die sie jetzt haben, und gezwungen sein, eine neue Versicherung abzuschließen. Schließlich könnte der Oberste Gerichtshof der USA Obamacare stürzen, und die Wahlen im November könnten zur Aufhebung oder Reform des Gesetzes führen. Der Regierungsaustausch muss erst im Januar 2014 aktiv sein. Nachdem der Oberste Gerichtshof und die Wähler Stellung genommen haben, bleibt dem Staat genügend Zeit zum Handeln. Viele andere Bundesstaaten warten auf das Ergebnis des Obersten Gerichtshofs und der Wahlen. Es gibt echte Börsen auf dem freien Markt, und der Wettbewerb, den sie erzeugen, führt zu positiven Ergebnissen. Eine von der Regierung betriebene Obamacare-Börse ist trügerisch, schlecht durchdacht und eine teure Regierungserweiterung, die sich unsere Nation derzeit oder in naher Zukunft nicht leisten kann. Denken Sie daran, dass die überwiegende Mehrheit der Bürger die beste Gesundheitsversorgung der Welt hat. Wirklich arme Menschen haben bereits Medicaid (kostenlose, vom Steuerzahler bezahlte Gesundheitsversorgung), und ältere Menschen haben Medicare. Die Bestimmungen von Obamacare werden nur die Versicherungs- und Steuerzahlerkosten erhöhen. Wisconsin sollte bis zum letztmöglichen Moment nicht an diesem kostspieligen Bundesprogramm teilnehmen.

74adcdf1	"David Cameron bestand heute darauf, dass „ein paar zusätzliche Bomben und Raketen“ die Situation in Syrien nicht verändern würden, drängte aber darauf, dass Großbritannien sich den Luftangriffen gegen ISIS anschließt. Der Premierminister sagte, es mache keinen Sinn, dass die RAF eine internationale Grenze respektieren müsse, die von Dschihad-Fanatikern, die Angriffe auf Großbritannien planen, nicht mehr anerkannt werde. Frankreich, das letzte Nacht eine Reihe „massiver“ Luftangriffe auf ISIS in Syrien gestartet hat, hat gesagt, es würde „geschätzt“, wenn sich Großbritannien dem Kampf anschließen würde. Herr Cameron warnte jedoch, er müsse noch genügend Abgeordnete überzeugen, um sicherzustellen, dass eine Abstimmung über Militäraktionen nicht von Labour-Führer Jeremy Corbyn abgelehnt wurde, der heute sagte, dies könne „mehr Chaos und mehr Verluste“ bringen. RAF-Tornados führen Bombenangriffe gegen ISIS im Irak durch, aber David Cameron muss noch Unterstützung im Parlament für Militäraktionen im benachbarten Syrien aufbauen. Auf einer Pressekonferenz auf dem G20-Gipfel in der Türkei bestand David Cameron heute darauf, dass „ein paar zusätzliche Bomben und Raketen werden die Situation in Syrien nicht verändern Nach den tödlichen Waffen- und Bombenangriffen in Paris warfen 10 französische Jets 20 Bomben auf die ISIS-Hauptstadt Raqqa, zerstörten eine zentrale Kommandozentrale, ein Trainingslager und ein Munitionsdepot und zerstörten die Stadt in Panik. Das Bombardement erfolgte nur zwei Tage, nachdem Präsident Francois Hollande die koordinierten Angriffe in Paris, bei denen bis zu 129 Menschen getötet wurden, als „Kriegshandlung“ bezeichnet und versprochen hatte, ISIS in Syrien „ohne Gnade“ zu treffen. Die Jets wurden in Abstimmung mit den US-Streitkräften von Standorten in Jordanien und am Persischen Golf gestartet. Frankreichs Außenminister Laurent Fabius sagte, sein Land sei berechtigt, in Syrien aktiv zu werden. „Es war normal, die Initiative zu ergreifen und zu handeln, und Frankreich hatte die Legitimität dazu. Wir haben es bereits in der Vergangenheit getan, wir haben heute neue Luftangriffe in Raqqa durchgeführt, sagte Fabius. ""Man kann nicht hart angegriffen werden, und Sie kennen das Drama, das in Paris passiert, ohne präsent und aktiv zu sein."" Großbritannien beteiligt sich jedoch nicht an der Aktion in Syrien, weil sich die Abgeordneten bisher geweigert haben, die Ausweitung der Luftangriffe im benachbarten Irak zu genehmigen. Herr Cameron wurde 2013 gedemütigt, als sich Tory-Rebellen mit Labour zusammenschlossen, um einen Plan für Raketenangriffe gegen das Assad-Regime abzulehnen. Es spricht viel dafür, zu sagen, dass Isil nicht an der irakisch-syrischen Grenze Halt macht, und deshalb sollten wir Premierminister David Cameron auch nicht. Es zwang den Premierminister zu einem peinlichen Rückzug und beschädigte die Beziehungen zu US-Präsident Barack Obama, der es alleine schaffen musste Jets in den syrischen Luftraum zu schicken. Die öffentliche Empörung über die Anschläge von Paris und die umfassendere Flüchtlingskrise, die durch den Aufstieg des IS angeheizt wurde, hat das Thema jedoch wieder auf den Tisch gebracht. Auf einer Pressekonferenz auf dem G20-Gipfel in der Türkei sagte Herr Cameron: „Es gibt sehr starke Argumente dafür, zu sagen, dass Isil nicht an der irakisch-syrischen Grenze Halt macht und wir es daher auch nicht tun sollten, aber ich erkenne an, dass ich es tun muss mehr, um dieses Argument aufzubauen, diesen Fall aufzubauen, das Parlament mitzunehmen. „Ich denke, die Leute wollen wissen, dass es einen ganzen Plan für die Zukunft Syriens gibt, die Zukunft der Region, denn es ist vollkommen richtig zu sagen, dass ein paar zusätzliche Bomben und Raketen die Situation nicht verändern werden. „Wie der Generalsekretär der Vereinten Nationen es vor einigen Jahren ausdrückte: ‚Eine Rakete kann einen Terroristen töten, aber nur eine gute Regierung und eine gute Regierungsführung können den Terrorismus töten'. Das brauchen wir.“ David Cameron, der heute den russischen Präsidenten Wladimir Putin getroffen hat, um auf eine politische Lösung der Krise in Syrien zu drängen, warnte davor, dass es keinen Sinn mache, die Streiks nicht über eine Grenze auszudehnen, die ISIS selbst nicht anerkennt. Herr Cameron hat wiederholt deutlich gemacht, dass er davon überzeugt ist macht keinen Sinn, die Streiks nicht über eine Grenze auszudehnen, die ISIS selbst nicht anerkennt. Er sagte gegenüber der Sendung Today von BBC Radio 4: „Ich unterstütze die Aktion in Syrien. Wir sind Teil der Enabler dafür. Es passiert sowieso. Die Frage ist, ob wir weiter gehen sollten, um uns dieser Aktion anzuschließen. „Ich habe immer gesagt, dass ich es für vernünftig halte, dass wir das tun sollten. Der ISIL erkennt keine Grenze zwischen dem Irak und Syrien an und das sollten wir auch nicht. »Aber ich muss das Argument aufbauen. Ich muss es ins Parlament bringen. Ich muss mehr Leute überzeugen.' Er bestand darauf, dass die britische „militärische Hard Power“ im Irak bereits Wirkung entfalte, wo der IS „etwa 25 bis 30 Prozent seines Territoriums verloren“ habe. Britische Streitkräfte, einschließlich Drohnen, waren auch eingesetzt worden, um führende ISIS-Kämpfer zu finden, anzuvisieren und zu töten, die eine direkte Bedrohung für Großbritannien darstellen, darunter der ehemalige Cardiff-Schüler Reyaad Khan, der im August von einer britischen Drohne in Syrien getötet wurde. Britische Geheimdienstflugzeuge waren auch an der Mission beteiligt, den ISIS-Mörder Jihadi John aufzuspüren, der am Donnerstag durch einen amerikanischen Drohnenangriff getötet wurde. Labour-Führer Jeremy Corbyn warnte davor, dass verstärkte Militäraktionen nicht die Lösung der Krise seien, und schloss aus, seinen Abgeordneten eine freie Abstimmung über eine militärische Intervention zu geben über Militäraktionen in Syrien, nachdem er eine freie Abstimmung über die Bombardierung der ISIS-Hochburg ausgeschlossen hatte. Der Labour-Führer sagte gegenüber Sky News: Ich hoffe, dass wir uns auf diese Position einigen können, tatsächlich mit einer Reihe anderer Konservativer, das ist also in der Tat die Position, die ich vertrete. Ich glaube nicht, dass eine kostenlose Abstimmung etwas ist, was wir anbieten. Es bringt ihn auf Kollisionskurs mit Dutzenden von Labour-Abgeordneten, die privat der Meinung sind, dass Großbritannien sein Engagement verstärken sollte. Chris Leslie, ehemaliger Schattenkanzler, sagte: „Wir sollten sicherlich keinem Vorschlag vorgreifen, wie wir die ISIS-Bedrohung angehen oder irgendetwas in diesem Stadium ausschließen können?“ Herr Cameron bestand jedoch darauf, dass er keine Abstimmung im Unterhaus über Maßnahmen in Syrien erzwingen würde, es sei denn, er sei sicher, dass er gewinnen könne. „Wir werden diese Abstimmung nicht abhalten, es sei denn, wir sehen, dass das Parlament diese Aktion unterstützen würde, denn ein Scheitern wäre schädlich – es geht nicht darum, der Regierung zu schaden, es geht darum, unserem Land und seinem Ruf in der Welt nicht zu schaden . „Also werde ich den Fall aufbauen, aber am Ende muss das Parlament entscheiden. „Ich habe dem Parlament das Versprechen gegeben, wie es frühere Premierminister getan haben, dass wir uns nicht vorsätzlich zu einer Militäraktion verpflichten werden, ohne eine Abstimmung zu haben. „Natürlich denke ich, dass das britische Militär dem, was in Syrien passiert, größere Wirkung verleihen würde. „Was wir tun sollten, abgesehen davon, dass der Streit nicht an der irakisch-syrischen Grenze aufhört, ist, dass wir auf diese politische Einigung drängen sollten, die uns am Ende eine Regierung in Syrien geben wird, die das kann das gesamte syrische Volk vertreten und unser Verbündeter sein, um die Geißel des islamistischen Terrors auszurotten, der in unseren eigenen Ländern und im Nahen Osten zum Verlust von Menschenleben führt.' Die Tory-Regierung sieht sich jedoch sowohl von Labour als auch von Dutzenden konservativer Abgeordneter mit Widerstand konfrontiert. Labour-Chef Corbyn warnte davor, dass verstärkte Militäraktionen keine Lösung für die Krise seien. Er sagte zu Lorraine von ITV: „Ändert die Bombardierung das? Wahrscheinlich nicht. Die Idee muss sicherlich eine politische Lösung in Syrien sein, die sehr schwer zu erreichen ist. „Es gibt einige Anzeichen dafür, dass die Gespräche am Wochenende Fortschritte gemacht haben – Iran, Russland, USA, Europäische Union, an einem Tisch zusammen mit allen regionalen Regierungen, insbesondere der Türkei ist der Schlüssel. „Aber auch, wer ISIS finanziert, wer ISIS bewaffnet, wer ISIS sichere Zufluchtsorte bietet, um dorthin zu gelangen. „Sie müssen Fragen zu den Waffen stellen, die jeder in der Region verkauft hat, und zur Rolle Saudi-Arabiens dabei. Ich denke, es gibt einige sehr große Fragen, und wir müssen vorsichtig sein. Ein Krieg bringt nicht unbedingt Frieden, er kann oft noch mehr Konflikte und noch mehr Chaos und noch mehr Verluste bringen.' Frankreichs Botschafterin im Vereinigten Königreich, Sylvie Bermann, sagte, es wäre „würdig“, wenn die RAF an der Seite der Franzosen Razzien in Syrien durchführen würde. Sie sagte zu Murnaghan: „Es ist schwierig, dies zu kommentieren, da es sich nicht nur um eine Regierungsentscheidung handelt, sondern sie beschlossen haben, sich mit dem Parlament zu beraten. Wenn sie wie wir mitmachen, werden wir das natürlich zu schätzen wissen, weil wir immer Seite an Seite gekämpft haben, aber es ist ihre Entscheidung.“ Sie fügte hinzu: „Wir müssen Seite an Seite kämpfen, wenn wir den Terrorismus besiegen wollen. “ Der frühere Premierminister Tony Blair forderte Großbritannien letzte Woche vor den Anschlägen von Paris auf, sich den Luftangriffen in Syrien anzuschließen: „Das ist kein großes Geheimnis; Ich denke, es ist wichtig, dass Großbritannien seinen Teil im Kampf gegen diesen abscheulichen Extremismus leistet, der das Leben so vieler Menschen brutalisiert.“ Einer der zehn französischen Kampfjets bereitet sich auf den Start von einem Luftwaffenstützpunkt in den Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten vor. Französische Kampfjets starten eine Welle „massiver“ Luftangriffe auf ISIS in Syrien, als das Land seine „unbarmherzige“ Vergeltung für die Anschläge von Paris begann SIEBEN ANGRIFFE IM LETZTEN JAHR ALS 1.900 SPIES EINGESTELLT WURDEN Großbritannien will weitere 1.900 Spione rekrutieren, um der Bedrohung durch ISIS-Terrorzellen in Syrien entgegenzuwirken. David Cameron enthüllte heute, dass in den letzten 12 Monaten sieben tödliche Pläne, die in Großbritannien Chaos anrichten sollten, verhindert wurden. Aber er warnte davor, dass das Ausmaß und die Schwere der Anschläge in Paris, bei denen 129 Menschen ums Leben kamen, weitaus größer seien als alles, was die Geheimdienste bisher gesehen hätten. Die Sicherheits- und Geheimdienste werden als Reaktion auf die ISIS-Bedrohung, die für die Bombardierung eines russischen Flugzeugs in Ägypten und den Anschlag in Paris in den letzten Wochen verantwortlich gemacht wurde, eine erhebliche Aufstockung der Mittel erhalten. Herr Cameron kündigte eine 15-prozentige Aufstockung der 12.700 Mitarbeiter der Sicherheits- und Geheimdienste MI5, MI6 und GCHQ mit der Einstellung von weiteren 1.900 Mitarbeitern an. In der Zwischenzeit werden die Ausgaben für die Luftsicherheit auf mindestens das Doppelte der derzeitigen 9 Millionen Pfund pro Jahr steigen. Der Premierminister sagte, Großbritannien befinde sich in einem „Generationenkampf“ gegen extremistischen Terror. Die zusätzlichen Ausgaben werden dazu beitragen, „diejenigen zu bekämpfen, die uns und unsere Werte zerstören würden“, und es den Briten ermöglichen, „unsere Lebensweise, die uns so am Herzen liegt, fortzusetzen“. Er sagte gegenüber der Sendung Today von BBC Radio 4: „Mir sind diese Zellen bekannt, die in Syrien operieren und Menschen in unserem eigenen Land radikalisieren und möglicherweise Menschen zurückschicken, um Anschläge zu verüben. ""Unsere Sicherheitsdienste haben in den letzten sechs Monaten sieben Angriffe gestoppt, wenn auch in kleinerem Umfang."" Downing Street stellte später klar, dass die Zahl für das letzte Jahr war. Pläne, wie auf einen Maroding Gun-Angriff im Pariser Stil reagiert werden soll, wurden im Zuge der Pariser Gräueltaten überprüft, die eine Veränderung in der Art der ISIS-Anschläge markierten. »Es hätte hier passieren können«, sagte Mr. Cameron. „Nach den entsetzlichen Anschlägen in Paris stehen wir in völliger Solidarität mit Frankreich. Tory-Abgeordneter Crispin Blunt, der Vorsitzende des Ausschusses für auswärtige Angelegenheiten des Unterhauses, sagte, eine Bombenkampagne der RAF in Syrien sei ein „ineffektiver Schritt“, weil „sie nicht Teil eines kohärenten internationalen Plans wäre, um unsere Mission zu erfüllen, die die Niederlage ist von Isis'. Herr Blunt sagte gegenüber Sky News: „Ob acht britische Flugzeuge etwas breitere Luftoperationen fliegen sollten oder nicht, wird militärisch nichts ändern, die Franzosen fliegen bereits dorthin, die Amerikaner fliegen bereits die große Anzahl der Missionen dort neben den Russen auch. „Dieses Bild etwas komplexer zu machen, wird das Ergebnis nicht wirklich ändern, und wir müssen uns hier auf das Ergebnis konzentrieren. Was ist die Mission? Die Mission ist es, Isis zu besiegen, wir werden die Ideologie nicht sofort besiegen, das wird viel länger dauern, aber es ist viel einfacher sicherzustellen, dass wir keine Angriffe wie die, die wir haben, auf uns projizieren können in Paris hätte, wenn Isis das Territorium nicht kontrolliert und es keinen Ort gibt, an den Menschen, welcher Art auch immer, gehen und für sie kämpfen könnten. ""Dieses Territorium muss ihnen weggenommen werden, wir müssen uns darüber einigen, wie das geht."" Labour unter Herrn Corbyn hat geschworen, sich einer Ausweitung des britischen Engagements zu widersetzen, und fordert eine „friedliche“ Lösung des Konflikts. Die kompromisslose Haltung birgt jedoch die Gefahr, dass er zunehmend mit Wählern in Konflikt gerät, die entsetzt über die Anschläge von Paris sind. Shadow-Außenministerin Hilary Benn sagte gegenüber Sky News, es sei nicht möglich, „Isil in Syrien nur durch Bombenabwürfe zu besiegen“. Diane Abbott, Schattenministerin für internationale Entwicklung, sagte, Labour werde einer Ausweitung der Militäraktion auf Syrien nur dann zustimmen, wenn es ein UN-Mandat dafür gebe. Nach den Terroranschlägen von Paris sprach Diane Abbott, Schattenministerin für internationale Entwicklung, und skizzierte die Umstände, die erforderlich sein werden, damit ihre Partei einen Antrag unterstützen kann, die militärische Rolle des Vereinigten Königreichs vom Irak auf Syrien auszudehnen. Sie sagte Murnaghan in Sky News: „Was die Politik von Labour in Bezug auf Syrien betrifft, haben wir dies tatsächlich auf dem Parteitag diskutiert und wir haben eine Politik. ""Wir können uns darauf einigen, Syrien zunächst zu bombardieren, wenn es eine UN-Resolution gibt und auch, und das ist mir ein besonderes Anliegen, wenn es einen Plan gibt, um die Flüchtlinge zu behandeln, die sich aus weiteren Militäraktionen ergeben werden."" Auf die Frage, ob die Anschläge von Paris daran etwas geändert hätten, sagte Frau Abbott: „Ja, es ist ein Game Changer, da es die Notwendigkeit, den Bürgerkrieg in Syrien zu lösen, noch dringender macht als zuvor, und das ist Teil der Politik der Labour Party , dass wir die Notwendigkeit einer diplomatischen Lösung des syrischen Bürgerkriegs ganz oben auf die Tagesordnung setzen.'"

Januar 2020 – Am Montag beschuldigten die Bundesanwälte den ehemaligen Senator Martin Sandoval der Annahme von Bestechungsgeldern im Austausch gegen Gesetze, die der Rotlichtkameraindustrie schaden würden. Sie beschuldigten ihn auch, eine falsche Einkommensteuererklärung eingereicht zu haben. Der schweigsame Sean Casten versäumte es erneut, sich gegen seine Parteibosse in Illinois zu behaupten. Genauso wie er sich weigerte, sich gegen Mike Madigan und seine Kumpane zu behaupten, als bekannt wurde, dass sie angeblich eine Vergewaltigung vertuschten und eine Kultur des Missbrauchs in Springfield förderten, hat Casten nichts über Marty Sandovals Bestechungsänderungen gesagt. Als Sandoval bei einer Spendenaktion im 6. Bezirk ein Attentat auf den Präsidenten inszenierte, sagte Casten nichts. Dennoch forderte er die Amtsenthebung des republikanischen Präsidenten, bevor der Mueller-Bericht überhaupt veröffentlicht wurde. Und er hätte nicht schneller sein können, um die Amtsenthebung des konservativen Richters am Obersten Gerichtshof, Brett Kavanaugh, wegen völlig falscher Anschuldigungen hochzuspielen. Dann dreht sich Casten um und sagt einer Gruppe von Wählern: „Weil wir immer noch eine Nation sind, in der die Mehrheit der Menschen für Hillary Clinton gestimmt hat, sind wir immer noch eine Nation, in der die Mehrheit gute Menschen sind.“ Die Karriere von Hillary Clinton ist mit Abstand einer der am besten dokumentierten Fälle politischer Korruption in der amerikanischen Geschichte. „Nun, ich verstehe, dass Sean Casten sich vielleicht ein wenig verlegen fühlt, wenn er den Steuerbetrug eines anderen Demokraten kommentiert, da kürzlich bekannt wurde, dass Casten selbst Steuerbetrug begangen hat“, sagte Jeanne Ives. „Korruption zu ignorieren und sich zu weigern, Ihre Plattform zu nutzen, um Fehlverhalten aufzudecken, mag Sie bei Parteibossen in der Gunst halten, aber es macht Sie auch mitschuldig an der Missbrauchskultur Ihrer Partei. Schlimmer noch: Mit der Energie von 1.000 solarbetriebenen Windmühlen den Missetaten der politischen Gegner nachzugehen und dabei die gravierenden Probleme in der eigenen Partei zu ignorieren, macht einen zu einem erbitterten Parteigänger.“ Als Staatsvertreter sprach sich Ives gegen die Kultur der Vetternwirtschaft und des Missbrauchs von Sprecherin Madigan aus. Aber sie hat sich auch gegen die Republikaner gewehrt, als sie unausgeglichene Haushalte, Steuererhöhungen und Rettungsaktionen verabschiedeten. „Als Gesetzgeber wird Ihnen zugetraut, für die Menschen, die Sie vertreten, gegen immer mächtigere Politiker und Parteiführer einzustehen“, sagte Ives. „Das ist jetzt deine Party, Sean Casten.

b4b6057f	"TEILEN Madison – Der Vorschlag von Gouverneur Scott Walker, die Finanzierung von Gutschein- und öffentlichen Charterschulen zu erhöhen, sowie sein Plan, einen neuen Finanzierungsstrom zu schaffen, um Kindern mit besonderen Bedürfnissen den Besuch von Privatschulen zu ermöglichen, wurde am Sonntag sofort von der größten Lehrergewerkschaft des Staates kritisiert. Befürworter öffentlicher Schulen und eine große Gruppe für Behindertenrechte. Laut Finanzierungsvorschlägen, die am Sonntag vom Büro des Gouverneurs vorgestellt wurden, stellt Walker Geld zur Verfügung, das als Anreizzahlungen für Lehrer und Schulen verwendet werden könnte, basierend darauf, wie gut die Schulen auf staatlichen Zeugnissen abschneiden. Walker wird der Legislative am Mittwoch eine bescheidene Erhöhung – etwa 1 % – der Mittel für öffentliche Schulen in Wisconsin in seinem Haushalt vorschlagen, zwei Jahre nachdem seine steilen Kürzungen und die vollständige Abschaffung von Tarifverhandlungen für Lehrer die erfolglose Bewegung zur Abberufung von Walker aus dem Amt ausgelöst hatten . Tom Beebe, Projektleiter von Opportunity to Learn Wisconsin, einer liberal gesinnten Gruppe und ehemaliger Geschäftsführer der Wisconsin Alliance for Excellent Schools, hat Walkers Kürzungen im Bildungsbereich kritisiert. Er sagte, die für diesen nächsten Zweijahreshaushalt vorgeschlagene Erhöhung der allgemeinen Hilfe - 129,2 Millionen Dollar über zwei Jahre - belaufe sich nur auf etwa 161 Dollar für jeden der 800.000 öffentlichen Schüler in Wisconsin. „Wenn die Einnahmenobergrenze nicht erhöht wird, geht kein neues Geld an die Schulen, egal wie viel Hilfe erhöht wird“, sagte Beebe. ""Die Erhöhung der Schulfinanzierung geht einfach an die Grundsteuerzahler, nicht an die Klassenzimmer."" Mary Bell, Präsidentin des Wisconsin Education Association Council, der größten Lehrergewerkschaft des Bundesstaates, sagte, die bescheidene Erhöhung habe eigentlich nur dafür gesorgt, dass die Gesamteinnahmen der Schulen stagnierten. „Die stagnierenden Einnahmen zusätzlich zu den größten Kürzungen der Bildungsfinanzierung in der Geschichte von Wisconsin im letzten Haushalt sind ein weiterer klarer Hinweis darauf, dass dieser Gouverneur nicht die Absicht hat, Schulen in der Nachbarschaft zu unterstützen“, sagte Bell in einer Erklärung. „(Walkers) wirklicher Fokus liegt auf der Privatisierung der öffentlichen Bildung mit einer weiteren Infusion von Ressourcen in das nicht rechenschaftspflichtige, vom Steuerzahler finanzierte Gutscheinprogramm für Privatschulen, während unsere öffentlichen Schulen in der Nachbarschaft lebenserhaltend bleiben“, fügte sie hinzu. Die von den Republikanern kontrollierte Legislative wird Walkers Haushalt in den nächsten vier Monaten überprüfen und Änderungen vornehmen, bevor sie irgendwann im Juni darüber abstimmt. Der zweijährige Ausgabenplan tritt im Juli in Kraft. Der Abgeordnete Sondy Pope, ranghöchster Demokrat im Bildungsausschuss der Versammlung, sagte, Walkers Vorschlag sei nicht genug. Bei der Höhe der staatlichen Beihilfen für öffentliche Schulen würde es 12 Jahre dauern, um das im letzten Haushalt verlorene Geld zu ersetzen, sagte sie. Walker behauptet, dass die Schulen Geld sparen konnten, weil das Tarifvertragsgesetz auch von den Lehrern verlangte, mehr zu ihren Renten- und Gesundheitsversorgungsleistungen beizutragen. Die unparteiische Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance berichtete im November, dass diese Leistungskürzungen und die Begrenzung der von den Gewerkschaften ausgehandelten Erhöhungen auf die Inflationsrate etwa zwei Drittel der Kürzungen der Schuleinnahmen im Schuljahr 2011/12 ausgleichen. Papst sagte, die Erhöhung der Hilfe, die Walker vorschlägt, werde nicht ausreichen, um Schulen zu helfen, die kämpfen, um über die Runden zu kommen. „Diese Leute versuchen, die öffentlichen Schulen in Wisconsin auszuhungern“, sagte sie. Der republikanische Senator Luther Olsen, Vorsitzender des Bildungsausschusses des Senats, sagte, er sei froh, dass Walker mehr Geld in die öffentliche Bildung investiere. „Das ist viel besser, als Kürzungen vornehmen zu müssen, wie wir es beim letzten Budget getan haben“, sagte er. ""Es ist nicht so viel, wie ich wollte, aber wir sind froh, dass es nicht negativ oder null ist."" Die Finanzierung von Walker für Schulen umfasst weitere 73 Millionen US-Dollar für Gutscheinschulen, 23 Millionen US-Dollar für Charterschulen und 21 Millionen US-Dollar an Zuschüssen für Schüler mit besonderen Bedürfnissen, um einen Gutschein für den Besuch von Privatschulen zu erhalten. Ein Vorschlag für diese Gutscheine für besondere Bedürfnisse wurde von der Versammlung in der letzten Sitzung trotz breitem Widerstand des staatlichen Ministeriums für öffentlichen Unterricht, von Behindertenrechtsgruppen und der staatlichen Schulbehörde verabschiedet. Es kam nicht durch den Senat. Lisa Pugh, Koordinatorin für öffentliche Politik für Behindertenrechte in Wisconsin, äußerte sich besorgt darüber, dass Gutscheine für besondere Bedürfnisse jetzt als Teil des Haushalts vorgeschlagen würden, da dies eine bedeutende Änderung der Politik in der Art und Weise darstellen würde, wie Schüler mit besonderen Bedürfnissen bedient werden. Und das sollte in den Gesetzgebungsausschüssen für Bildung diskutiert werden, sagte sie. Außerdem hätten die 21 Millionen Dollar für Kinder mit besonderen Bedürfnissen verwendet werden können, um öffentliche Schulen im ganzen Bundesstaat zu unterstützen, nicht nur für die Minderheit der Kinder, die diesen Steuerzahler-Zuschuss für den Besuch einer Privatschule nutzen könnten, sagte sie. Walkers Pläne zur Erweiterung des bekannteren Gutscheinsystems, das das langjährige Programm von Milwaukee und das neue Programm von Racine umfasst, werden mit Spannung erwartet, aber er gab diese Details nicht sofort bekannt. Die Finanzierung des UW-Systems würde 181 Millionen US-Dollar unter dem Budget liegen, zwei Jahre nachdem es um 315 Millionen US-Dollar gekürzt worden war. Die Hilfe für die technische Hochschule würde 5 Millionen US-Dollar erhöhen. UW-Sprecher David Giroux sagte, die erhöhte Finanzierung in Verbindung mit der Befreiung der Universität von sogenannten Fehlern, die zu Kürzungen in Höhe von 66 Millionen US-Dollar hätten führen können, sei „sehr positiv“. „Wir wollen eine stärkere Belegschaft für Wisconsin schaffen, und neue Investitionen der Steuerzahler sind für diese Bemühungen unerlässlich“, sagte Giroux. „Es sieht so aus, als würden wir genug Mittel haben, um das heutige Niveau des Zugangs zu und der Qualität von Hochschulen aufrechtzuerhalten, zusammen mit neuen Investitionen in UW-Programme, die sich auf die Schaffung von Arbeitsplätzen konzentrieren. Das ist eine kluge Investition.“ Walker stellt 64 Millionen US-Dollar an Anreizzahlungen für K-12-Schulen zur Verfügung, die an ihre Noten auf landesweiten Zeugnissen gebunden sind. Davon würden 24 Millionen US-Dollar an Schulen mit der Note A oder B gehen, 30 Millionen US-Dollar würden an Schulen gehen, die auf den Zeugnissen ein gewisses Maß an Verbesserung aufweisen, und 10 Millionen US-Dollar würden den leistungsschwächsten Bezirken einmalig zur Verfügung stehen gewähren, wenn sie einen akzeptablen Verbesserungsplan vorlegen. Brian Pleva, Lobbyist der American Federation for Children Wisconsin, einer konservativen Gruppe, lobte Walkers Erhöhung der Finanzierung von Gutscheinen und Charterschulen, weil sie Eltern mit niedrigem Einkommen und der Mittelschicht mehr Bildungsmöglichkeiten bieten würden. Er sagte auch, dass Stipendien für besondere Bedürfnisse einer Minderheit von Familien helfen würden, für die die örtlichen öffentlichen Schulen die Bedürfnisse ihrer Kinder nicht erfüllen. Walker sagte in einer Erklärung am Sonntag, dass die Budgetvorschläge Erfolge belohnen und den Schulen Anreize bieten werden, um Leistung und Rechenschaftspflicht zu fördern. In diesem nächsten Zweijahreshaushalt würde die Gesamtfinanzierung der K-12 laut AP um 276 Millionen US-Dollar steigen. Aber Walker wird die Einnahmengrenzen nicht aufheben und sagte, er sei besorgt über Schritte, die zu einer Erhöhung der Grundsteuern führen könnten. Die vorgeschlagene Erhöhung der Hilfe für Schulen erfolgt, nachdem Walker die allgemeine Schulhilfe vor zwei Jahren um 834 Millionen US-Dollar gekürzt hat, was einem Rückgang von mehr als 8 % gegenüber der vorherigen Finanzierungsperiode entspricht. Um die Schulbehörden daran zu hindern, Grundsteuern zu erheben, um den Rückgang der Schulbeihilfe auszugleichen, schlug der Gouverneur vor, die Befugnis der Distrikte zur Begrenzung der Einnahmen – den kombinierten Betrag, den sie an lokalen Grundsteuern und staatlicher allgemeiner Schulbeihilfe erheben können – um 5,5 % zu reduzieren. Infolgedessen sank die durchschnittliche Schuleinnahmengrenze pro Schüler von 2010 bis 2011 um etwa 555 US-Dollar im Jahr 2011/12 von 10.100 US-Dollar. Über diese Geschichte Scott Bauer, der für The Associated Press in Madison berichtet, und Erin Richards vom Journal Sentinel-Team, die in Milwaukee berichtet, haben diesen Bericht zusammengestellt."

Sie starb zwei Tage nach Verabreichung des Impfstoffs, teilten die Behörden mit und fügten hinzu, dass eine Untersuchung der Todesursache eingeleitet wurde. Eine Erklärung der Forscher besagte, dass Elisa wenige Stunden nach der Einnahme des Impfstoffs Komplikationen hatte und bei der Aufnahme starb. Elisa Granato, eine Wissenschaftlerin, war eine der beiden, die den Stich erhielt. Vier weitere Freiwillige sollen mit Komplikationen aufgrund von Nebenwirkungen des Impfstoffs kämpfen. Beamte sagen, dass die vier Personen auf Nebenwirkungen des Impfstoffs überwacht werden. Nachdem sie ihre Spritze gemacht hatte, sagte Elisa Granato der BBC: „Ich bin Wissenschaftlerin, also wollte ich versuchen, den wissenschaftlichen Prozess zu unterstützen, wo immer ich kann.“ Forscher, die auf die Durchführung einer Autopsie warten, glauben, dass Elisa einen zugrunde liegenden Gesundheitszustand hatte, der den Gesundheitsbehörden nicht mitgeteilt wurde. „Die vier unter kritischen Bedingungen werden in Ordnung sein, und dies sind erwartete Reaktionen der Impfstoffe, daher eine Studie.“ Die Forscher enthüllten und fügten hinzu, dass diese Beobachtungen dazu beitragen würden, den Impfstoff zu verbessern, bevor er für die Verwendung durch die Öffentlichkeit verfügbar wird.	in	false

25aa97f1	Viele Demokraten krähen, dass die 82. Legislaturperiode als eine untergehen wird, in der trotz des „Notfall“-Vorstoßes für die Gesetzgebung zu Zufluchtsstädten nichts aus dem Kapitol hervorgegangen ist, das die Art und Weise, wie Einwanderungsgesetze durchgesetzt werden, wesentlich verändert. Dennoch gelang es den Republikanern, während der Sondersitzung einen kleinen Sieg zu erringen, indem sie dem Senatsgesetz 1, dem Must-Pass-Gesetz zu Steuerangelegenheiten, erfolgreich eine Sprache beifügten, die von Personen verlangen würde, die einen Führerschein oder andere staatlich ausgestellte Ausweise beantragen, um sie nachzuweisen. re im Land legal. Eine solche Richtlinie, im Gegensatz zu einem Gesetz über die Bücher, war seit 2008 in Kraft, als das texanische Ministerium für öffentliche Sicherheit begann, von Antragstellern für Führerscheine und Personalausweise zu verlangen, dass sie von der Regierung ausgestellte Dokumente vorlegen, die ihren rechtlichen Status bestätigen. Vor 2008 war laut DPS-Sprecherin Tela Mange ein solcher Nachweis nicht erforderlich, um eine Lizenz oder einen Ausweis zu erhalten. Einwanderungsrechtsgruppen waren wütend über die Änderung der Politik, die ihrer Meinung nach dazu führen könnte, dass rechtmäßigen Einwohnern der Zugang zu diesen Ausweisformen verweigert wird, wobei DPS-Angestellte de facto als Einwanderungsagenten fungieren. Im Jahr 2009 verklagte der mexikanisch-amerikanische Rechtsschutz- und Bildungsfonds DPS mit dem Argument, dass die Behörde ihre Befugnisse durch die Umsetzung der Richtlinie überschritten habe, obwohl der Gesetzgeber in der Sitzung von 2007 eine ähnliche Gesetzgebung abgelehnt habe. Letzten Monat jedoch nahm der Vorsitzende des Repräsentantenhauses, Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, die Sache selbst in die Hand. Pitts kopierte die Sprache, die von Bewerbern für Führerscheine und Personalausweise verlangte, ihren rechtmäßigen Wohnsitz nachzuweisen, aus Senat Bill 9, einem Omnibus-Heimatschutzgesetz, das vom staatlichen Senator Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands, eingereicht wurde, und fügte es als Änderung zu SB 1 hinzu Die Änderung ermöglicht es dem DPS auch, Ablaufdaten für diese IDs basierend auf dem Zeitpunkt zu bestimmen, an dem ein Einwanderungsdokument ausgestellt wurde. Für einen Nicht-Staatsbürger oder einen nicht ständigen rechtmäßigen Einwohner kann DPS ein Dokument ausstellen, das „an einem von DPS festgelegten Datum oder dem Ablaufdatum des genehmigten Aufenthalts des Antragstellers in den Vereinigten Staaten abläuft, je nachdem, welches früher ist“. Wenn das Einwanderungsdokument kein Ablaufdatum hat, kann DPS einen Ausweis oder eine Lizenz ausstellen, die jedes Jahr abläuft. Während der gerade abgeschlossenen regulären und Sondersitzungen argumentierte Williams, dass Texas nur einer von drei Staaten sei, die keine Richtlinie zum Rechtsstatus von ID-Antragstellern hätten, und sagte, dass eine solche notwendig sei, um sicherzustellen, dass ausländische Kriminelle keine IDs erhalten. Er wies darauf hin, dass DPS-Mitarbeiter im Rahmen einer Bereitstellung von 64 Millionen US-Dollar für vorübergehende Besucherstationen im nächsten Zweijahreszeitraum geschult werden, um die Dutzende von Einwanderungsdokumenten zu identifizieren und zu genehmigen, die derzeit zur Beantragung von Führerscheinen und Ausweisen verwendet werden. Menschen, die versuchen, ihre bestehenden Lizenzen oder Ausweise zu erneuern, aber keinen sofortigen Zugang zu Pässen oder Geburtsurkunden haben, könnten ebenfalls von dem neuen Gesetz betroffen sein, sagte Mange. Die Pitts-Änderung verlangt, dass sie DPS auch einen Wohnsitz- oder Staatsbürgerschaftsnachweis vorlegen. Mange sagte, die Agentur habe möglicherweise etwas in ihren Akten, das darauf hindeutet, dass ein Antragsteller zuvor einen solchen Nachweis erbracht habe, aber wenn es vor 2008 war, sagte sie, „möchtest du vielleicht etwas mitbringen, nur für den Fall.“ Mange sagte, dass Texaner eine Benachrichtigung von DPS erhalten sollten, wenn es Zeit für eine Verlängerung ist, die sie darüber informiert, ob sie zur Online-Verlängerung berechtigt sind, was nur passieren kann, wenn sie das vorherige Mal nicht online verlängert haben. „Wir verlangen, dass jeder alle 12 Jahre einmal vorbeikommt, damit wir Ihr lächelndes Gesicht sehen können“, sagte sie. Die Maßnahmen des Gesetzgebers könnten ein Ende des Gerichtsverfahrens von 2009 bedeuten. Dennoch stellt MALDEF-Anwalt Luis Figueroa den Zeitpunkt des Amenemnts von Pitts in Frage, der mit der Verabschiedung eines neuen Wähler-ID-Gesetzes zusammenfällt, das die Bürger dazu verpflichtet, vor der Stimmabgabe einen gültigen, staatlich ausgestellten Ausweis vorzulegen. Demokraten und Interessengruppen, darunter MALDEF, demonstrierten während der Sitzung gegen die Wähler-ID-Maßnahme und behaupteten, sie würde die Wahlbeteiligung zu einer Zeit verringern, in der Texas bei der Teilnahme an den Wahlurnen bereits am Ende aller Bundesstaaten rangiert. Während der Debatte über den Wahlausweis machten die Demokraten geltend, das Gesetz würde es insbesondere Senioren erschweren, die seit Jahren keinen Lichtbildausweis haben, um zu wählen. „Wenn [Wähler] in letzter Minute versuchen, einen Führerschein zu bekommen und versuchen, die benötigten Dokumente zu bekommen, und sie abgelehnt werden, wird das den Prozess verlangsamen“, sagte Figueroa. Adjutanten sowohl von Pitts als auch von State Rep. Charlie Geren, R-Fort Worth, die mit dem Senat zusammenarbeiteten, um die Änderung an SB 1 anzuhängen, sagten, sie seien sich dieser Bedenken nicht bewusst. Sie stellten fest, dass eine Mehrheit der Senatsdemokraten während der regulären Sitzung für SB 9 gestimmt hatte, als es die Bestimmung über den Führerschein/Ausweis enthielt. Aber Geren äußerte diese Woche einen gewissen Unmut darüber, dass die Sprache des Führerscheins es auf den Gesetzentwurf zu Steuerangelegenheiten geschafft hat, während die Sprache der „Sanctuary Cities“ – die es lokalen Behörden verbieten würde, Richtlinien zu verabschieden, die die Durchsetzung der staatlichen und bundesstaatlichen Einwanderungsgesetze verhindern – dies nicht tat. Die Nichtverabschiedung eines Gesetzentwurfs für Heiligtumsstädte, den Gouverneur Rick Perry während der regulären Sitzung zu einem Notfall erklärt und dem Sondersitzungsaufruf hinzugefügt hatte, führte zu einer Runde von Schuldzuweisungen durch das Repräsentantenhaus und den Senat. Das Repräsentantenhaus, das in der regulären Sitzung einen Gesetzentwurf verabschiedete, beschuldigte den Senat, diesem nicht gefolgt zu sein. Der Senat, der in der Sondersitzung ein Gesetz verabschiedete, beschuldigte das Repräsentantenhaus, es in der Sondersitzung nicht einmal aus dem Ausschuss genommen zu haben. Perry beschuldigte dann den Senator des Staates, Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock, der den Vorsitz des SB 1-Konferenzkomitees führte, sich geweigert zu haben, dem Bericht des Komitees Schutzstädte hinzuzufügen. „Es waren mehrere Interviews, [in denen] einige der Senatoren sagten, dass SB9 nicht in SB1 gehöre“, sagte ein animierter Geren. „Nun, sie wollten verdammt noch mal diesen Teil von SB9 in SB1.“	Kreml: Die Diagnose der deutschen Klinik über Nawalnys Zustand zeigt nicht, dass er definitiv vergiftet wurde	partially false
88a75bcc	Ein 30-jähriger Mann aus Kentucky unterzog sich einer radikalen plastischen Operation, um Jesus Christus körperlich ähnlich zu werden. Laut der Lexington Daily Tribune folgt Mark Emery bereits seit einigen Jahren auf vielfältige Weise den Fußstapfen Jesu, wurde selbst Zimmermann und studierte alte jüdische Gesetze und religiöse Texte. Er ging so weit, mehr als 215.000 Dollar für zwei Jahre Schönheitsoperationen auszugeben, um seine körperliche Erscheinung so zu verändern, dass sie Jesus ähnelte. Nach insgesamt 21 chirurgischen Eingriffen ist er mit dem Ergebnis „fast zufrieden“. „Manche Leute kaufen schicke Autos oder schicke Villen … Ich benutze mein Geld, um meine Liebe zu Jesus zu zeigen, indem ich mich operieren lasse, damit ich ihm ähnlicher sehe“, sagt Mr. Emery. „Ich versuche, nach seinem Vorbild zu leben und ihm so ähnlich wie möglich zu sein. Für mich war es nicht genug, sich wie Jesus zu benehmen, ich wollte wirklich wie er sein und aussehen wie er.“ Der junge Mann verwendete verschiedene Bilder und Ikonen, um das tatsächliche Erscheinungsbild Christi zu bestimmen, bevor er mit seinen verschiedenen Operationen begann. In den sozialen Medien sind bereits viele Kritiker aufgetaucht, die Mr. Emerys Versuch, Jesus Christus zu ähneln, anprangern oder verspotten. Hunderte von Menschen, einschließlich verschiedener religiöser Führer, haben einige religiös orientierte Kritiker geäußert und seinen Wunsch, die Erscheinung Christi physisch nachzuahmen, als „Blasphemie“ oder „Häresie“ angeprangert. „Christen lieben Jesus und versuchen, sich wie er zu verhalten, nicht wie er auszusehen. Schäm dich. Das ist lächerlich und antichristlich“, schrieb Pastor John Hagee auf seinem Twitter-Account. Viele Kritiker haben die Operation von Herrn Emery auch als „lächerlich“ bezeichnet, da die physische Erscheinung von Jesus Christus unklar bleibt und immer noch Gegenstand vieler Debatten ist. Ein Special auf PBS Special hat eine große Studie zusammengestellt, um festzustellen, wie Jesus ausgesehen haben muss, und dies ist das Ergebnis, das sie erhalten haben. Die Bibel selbst gibt keine physische Beschreibung von Jesus im Sinne einer Beschreibung seines Hauttons, seiner Frisur oder seiner Gesichtszüge. Viele Theorien wurden im Laufe der Jahre von Gelehrten ausgearbeitet, einige davon unglaublich weit hergeholt, die behaupten, dass Jesus unter anderem Westafrikaner, Ägypter oder Halbrömer gewesen sein könnte, aber keine dieser Behauptungen wurde durch Beweise gestützt. Unter Historikern ist allgemein anerkannt, dass Jesus nicht europäischer Abstammung war, wie er normalerweise auf Ikonen und Kruzifixen dargestellt wird. Er hätte stattdessen einem modernen Araber, Türken oder anderen Mann aus dem Nahen Osten mit einer etwas dunkleren Hautfarbe geähnelt. Trotz all dieser Kritiker sagt Mr. Emery, dass er mit den Ergebnissen seiner Operation wirklich zufrieden ist und behauptet, dass er sich jetzt Jesus näher fühlt als je zuvor in seinem Leben.	Monate nachdem ihr die Medienzulassung für das Texas House verweigert wurde, hat die konservative Organisation Texas Scorecard – ein Produkt von Empower Texans, einer Tea Party-nahen politischen Interessenvertretung mit einem der am besten finanzierten politischen Aktionskomitees des Staates – eine First Amendment-Klage eingereicht, in der sie argumentiert dass ihre Ablehnung durch die Unterkammer eine „verfassungswidrige Sichtweise Diskriminierung“ darstellt. Bevor die Legislaturperiode im Januar begann, beantragten zwei Mitarbeiter von Texas Scorecard, Brandon Waltens und Destin Sensky, in beiden Kammern der Legislative einen Medienausweis. Im Senat wurden ihre Beglaubigungen erteilt; im Haus wurden sie verweigert. Die beiden Kammern befolgen ähnliche Regeln darüber, wer speziellen journalistischen Zugang zum Wort hat, und beide verbieten Lobbyisten. Aber die politische Atmosphäre der Kammern ist unterschiedlich. Der Vorsitzende der Hausverwaltung, Charlie Geren, ein Republikaner aus Fort Worth, der in der Vergangenheit mit Empower Texans und seinem PAC gekämpft hat, teilte der Gruppe in einem Ablehnungsschreiben im Januar mit, dass sie nicht für Medienausweise in Frage komme, weil „die Organisation, bei der Sie angestellt sind, Texas Scorecard, eng mit einem politischen Mehrzweckausschuss (GPAC) verbunden ist und dass auf der Website der Organisation vor der Legislative die Interessenvertretung für politische Angelegenheiten hervorgehoben wird.“ Als Beweis für die Zugehörigkeit der Gruppe zum PAC führte Geren die gemeinsame Adresse der Organisationen an – aber als Gerens Brief ausgestellt wurde, so die Klage, teilten sie diese Adresse nicht mehr mit. Empower Texans PAC hat die Hauptgegner von Geren unterstützt und Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, der den Senat von Texas leitet, in den letzten fünf Jahren mehr als 850.000 US-Dollar gegeben. In der Klage, die diese Woche beim Bundesgericht in Austin eingereicht wurde, behauptet die Organisation, dass ihre Geschichte mit Geren – der, wie es in der Beschwerde heißt, „aufgrund ihrer Veröffentlichungen“ „routinemäßig und offen Feindseligkeiten“ gegenüber der Gruppe zum Ausdruck gebracht hat – dazu geführt habe Beteiligen Sie sich an einer „diskriminierenden Sichtweise in böser Absicht“. Es fordert einen Bundesrichter auf, Geren zu zwingen, den beiden Mitarbeitern Medienausweise auszustellen. Am Mittwochmorgen auf dem Boden des Texas House angekommen, sagte Geren, er habe keinen Kommentar zu der Klage. Empower Texans, das unter mehreren Namen operiert, ist eine einzigartige Mischung aus politischem Aktionskomitee, Interessenvertretung und Nachrichtenagentur. Während der Sitzung produziert es eine zweiwöchentlich erscheinende Zeitung und einen Wochentags-Morgen-Newsletter sowie einen wöchentlichen Podcast und eine Videosendung. Aber die Organisation setzt sich auch direkt für spezifische Abstimmungen über bestimmte Maßnahmen ein – indem sie regelmäßig „Abstimmungsbenachrichtigungen“ veröffentlicht, die gewählte Beamte auffordern, ihre Prioritäten zu unterstützen – und stuft Gesetzgeber auf einer Skala von A bis F entweder als „Pro“ oder „Anti-Steuerzahler“ ein. Obwohl sie keine Medienausweise im Texas House haben, können Waltens und Sensky – wie alle anderen auch – in der öffentlichen Galerie im zweiten Stock sitzen. Nur Journalisten, Gesetzgeber, Mitarbeiter und besondere Gäste sind auf den Etagen der Kammern zugelassen, wo sie leichteren Zugang zu gewählten Beamten haben. In der Klage wird behauptet, dass „[Geren] die Rechte der Kläger auf freie Meinungsäußerung und Pressefreiheit verletzt, indem er den Klägern den Zugang zum Saal des Repräsentantenhauses verweigert, der dem entspricht, der anderen Medienvertretern gewährt wird“. In der Beschwerde heißt es, dass „kein Mitarbeiter von Empower Texans verpflichtet ist, sich als Lobbyist zu registrieren, und dass die Organisation keine Person anstellt oder einen Vertrag mit ihr abschließt, die sich als Lobbyist registrieren muss“. Die Organisation hat sich zuvor als journalistische Einrichtung präsentiert. Im Jahr 2017 zog Geren einen Presseausweis, der für einen anderen Mitarbeiter der Gruppe ausgestellt worden war, Cary Cheshire Waltens und Sensky sind übliche Fixpunkte am Pressetisch im Senat von Texas, wo ihre Berichterstattung manchmal die konservative Ausrichtung ihrer Organisation widerspiegelt. Sie haben auch über Vorgänge im Texas House berichtet.	false

8de5ccdd	248 Bezirke haben mehr registrierte Wähler als lebende Erwachsene 24 Bundesstaaten weisen beschädigte Wählerverzeichnisse auf (INDIANAPOLIS, IN.) – 25. September 2017: Die Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) gab heute bekannt, dass sie 248 Bezirke wegen mehr registrierter Wähler als gekündigt hat erwachsene Einwohner in ihren jeweiligen Gerichtsbarkeiten. Beamte in 24 Bundesstaaten riskieren jetzt Klagen, wenn sie keine zufriedenstellenden Daten offenlegen, die wirksame Bemühungen zur Pflege des Wählerverzeichnisses vor und nach der Wahl 2016 belegen. „Während der Wahl 2016 hatten 24 Bundesstaaten aufgeblähte Wählerlisten“, sagte PILF-Präsident und General Counsel J. Christian Adams. „Wahlbetrug beginnt mit korrumpierten Wählerverzeichnissen. Die Wählerverzeichnisse unserer Nation enthalten Aufzeichnungen, die nicht zwischen lebend und tot unterschieden werden können; Bürger oder Ausländer; wohnhaft oder umgezogen. Wir hören von möglichen Cyberangriffen, aber wir tun nicht genug, um Wählerverzeichnisse zu reparieren, die sicherlich korrupt sind. Die Wählerlisten sind in einigen Staaten so schlecht, dass es Wahlbeamten schwerfallen würde, den Unterschied zwischen Sabotage und Fahrlässigkeit zu erkennen.“ Briefe, die an die fraglichen Bezirke und Orte geschickt wurden, stellen fest, dass sie anscheinend gegen das National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) verstoßen, weil sie die Wählerverzeichnisse nicht ordnungsgemäß führen. Die NVRA (auch bekannt als Motor Voter) verlangt von staatlichen und lokalen Wahlbeamten, dass sie Wählerverzeichnisse ordnungsgemäß führen und sicherstellen, dass nur berechtigte Wähler registriert werden. Mehr Registrierte als lebende Erwachsene zu halten, weist darauf hin, dass die Wahlbeamten es versäumt haben, die Wählerverzeichnisse ordnungsgemäß zu führen. Die Public Interest Legal Foundation hat eine hervorragende Bilanz bei der Erhebung von Rechtsstreitigkeiten gegen Bezirke und Gemeinden mit aufgeblähten Wählerverzeichnissen – mit Einigungen und Zustimmungsdekreten, die, wenn sie richtig befolgt werden, die Gerichtsbarkeiten auf den Weg zu realistischeren Wählerregistrierungsquoten bringen werden. PILF war in den letzten zwei Jahren an der Erhebung von neun separaten Klagen zur Durchsetzung der Listenpflegebestimmungen der NVRA beteiligt, darunter in Texas, Mississippi, Florida, North Carolina, Virginia und Pennsylvania. PILF hat vor kurzem den ersten Prozess in der Geschichte der NVRA zur Durchsetzung der Listenpflegeverpflichtungen abgeschlossen. Der Fall wurde im Namen der American Civil Rights Union gegen Broward County, Florida, vorgebracht. Bundesstaaten mit Grafschaften, die ein Mitteilungsschreiben erhalten haben, sind (Anzahl der Grafschaften): Kentucky (41), Michigan (32), Iowa (31), Illinois (22), Mississippi (19), Colorado (17), Texas (12), Alabama (12), South Dakota (12), Nebraska (9), Georgia (6), New York (6), West Virginia (6), New Mexico (5), North Carolina (5), Kalifornien (2), Louisiana (2), Montana (2), Virginia (2), Arizona (1), Florida (1), Missouri (1), Oklahoma (1) und Washington State (1). Dass Kentucky Michigan als den am stärksten aufgeblähten Staat übertrifft, betrifft insbesondere die kriegerische, öffentliche Weigerung des Außenministers, Wählerdaten mit der Präsidialkommission für Wahlintegrität zu teilen, obwohl der Staat hier dieselben Informationen anbietet. „Das Bundesgesetz verlangt von den Wahlbeamten, dass sie angemessene Anstrengungen unternehmen, um die Wählerregistrierungslisten frei von toten Wählern, nicht wählbaren Wählern und weggezogenen Wählern zu halten“, heißt es in den Mitteilungsschreiben. „Basierend auf unserem Vergleich öffentlich zugänglicher Informationen, die vom U.S. Census Bureau und der Federal Election Assistance Commission veröffentlicht wurden, scheint es, dass Ihre Gerichtsbarkeit diese Anforderungen des Bundesgesetzes nicht erfüllt.“ In den Mitteilungen wird nach einer Vielzahl von Dokumenten gesucht, um klar zu erkennen, welche Gerichtsbarkeiten grundlegende Pflichten zur Führung der Wählerliste nicht erfüllen. Einige Aufzeichnungen erregten Anlass zur Sorge: Nicht-Bürgerwähler; Anzahl von Toten, Duplikaten, Umsiedlern und Verbrecherumzügen; Nachweis der Verwendung für Datenbanken, die umgesiedelte oder ausländische Registrierungspflichtige besser identifizieren; und unter anderem Mitteilungen Dritter über Wählerverzeichnisse. Wenn ein lokaler Beamter nicht auf den Brief von PILF antwortet oder sich weigert, Einsicht in die Wahlunterlagen zu gewähren, riskiert er eine Bundesklage.

Die Stiftung existiert, um Staaten und andere dabei zu unterstützen, die Sache der Wahlintegrität zu unterstützen und gegen die Gesetzlosigkeit bei amerikanischen Wahlen zu kämpfen. PILF stützt sich auf zahlreiche Experten auf diesem Gebiet und versucht, das Wahlrecht zu schützen und den verfassungsmäßigen Rahmen amerikanischer Wahlen zu wahren. ###	Der falsche Krieg gegen CO2	false
976a9cc4	The row over school closures during the pandemic has exploded into full blown conflict this weekend, with teachers putting Nicola Sturgeon in the firing line, and turning on a hardline parent group which wants kids back in class no matter what. Writer at Large Neil Mackay reports The teachers SCOTLAND’S teachers have had enough. Firstly, teachers say, they’ve had enough of Nicola Sturgeon putting her electoral fortunes ahead of education. Secondly, they’ve had enough of being bullied, harassed and attacked by what they see as a highly politicised mob on social media employing Trump-style tactics against them, and demanding schools stay open even in the most dangerous of circumstances. Larry Flanagan, head of Scotland’s largest teaching union the EIS, deals with the Scottish Government every day as the nation’s schools struggle to make it through lockdown. Ask him about Sturgeon’s handling of Covid and schools and he pointedly says: “I think the First Minister is very focused on the election.” Privately, senior Scottish teachers who work with the Government on the pandemic aren’t so diplomatic. “John Swinney [Deputy First Minister and Education Secretary] has his eye firmly fixed on the educational challenges,” one said. “The First Minister has her eye firmly fixed on the election. There’s a tension in Government there.” Flanagan feels that “Nicola Sturgeon and her Government are as focused on the politics of the situation as they are on the educational issues – whereas our focus is entirely educational”. The SNP administration “has an eye on the political optics as much as anything else”. Sturgeon is sensitive to criticism that she’s putting politics before education. Flanagan says he doesn’t understand why “as it’s in their DNA”. Flanagan also feels that “the general message of the Government has been less than empathetic to teachers”. The experience of teachers has been “harrowing, high stress … Most have been living on the edge and torn between the desire to do their best for students but also knowing they’re at risk on a daily basis … A lot feel undervalued, particularly by Government and the political class.” He adds: “It can be a demoralising experience. We’ve said directly to Government … that it’s shown a distant lack of empathy with the challenges that have existed in schools, as if there are no issues to be concerned about. They’ve underplayed teacher concerns.” On the First Minister, Flanagan says: “If you were to analyse most of her comments she rarely says very much about teachers, her focus is on parents and pupils, and that’s legitimate … for her to be concerned about, but I think a lot of teachers feel she’s just dismissive of their concerns.” Although schools are now closed, many teachers feel they had to battle to get this far against a government which wanted to put the wishes of parents before safety. Although teachers obviously worry for themselves and their families, many also felt that keeping schools open endangered pupils, pupils’ families and the wider community. Teachers haven’t forgotten the period before Christmas when they clamoured for school closures as the new Covid variant started to hit but the Government remained intransigent, insisting schools were safe and should remain open. Teachers were horrified that schools remained opened as level four restrictions were introduced. “That’s when the political debate became sharper,” Flanagan said, adding: “All we wanted was at level four, each council should look at the potential for blended or remote learning if it was required.” He references cases such as one Scottish school which “had over 400 pupils off with Covid-related illnesses and self-isolation ... and they still weren’t closing the school … We were saying there’s clearly a huge community outbreak in this area – closing the school makes sense, going to remote learning is a better educational position and it’ll drive down infection levels, but at that point it had become a kind of totem for the Government that they weren’t going to close schools”. Flanagan told Swinney that he thought the Education Secretary was “frightened to close schools in case you get a backlash”. Nor have teachers forgotten that the Government backtracked on plans for blended learning and suddenly switched, opting for a full reopening of schools last summer. “That was just a straight political decision as the FM was concerned at the backlash … the FM realised that having blended learning for a year was unlikely to do her party’s election chances any good so she wanted a different message.” Referencing the past debate around closing schools, Flanagan highlighted what he calls “the sophistry you get from the Scottish Government. They said ‘the risk to teenagers is no greater than to adults’. Well, that’s fine, but there’s quite a high risk to adults. You’re downplaying it by saying ‘it’s not greater than’ … John Swinney kept saying schools were safe environments. I kept saying they’re not … that’s why teachers were getting annoyed as they downplayed the risk.” Claims over the safety benefits of pupils social distancing incense teachers. “It’s not possible,” says Flanagan. No teacher spoken to said it was possible to keep a class of 30 pupils socially distanced. Teachers have also expressed concerns over Government use of data. Flanagan says that in November, data was used to claim schools were safe but statistics covered just the first six weeks of schools being reopened. “There was political sleight of hand to reference a retrospective report as being immediately applicable to the current situation,” he says. The EIS leader, who sits on the Government’s Covid Education Recovery Group, also raised concerns about the circumstances surrounding schools staying open at the end of last year. “At the time we were calling for a ‘firebreak’ while the Government and local authorities were saying ‘no’, but looking back at the data for the period it shows that school infections had reached their highest peak in all age groups since the pandemic started.” Flanagan added: “I think the Government and the First Minister have got a political objective around schools being open. They’d say that’s because, like us, they understand the importance of schools to young people’s wellbeing. We’re not going to disagree on that but I think they also have quite a political agenda. They’re potentially open to attack from other parties if they’re seen to be closing schools – and getting parental backlash.” In comparison to the UK Government, however, Flanagan is clear that “by and large the Scottish Government’s default position is to seek partnership and collaboration”. The EIS is fully involved in discussions about decision-making. In England, teacher groups “struggle just to get dialogue”. The Scottish Government, he stresses, “is not as unreasonable as the UK Government”. Flanagan is conscious of the fact that he has to keep Government onside. “I need to be able to persuade Government to do the right thing,” he says. Many members, however, are keen to strike if pushed too far. “Ultimately, we’re trying to get a reasonable response from Government … it would be failure of the partnership approach if we had to ballot for industrial action.” Sturgeon said this week that schools will remain shut until at least the middle of February. Teachers, though, fear a rush to reopen before its safe. Flanagan points to the new variant’s “transmissability among young people”. There are fears over reopening schools without properly enforced social distancing among pupils. “All that will happen is the R figure will go up,” Flanagan says. In terms of discussions around the future of reopening schools, he adds: “There’s a lot of unknowns and they’re all contingent on the control of the virus and the impact of the vaccine.” The vast majority of teachers want schools open but they want them reopened safely. “Teachers absolutely know that schools being open is the best thing possible for kids, it’s the easiest option for teachers when it comes to learning as remote learning is a huge challenge.” There is a worry among rank-and-file teachers that Government decisions are taken by civil servants and other experts who know little about life inside schools and so lack “empathy”. Flanagan says that when it comes to Covid, there have been “more fights with individual councils than we’ve had with Government”. There are sometimes different approaches taken to schools across different council areas. “Teachers who were shielding before we moved to lockdown, in a number of areas they were allowed to work from home,” Flanagan says. “In Glasgow, they said ‘no, you can’t, teachers are frontline, they have to be in school or off sick’. This was even for people with medical letters. Glasgow said ‘no’ – so Glasgow can be very hardline.” Teachers also worry that their safety comes secondary to the economy and allowing parents to work. “There’s an element around why schools need to open which isn’t about the needs of children, but the needs of the economy,” says Flanagan, though he adds: “I don’t think it’s writ as large in Scotland as it is in England … by and large Scotland has benefited from a more cautious approach to the virus.” Although teachers are sympathetic to parents, there is a limit to sympathy. “Some of the emails I’m getting … about having to support their child with home learning – I do have to temper my replies … They’re your children – the idea that the school should be there to provide childcare is an unwelcome thread.” Flanagan also feels that “the discourse around lost learning has to be challenged. What we have is interrupted learning, nothing is lost or irretrievable. There are kids every year who miss a whole year because they’re ill and you wouldn’t say about those kids ‘that’s it, you’ve missed your chance’. It’s nihilistic. To say your future is gone is just rubbish. Politicians fall into this trap far too easily.” Teachers are critical of Government failure to prepare for this new lockdown when it comes to remote learning and “digital inequality” – the lack of computers, and wi-fi, for poor children. The EIS says not enough equipment has been distributed. “In Glasgow, some iPads issued have protocols which don’t allow kids to access videos.” Flanagan urged the Government to follow a cautious approach to reopening schools. “The key issue now is, with potentially only a few months to go until the vaccine impacts, why would you run a high-risk strategy?” The parents Speak to most teachers, and they’ll tell you that they believe a new online group is twisting the national conversation around schools during Covid. Us For Them – which styles itself as a “grass-roots” parent lobby group – has too much influence in the thinking of the Scottish Government, teachers feel. UFT exists primarily on Facebook and sprang to life during lockdown. Flanagan calls them “the parents from nowhere” – although some figures such as Lord Jack McConnell, former Labour First Minister, has offered them support online. Certainly, UFT doesn’t take the constructive approach to parent-teacher relations of established groups like the National Parent Forum of Scotland. Teachers have accused UFT of undisclosed political connections. There have been claims of an anti-SNP agenda. Flanagan accused the organisation of having a “strong core of Covid deniers”. The EIS and UFT have been engaged in a war of words over claims that teachers were being recorded. Many teachers, Flanagan says, “feel they’re in state of siege”. He claims UFT is a “platform for self-promotion … some of them have political ambitions”. Flanagan says he doesn’t in any way “dismiss the concerns of parents around blended and remote learning” but UFT has “an anti-teacher agenda”. He worries that the organisation is “manipulating the concerns of parents”, and that “their language and attitude [is] intimidating”. Teachers are “concerned that Government pays too much attention” to the group, Flanagan says. He speculated that Sturgeon was not “immune” to the organisation “as she reacted to them very quickly last lockdown”. Jo Bisset is the face of UFT in Scotland. She won’t offer any solutions to help make schools safer. “Schools are safe,” Bisset claims, adding: “We don’t see ourselves as having to solve a problem as it’s not a problem we acknowledge.” “We don’t see there’s any need for social distancing in schools … it isn’t a dangerous environment,” she says. Bisset claims that “face masks in schools are really inappropriate”, and references children with autism, hearing impairment and “selective mutism”. She claims “there’s a huge amount of harm from this enforcement of masks” and “having a mask on children in schools doesn’t make any sense”. Nor does Bisset support teachers wearing masks. “If there are vulnerable teachers in schools and they feel they need to wear masks I think my first question would be ‘should that teacher really be in school if they’re so vulnerable’? … Perhaps, they should be furloughed.” Bisset insists that UFT isn’t anti-teacher. “We’re incredibly in favour of teachers,” she claims. Teachers, though, recount incidents of being abused on social media by people connected to UFT. Bisset says this could be people who’ve had “a bad day … and just spill their guts – people often don’t think that closely about what they’re writing on social media and quite frankly why should they?” On the group’s campaign against Government closure of schools, she says: “We’re not going to stop. There may or may not be an election coming up and we think that education is the issue of the election … if political parties aren’t listening to parents now, then they really need to, otherwise they’re going to lose votes.” Bisset says claims that “we’re funded by dark money and we’re all failed Tory candidates and we’ve some big political agenda is completely wrong”. She insists all funding is from the public through sites like GoFundMe. On political connections, she says: “Well, there’s this one guy, but he’s secret, he’s not actually an active politician now but he has been.” She later adds: “He was a Labour MP.” UFT praises MSPs like Alex Neil of the SNP, who has criticised blended learning as “absolutely unacceptable”, and Michelle Ballantyne, tje former Conservative now leading Nigel Farage’s Reform Party in Scotland. Ballantyne was accused a few days ago of “an anti-lockdown rant”. Bisset accused the EIS of “concerted smear attempts”. When asked if UFT could have handled debate better, she replied: “I don’t care. I’m not in politics … I’m not responsible for what nameless people write on the internet.” Teachers say that as UFT frontwoman she must take responsibility. Bisset claimed she’d “love” to work in a classroom unmasked, and doesn’t believe teachers need to socially distance from children. Asked whether this posed a wider infection risk, she claimed: “Coronavirus is principally transmitted adult to adult, so as long as adults are socially distancing then you’re massively reducing your risk – so you can socially distance adults … in schools far more easily than you can do in many other sectors. So for me, if I was a teacher in a school, my key goal would be to socially distance from adults.” Several teachers were asked to comment on this. All dismissed it as “dangerous” or “nonsense”. Bisset, who is from Edinburgh and works in the oil and gas sector, has two teenage children in a private school. When asked if it was unfair of her to comment on state education, she replied: “I don’t know why I’d have to have my children in state school in order to be able to point out a fact that children in the state sector will be getting worse … education typically.” She said “private schools will be delivering a much more comprehensive level of education”. The Government's response Responding to EIS comments, a government spokeswoman said: “Our top priority is the health and safety of pupils, staff and teachers. The current lockdown demonstrates that commitment to keeping people safe. While decisions to move to remote learning are hard, they have been taken in a timely manner in light of the developing public heath position. While we acknowledge the long-standing campaign by Mr Flanagan to have schools closed, we believe that shift came at the right time. “Overall, we believe that the support in place for pupils learning remotely has been well-received. This includes, by the end of December, almost 59,000 devices such as laptops and over 10,000 connectivity packages distributed to learners. In total, the programme, supported by a £25 million investment, is expected to deliver over 70,000 devices for disadvantaged children and young people. A new package of £45 million, announced last week, means councils can supply additional devices or family support to those who need it most. That is substantial and is making a significant difference to the learning that pupils are receiving.”	Die Mehrheit der Briten glaubt, dass die Polizei die Kontrolle über die Straßen verloren hat	partially false
65d9521c	Die Bundesregierung hat die Schulverwaltung aufgefordert, mit den Vorbereitungen für die vollständige Wiedereröffnung der Schulen zu beginnen. Sani Aliyu, nationaler Koordinator der Presidential Task Force (PTF) zu COVID-19, gab die Anweisung beim PTF-Briefing am Donnerstag. Aliyu, der sie anwies, eine Risikobewertung durchzuführen, sagte, die Wiedereröffnung werde in Phasen erfolgen. „Für Bildungseinrichtungen, die Kindertagesstätten, Grundschulen, weiterführende und tertiäre Einrichtungen umfassen. Bildungseinrichtungen sollten in dieser Phase mit dem Prozess beginnen, auf eine mögliche Wiedereröffnung hinzuarbeiten“, sagte er. „Wir empfehlen den Staaten jedoch dringend, eine Risikobewertung durchzuführen, um sicherzustellen, dass sich alle Schulen auf einem Konformitätsniveau befinden, und einen Überwachungsmechanismus zu schaffen, um dieses Bereitschaftsniveau zu bewerten, zu schaffen und zu überwachen. In der Zwischenzeit sollten Kitas geschlossen bleiben, bis diese Risikostufe bewertet ist. Wenn Schulen geöffnet werden, muss dies schrittweise erfolgen und vorzugsweise in Phasen durchgeführt werden, um sicherzustellen, dass dies kein Risiko für die Öffentlichkeit und insbesondere für gefährdete Gruppen darstellt, die sich am Ende durch Schüler anstecken könnten, die nach Hause zurückkehren.“ Die Bundesregierung hatte im März eine landesweite Schließung von Schulen angeordnet, um die Ausbreitung von COVID-19 einzudämmen. Aber im Juli genehmigte die Regierung die Wiedereröffnung von Schulen für Schüler, die derzeit an der West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) teilnehmen.

650bd80f	Wenn die Anschuldigungen wegen „Rassismus“ und „Fremdenfeindlichkeit“ scheitern, lautet das Rückfallargument der Demokraten gegen die von Präsident Trump vorgeschlagene Grenzmauer, dass sie einfach „nicht funktionieren wird“, warum also Milliarden für den Bau verschwenden? Erzählen Sie das den Bewohnern von El Paso, Texas. Bundesdaten zeigen, dass eine weitaus weniger imposante Mauer als die, die Trump sich vorstellt – ein zweistöckiger Wellblechzaun, der erstmals unter der Bush-Regierung errichtet wurde – bereits dramatisch sowohl illegale Grenzübertritte als auch Kriminalität in der sechstgrößten Stadt von Texas, die an die grenzt, eingeschränkt hat Mexikanischer Stadt Juarez mit hoher Kriminalität. Tatsächlich ist die Zahl der abschiebbaren illegalen Einwanderer, die von der US-Grenzpatrouille ausfindig gemacht wurden, in den fünf Jahren, in denen der umstrittene neue Zaun gebaut wurde, um mehr als 89 Prozent gesunken, laut den von mir überprüften Daten des Heimatschutzes. Als das Projekt 2006 anfing, gab es insgesamt 122.261 illegale Grenzübertritte, aber bis 2010, als der 131-Meilen-Zaun von einem Ende von El Paso bis in die Wüste von New Mexico fertiggestellt war, schrumpften die Grenzübertritte von Einwanderern auf nur 12.251. Sie erreichten 2012 einen Tiefststand von 9.678, bevor sie im vergangenen Jahr langsam wieder auf insgesamt 25.193 zurückgingen. Aber sie liegen immer noch deutlich unter dem Niveau der Vorzäune, und die Grenzpolizei schreibt der befestigten Barriere, die El Paso von Mexiko trennt, die Verringerung der illegalen Ströme zu. Und die Kriminalität ging mit dem reduzierten Menschenverkehr aus Juarez zurück, das aufgrund der Gewalt des Drogenkartells als einer der gefährlichsten Orte der Welt gilt, und half El Paso, eine der sichersten Großstädte Amerikas zu werden. Bundesdaten zeigen, dass die Grenzstadt vor 2010 in Gewaltkriminalität und Drogenschmuggel verstrickt war, was zum großen Teil auf illegale Aktivitäten von mexikanischer Seite zurückzuführen war. Als der Zaun jedoch hochging, änderten sich die Dinge fast über Nacht. Seitdem hat El Paso die Rangliste für Städte mit 500.000 Einwohnern oder mehr mit niedrigen Kriminalitätsraten auf der Grundlage der vom FBI gesammelten Statistiken durchweg angeführt. Die Wende erregte sogar die Aufmerksamkeit der ehemaligen Heimatschutzministerin Janet Napolitano und anderer Beamter der Obama-Regierung, die sie als eine der sichersten Städte des Landes anpriesen, während sie die verstärkte Grenzsicherheit dort anführten. Bundesdaten zeigen, wie bemerkenswert die Trendwende bei der Kriminalität seit dem Bau des Zauns war. Laut FBI-Tabellen sind Eigentumsdelikte in El Paso um mehr als 37 Prozent auf 12.357 von ihrem Höchststand vor dem Zaun von 19.702 pro Jahr gesunken, während Gewaltverbrechen um mehr als 6 Prozent auf 2.682 von einem Höchststand von 2.861 pro Jahr zurückgegangen sind. Die allgemeine Kriminalitätsrate in El Paso ist im vergangenen Jahr weiter gesunken, was die Stadtführer dazu veranlasste, die gute Nachricht in einer Pressemitteilung zu verbreiten, in der es hieß: „Weil El Paso eine Grenzstadt ist, könnte Sie die niedrige Kriminalitätsrate überraschen.“ Seit der Zaun fertiggestellt wurde, hat sich die Menge an Marihuana und Kokain, die durch El Paso gelangt und von Grenzschutzbeamten beschlagnahmt wurde, halbiert. Ein weiteres Kernversprechen von Trump zur Rechtfertigung des Baus einer massiven Mauer, die sich von Texas nach Kalifornien erstreckt, ist, dass sie den Fluss von Drogen, die aus Mexiko über die Grenze kommen, verlangsamen wird. „Wir brauchen die Mauer zur Sicherheit. Wir brauchen die Mauer aus Sicherheitsgründen“, sagte Trump letzte Woche, als er Fragen zum umfassenden neuen GOP-Einwanderungsgesetz beantwortete. „Wir brauchen die Mauer, um das Eindringen von Drogen zu stoppen.“ In dieser Hinsicht hat El Paso die Erwartungen bereits übertroffen. Auch der Drogenschmuggel entlang dieser Grenzübergangsstelle ist dramatisch zurückgegangen. Tatsächlich hat sich seit der Fertigstellung des Zauns die Menge an Marihuana und Kokain, die durch El Paso gelangt und von Grenzschutzbeamten beschlagnahmt wurde, halbiert. Im Jahr vor dem vollständigen Bau der Mauer im Jahr 2010 erreichte die Menge an illegalen Drogen, die von der FBI entlang der Grenze zu El Paso beschlagnahmt wurden, 87.725 Pfund. Im Jahr darauf sank die Menge der beschlagnahmten Drogen auf 43.783 Pfund. Letztes Jahr sanken sie sogar noch weiter auf insgesamt 34.329, laut Border Patrol-Berichten, die The Post vorliegen. Alles in allem unterstützt eine Legion empirischer Beweise die Idee, dass eine südliche Grenzmauer tatsächlich funktionieren könnte. Es gibt auch anekdotische Beweise. In lokalen Presseberichten haben Einwohner und Geschäftsinhaber von El Paso den Zaun gleichermaßen gelobt und ihn als wirksame Abschreckung sowohl gegen illegale Überfahrten als auch gegen Kriminalität bezeichnet. siehe auch Verhaftungen der Border Patrol fallen auf 46-Jahres-Tief Verhaftungen durch Border Patrol-Agenten fielen auf ein 46-Jahres-Tief ... Jetzt plant Trump, eine möglicherweise größere Abschreckung aufzubauen. Der bestehende Zaun entlang des El-Paso-Sektors, der aus einer Kombination aus Wellblech und Metallgeflecht besteht, ragt an einigen Stellen 21 Fuß hoch und ist bereits schwer zu erklimmen. Aber die Trump-Mauer, die in El Paso mit dem Bau beginnen wird, wird noch höher sein und mehrere Sicherheitsebenen haben. Dennoch sind demokratische Führer entschieden dagegen. Sie argumentieren, dass die 18-Milliarden-Dollar-Mauer nicht dazu beitragen wird, illegale Einwanderer und Drogen fernzuhalten, und nur eine massive Verschwendung von Steuergeldern sein wird. „Wir denken, offen gesagt, dass der Bau der Mauer weder durch ihre Effizienz noch durch ihre Effektivität gerechtfertigt ist“, sagte Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), Rep. Auch lokale Demokraten argumentieren mit Erfolg. „Diese Mauer an sich ist eine rassistische Reaktion auf einen rassistischen Mythos, der die Realität dieses Landes überhaupt nicht widerspiegelt“, sagte der Abgeordnete Beto O’Rourke (D-El Paso).

42b5592a	Proctor, VT – Laut NBC News wurde ein Pastor der Christian Proctor Church in Vermont zu einem Jahr Gefängnis verurteilt, nachdem er sich geweigert hatte, homosexuelle Paare zu heiraten. Dies kommt kurz nach der 5-4-Entscheidung des Obersten Gerichtshofs, dass Staaten die Homo-Ehe zulassen müssen. Der christliche Pastor, der 56-jährige Paul Horner, ließ seinen Anwalt in seinem Namen mit Reportern sprechen. „Wir bestreiten derzeit den Schuldspruch und ich bin zuversichtlich, dass mein Mandant hier in Kürze ein freier Mann sein wird“, sagte Anwalt Tom Downey. „Horner hat sich nur nach bestem Wissen und Gewissen für seine Rechte und Religionsfreiheit in diesem Land eingesetzt.“ Der ehrenwerte Myron Danus sprach das harte Urteil aus. „Religionsfreiheit gilt in beide Richtungen, Mr. Horner“, sagte Danus vor einem überfüllten Gerichtssaal. „Es steht Ihnen nicht zu, Einzelpersonen die gleichen Rechte zu verweigern, die alle anderen haben, Rechte, die vor einem Gericht, dem obersten Gericht, dem Obersten Gerichtshof, weitergegeben und vereinbart wurden. Es ist nicht Ihre Entscheidung, ob Sie mit dem Gesetz einverstanden sind oder nicht, sondern, was noch wichtiger ist, dass Sie es befolgen und durchsetzen.“ Laut der strafrechtlichen Untersuchung ist die Christian Proctor Church beim Staat als „religiöse Körperschaft“ registriert, die darauf beschränkt ist, „Ein-Mann-eine-Frau-Ehen, wie sie in der Heiligen Bibel definiert sind“, durchzuführen. Aber die Kirche ist auch als gewinnorientiertes Unternehmen registriert, und Stadtbeamte sagten, dass die Eigentümer die staatlichen und bundesstaatlichen Vorschriften einhalten müssen. Steve Shand, Präsident des Vermont Family Research Committee, sagte, es sei „offene Saison für Amerikaner, die sich weigern, sich der Neudefinition der Ehe durch die Regierung zu beugen“. „Homosexuelle sind schwul“, sagte Shand gegenüber Reportern. „Warum sollten christliche Prediger gezwungen werden, jede Ehe zu vollziehen und zu feiern, die ihrem Glauben widerspricht? Es ist ein rutschiger Abhang, mein Freund. Schon bald werden dieselben Pastoren gezwungen sein, Tiere oder Küchengeräte zu heiraten. Das ist nicht mein Amerika!“ Gwen Hawkins, die Präsidentin des LGBT Pride Centers in Vermont, sagte, sie sei mit dem Schuldspruch zufrieden. „Wir wollen einfach die gleichen Rechte wie alle anderen und dieser Schuldspruch stellt einen großen Präzedenzfall dar“, sagte Hawkins. „Diese fanatischen Christen gründen ihr Leben auf einen Vers in der Bibel, aber sie scheinen die anderen 99 % der Verse im Buch zu vergessen. Warum können wir zum Beispiel Bristol Palin nicht zu Tode steinigen, weil wir ein uneheliches Baby bekommen haben? Und was ist mit ihrer Mutter, Sarah Palin, die gegen die Regeln von Korinther 14:34 verstößt, die eindeutig besagen, dass es ihr als Frau nicht erlaubt ist, einen Mann zu lehren oder Autorität über ihn zu übernehmen; sie muss ruhig sein. Aber nein, sie wählen gerne den einen Vers in der Bibel über schwule Menschen aus und bauen ihr Lager darum herum.“ Proctor ist eine Stadt im Rutland County im US-Bundesstaat Vermont. Die Bevölkerung war 1.741 bei der Volkszählung 2010. In Proctor befinden sich das Vermont Marble Museum, Wilson Castle und die einzige Marmorbrücke Amerikas.	Warum sind Klimamodelle so fehlerhaft?

866a5b6b	Beaumont, Texas | Ein Angestellter des Leichenschauhauses von Jefferson County starb heute Morgen, nachdem er versehentlich von einem seiner Kollegen eingeäschert worden war. Nach Angaben der Beaumont Police Department beschloss der 48-jährige Henri Paul Johnson, nach sechzehn Stunden ununterbrochener Arbeit auf einer Trage ein Nickerchen zu machen. Während er schlief, verwechselte ihn ein anderer Mitarbeiter mit der Leiche eines 52-jährigen Autounfallopfers und trug ihn zum Krematorium. Bevor jemand den Fehler bemerken konnte, war er bereits Temperaturen zwischen 1400 und 1800 Grad Fahrenheit ausgesetzt und zu Asche reduziert worden. Jenna Davis, eine Mitarbeiterin von Henri Johnson, sagt, sie habe ihn etwa 15 Sekunden lang schreien hören, nachdem das Krematorium aktiviert worden war. „Zuerst haben wir nicht verstanden, woher das Geräusch kam. Als wir merkten, was passierte, war es zu spät. Wir haben die Heizung abgeschaltet, aber er war schon tot.“ Frau Davis behauptet, dass der junge Kollege, der den Unfall verursacht hat, ein neuer Angestellter war und vergessen hatte, nach der Zehenmarke zu suchen, um sicherzustellen, dass er den richtigen Körper hatte. Die Polizei hat eine Untersuchung eingeleitet, um die genauen Umstände des Todes von Herrn Johnson zu ermitteln. Die Ermittler haben die Möglichkeit einer Strafanzeige gegen den Mitarbeiter, der seinen Tod verursacht hat, nicht ausgeschlossen. Dem jungen Mann könnte möglicherweise fahrlässige Tötung vorgeworfen werden.	Capitol-Schießerei als Hollywood-Stunt entlarvt	false
83c0b379	Ein Nasa-Wissenschaftler sagte, dass eine aktuelle Verlangsamung der Sonnenfleckenaktivität dazu führen könnte, dass die Temperaturen in der oberen Schicht unserer Atmosphäre sinken. Andere Forscher haben zuvor davor gewarnt, dass das Fehlen von Sonnenflecken die Ankunft einer einzigartig düsteren „Mini-Eiszeit“ ankündigen könnte. Aber der Nasa-Wissenschaftler sagte weiter, dass der Trend, den er sehe, die allgemeine globale Erwärmung und nicht die Abkühlung sei, und bestand darauf, dass dieses „solare Minimum“ nicht bedeute, dass die Welt durch einen deprimierend langen Winter zittern werde. „Wir sehen einen Abkühlungstrend“, sagte Martin Mlynczak vom Langley Research Center der Nasa gegenüber Space Weather. „Hoch über der Erdoberfläche, nahe dem Rand des Weltraums, verliert unsere Atmosphäre Wärmeenergie. „Wenn sich die aktuellen Trends fortsetzen, könnte es bald einen Weltraumzeitalter-Rekord für Kälte aufstellen.“ „Es könnte innerhalb weniger Monate passieren“, fügte Mlynczak hinzu. Die Aktivität der Sonnenflecken folgt einem Zyklus, von dem angenommen wird, dass er 11 Jahre dauert, während die Anzahl der Flecken ihren Höhepunkt erreicht und abfällt. Die meiste Zeit dieses Jahres gab es nur sehr wenige Sonnenflecken. Ein Bild, das Anfang dieses Jahres aufgenommen wurde und die Oberfläche unseres Sterns ohne Sonnenflecken zeigt (Bild: Nasa) MEHR : Hacker werden 2019 das Internet lahmlegen Anfang dieses Jahres veröffentlichte die Nasa ein Bild, das das leere Gesicht der Sonne zeigt, das eher wie ein Snookerball als die brodelnde Oberfläche eines superheißen Sterns. Laut den Berechnungen der Nasa wird die Sonne voraussichtlich 2019 oder 2020 ihr solares Minimum erreichen. Die vielleicht berühmteste Periode geringer Sonnenfleckenaktivität war das Maunder-Minimum des 17. Jahrhunderts. Während dieser Zeit gab es eine „kleine Eiszeit“, als die Themse zufror, obwohl Forscher glauben, dass die globale Erwärmung dies verhindern wird. Das Sonnenminimum kann die Auswirkungen des Weltraumwetters verstärken, die Kommunikation und Navigation stören und sogar dazu führen, dass Weltraumschrott „herumhängt“, sagte die Nasa. MEHR : Ein Asteroid wird „unvermeidlich“ die Erde treffen und „katastrophale“ Auswirkungen auf die Menschheit haben, warnt Wissenschaftler Letztes Jahr behauptete ein Wissenschaftler, dass die abschreckende Wirkung auf das Fehlen von Sonnenflecken uns tatsächlich vor der globalen Erwärmung retten könnte – obwohl ihre Behauptungen heftig umstritten waren . Valentina Zharkova, Mathematikprofessorin an der Northumbria University, veröffentlichte ein Papier, das „die erste ernsthafte Vorhersage einer Verringerung der Sonnenaktivität enthält, die sich auf das Leben von Menschen auswirken könnte“. „Ich hoffe, dass die globale Erwärmung durch diesen Effekt aufgehoben wird und der Menschheit und der Erde 30 Jahre Zeit gibt, unsere Umweltverschmutzung zu beseitigen“, sagte sie. Michael Brown, außerordentlicher Professor für Astronomie an der Monash University in Australien, sagte, dass das Maunder-Minimum auch durch andere Faktoren verursacht worden sein könnte, darunter Vulkanausbrüche. Um dieses Video anzusehen, aktivieren Sie bitte JavaScript und erwägen Sie ein Upgrade auf einen Webbrowser, der HTML5-Videos unterstützt. Er glaubt nicht, dass eine Mini-Eiszeit ausreicht, um uns vor dem vom Menschen verursachten Klimawandel zu retten. „Es gibt jetzt 40 % mehr des Treibhausgases Kohlendioxid in der Luft als im 17. Jahrhundert, und globale Temperaturrekorde werden gebrochen“, sagte er. „Ein neues Maunder-Minimum würde den Klimawandel verlangsamen, aber es reicht nicht aus, um ihn zu stoppen.“ Nach der Veröffentlichung dieses Artikels gab Martin Mlynczak gegenüber Climate Feedback folgende Erklärung ab: „Die Abkühlungseffekte, die wir in der Thermosphäre der Erde sehen, sind eine Folge davon die aktuellen solaren Mindestbedingungen. „Die Thermosphäre ist die Schicht der Erdatmosphäre, die 65 Meilen über der Erdoberfläche beginnt und sehr empfindlich auf Sonnenaktivität reagiert. „Es besteht kein Zusammenhang zwischen dem natürlichen Kreislauf von Abkühlung und Erwärmung in der Thermosphäre und dem Wetter/Klima an der Erdoberfläche. Die NASA und andere Klimaforscher sehen weiterhin einen Erwärmungstrend in der Troposphäre, der Atmosphärenschicht, die der Erdoberfläche am nächsten liegt. „Es gibt keinen Widerspruch zwischen den wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen einer sich erwärmenden Troposphäre [wo wir leben] und dem Thermosphären-Klimaindex.“ Update: Dieser Artikel wurde seit der Erstveröffentlichung geändert, um die irrtümliche Andeutung einer möglicherweise rekordverdächtigen Abkühlung der Thermosphäre zu entfernen , das sich über 100 km über der Erdoberfläche befindet, würde auf die Troposphäre die Wirkung einer „Mini-Eiszeit“ haben. Wir stellen gerne klar, dass die als Teil eines natürlichen Zyklus der Sonnenaktivität gemeldeten Rekordtiefsttemperaturen nicht im Widerspruch zu aktuellen wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen einer sich erwärmenden Troposphäre stehen, und entschuldigen uns für jeden gegenteiligen Eindruck.

9e8e9ddd	ROM (Reuters) – Heutzutage ist es schwer, in Italien Katholik zu sein. Der Markusplatz ist praktisch menschenleer, nachdem ein Dekret angeordnet hat, dass ganz Italien in einem beispiellosen Vorgehen zur Bekämpfung des Coronavirus in Venedig, Italien, am 10. März 2020 gesperrt wird. REUTERS/Manuel Silvestri Sie können in eine Kirche gehen aber du kannst dich nicht mit Weihwasser bekreuzigen, weil das Taufbecken trocken ist. Sie können sich nicht in einer Kirche taufen oder heiraten lassen und Sie können nicht einmal eine Beerdigung haben. Fast das Einzige, was man in einer Kirche in Italien tun kann, ist beten – aber zumindest eine Bank von jemand anderem entfernt. Das überwiegend katholische Italien passt sich in Zeiten des Coronavirus an die Religion an, nachdem im ganzen Land ein hartes Durchgreifen verhängt wurde, um den schlimmsten Ausbruch Europas zu verlangsamen. Am vergangenen Samstag erließ die italienische Regierung ein Dekret, das einen Großteil des Nordens, wo das Virus zuerst ausbrach, sperrte und die Indoor-Aktivitäten im Rest des Landes stark einschränkte. So nahm am Sonntag Pater Riccardo Lamba von der Pfarrei San Ponziano in einem modernen Viertel Roms die Sache selbst in die Hand. Er verlegte die Messe ins Freie und sagte sie von den Stufen seiner modernen Kirche aus. Ungefähr 70 Gemeindemitglieder saßen auf Plastikstühlen mit Abstand zwischen ihnen und diejenigen, die standen, taten dies in Formation, als ob sie gleich einen Sportunterricht nehmen würden. Diashow ( 2 Bilder ) Später ergriff die Regierung Maßnahmen, um Versammlungen im Freien einzuschränken. Lamba sagte, er habe noch nicht entschieden, was er diesen Sonntag tun werde. „Wir beten. Viele Menschen betreten tagsüber die Kirche, um zu beten, versuchen aber, Abstand zu halten“, sagte er am Dienstag. Seine Gemeinde ist nicht allein. Sogar der Petersdom war am Dienstag unheimlich fast leer, nachdem der Vatikan erklärt hatte, dass nur Gläubige hineingelassen würden, die beten wollten. Touristen und geführte Gruppen würden bis mindestens 3. April nicht zugelassen. „Wir leben Tag für Tag, um was zu sehen das passiert. Manchmal ändert die Regierung ihre Meinung innerhalb weniger Stunden“, sagte Lamba. „Gott sei Dank können die hartgesottenen Gläubigen eine Messe im Fernsehen sehen.“ Kirchliche Trauungen wurden bis mindestens 3. April gesperrt. Der Trickle-Down-Effekt hat die Hochzeitsplanerbranche an der Schwelle zum Frühling, seiner Hochsaison, getroffen. „Wir haben das Büro vorerst geschlossen und müssen abwarten, wie sich die Dinge entwickeln“, sagte Sabrina Bucci, Chefin von Esclusivevent, die Hochzeiten in Roms Kirchen und Empfänge in einer antiken Villa mit Blick auf die Kuppel des Petersdoms organisiert . Sie sagte, fünf Hochzeiten seien auf unbestimmte Zeit verschoben worden. Die Coronavirus-Krise hat auch die Art und Weise verändert, wie Katholiken von ihren lieben Verstorbenen Abschied nehmen. Seit Beerdigungen in Kirchen verboten sind, werden Leichen entweder aus Krankenhäusern oder von zu Hause direkt auf Friedhöfe gebracht, was den Familien einen traditionellen Übergangsritus verweigert, der Menschen zusammenbringt. „Die Beerdigung heute Morgen konnte nicht abgehalten werden. Ein Priester kam ins Haus, um den Leichnam zu segnen, und wir brachten ihn direkt zum Friedhof“, sagte Stefano Chiericoni, Leiter eines der bekanntesten Bestattungsunternehmen Roms. „Wir tun, was uns die Gesundheitsbehörden vorschreiben, und tragen auf jeden Fall Masken und Schutzkittel“, sagte er.

bc815fa3	Präsident Wladimir Putin hielt am Donnerstag seine jährliche Pressekonferenz zum Jahresende ab und beantwortete Fragen von staatlichen Medien und unabhängigen Journalisten zu einer Reihe von Themen im Zusammenhang mit Russlands Innen- und Außenpolitik. Hier sind die Höhepunkte des Pressemarathons, der vier Stunden und 19 Minuten dauerte: Zur verfassungsmäßigen Beschränkung der Amtszeit der Präsidentschaft: — Eine Sache, die an diesen [Präsidentschafts-]Amtszeiten geändert werden könnte, ist die Streichung der Klausel über „aufeinanderfolgende“ [Amtszeiten]. Ihr bescheidener Diener diente zwei Amtszeiten hintereinander und verließ dann seinen Posten, jedoch mit dem verfassungsmäßigen Recht, wieder in den Posten des Präsidenten zurückzukehren, da diese beiden Amtszeiten nicht aufeinander folgten. [Diese Klausel] beunruhigt einige unserer politischen Analysten und Persönlichkeiten des öffentlichen Lebens. Nun, vielleicht könnte es entfernt werden. Zum Klimawandel: — „Aber wir sind uns nicht wirklich sicher, warum die globale Erwärmung stattfindet, aber wir müssen etwas dagegen tun.“ — „Wir haben das grünste Energiesystem der Welt. Neue Industrien sind entstanden: verflüssigtes Erdgas, Wasserkraft. Wer glaubt, dass wir von alten Ressourcen leben, irrt gewaltig.“ Zur Amtsenthebung von US-Präsident Donald Trump: – Sie formulieren Ihre Frage so, als ob Trumps Präsidentschaft zu Ende geht. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob das der Fall ist. [Das Amtsenthebungsgesetz] muss noch durch den Senat gehen, wo meines Wissens die Republikaner die Mehrheit haben. Es ist unwahrscheinlich, dass sie einen Vertreter ihrer Partei aus meiner Meinung nach völlig fabrizierten Gründen von der Macht entfernen wollen. Zu Russlands Streit mit Deutschland über die Ermordung eines ehemaligen tschetschenischen Rebellen in Berlin: „Die Frage der Auslieferung von Khangoshvili wurde auf der Ebene unserer Sonderdienste diskutiert, aber es gab kein offizielles Ersuchen, weil wir wussten, dass es abgelehnt werden würde.“ — „Das ist ein absoluter Killer. Er hat im Kaukasus 98 Menschen getötet – denken Sie darüber nach. Er war an den Anschlägen in der Moskauer U-Bahn beteiligt.“ Zur Wahl des britischen Premierministers Boris Johnson: — Johnson kann man gratulieren. Er war immerhin siegreich und hatte ein besseres Gespür für die Stimmung der britischen Öffentlichkeit als seine politischen Gegner. Und soweit ich weiß, beabsichtigt er, alle seine Brexit-Pläne umzusetzen. – In Bezug auf [russische] Einmischung oder Nichteinmischung haben wir viele Male von offiziellen Leitungsgremien in verschiedenen Ländern, einschließlich Großbritannien, Bewertungen darüber gehört, was in Russland passiert. Ist das eine Störung? Zu China: — Wir haben kein Militärbündnis mit China und wir planen auch nicht, eines zu gründen. — Aber unsere Beziehungen zu China entwickeln sich weiter, auch im Bereich der Verteidigungstechnologien ... Ich denke, China ist in der Lage, ein eigenes Frühwarnsystem für ballistische Raketen herzustellen, aber mit unserer Hilfe kann es dies früher tun. Dies wird die Verteidigungsfähigkeit unseres strategischen Partners erheblich verbessern. Zum Libyen-Konflikt: – Russland steht in Kontakt mit [dem libyschen Ministerpräsidenten Fayez] al-Serraj und mit [dem ostlibyschen Kommandanten Khalifa] Haftar. Wir pflegen auch ständig den Dialog mit unseren Partnern, einschließlich der Türkei, Europa und anderen Ländern. — Unserer Meinung nach wäre das beste Ergebnis eine Vereinbarung zwischen den beiden Konfliktparteien, die zu einem Ende der Militäraktionen führt und festlegt, wer das Land wie und mit welchen Verantwortlichkeiten regieren wird. Zur Verlängerung des neuen START-Rüstungskontrollvertrags mit den USA: — Wir sind bereit, bis Ende des Jahres das bestehende Abkommen, den neuen START-Vertrag, zu verlängern. — Aber bisher gab es auf keinen unserer Vorschläge eine Antwort. Und ohne einen neuen START-Vertrag steht einem Wettrüsten nichts mehr im Weg. Und das ist meiner Meinung nach schlecht. Zum Dopingskandal Russlands: — Wenn die WADA keine Ansprüche gegen unser nationales Olympisches Komitee hat, dann sollte unser Team unter seiner eigenen Flagge teilnehmen dürfen. Zu den Friedensgesprächen in der Ukraine: — Wenn eine Revision der Minsker [Friedens-] Vereinbarungen beginnt, dann könnte die Situation in eine völlige Sackgasse geraten. — Ein direkter Dialog über Donbass ist erforderlich. Es fehlt. Zur Internetfreiheit und dem Gesetz über „ausländische Agenten“: — „Freies Internet und souveränes Internet widersprechen sich nicht. Das [‘souveräne Internet‘]-Gesetz zielt nur darauf ab, negativen Einfluss im Falle einer Beschränkung ausländischer Ressourcen zu verhindern.“ – „Wir bewegen uns nicht in Richtung einer Abschottung des Internets und werden dies auch nicht tun.“ — „Nicht wir haben den Begriff ‚ausländischer Agent‘ geprägt. Ein ähnliches Gesetz ist in den USA seit den 1930er Jahren in Kraft.“	Die GOP-Kandidaten von Florida für den Gouverneur befassen sich mit den Amtszeitbeschränkungen der Schulbehörde	partially false
72eb0d0c	"Als Reaktion auf die Anprangerung des Rechts von General David Petraeus, das Recht des Pastors Terry Jones aus Florida, sich an einem symbolischen Protest gegen die Anschläge vom 11. September zu beteiligen, indem er am 11. September Kopien des Korans verbrannte, sagte Präsident Obama: „Lassen Sie es mich klar sagen: Als ein Bürger, und als Präsident glaube ich, dass die Mitglieder des Dove World Outreach Center das gleiche Recht auf Rede- und Religionsfreiheit haben wie jeder andere in diesem Land."" Gouverneur Charlie Crist aus Florida lobte Obamas Äußerungen und sagte, Amerika sei „ein Ort, an dem Sie in der Lage sein sollten, Ihre Religion auszuüben, ohne dass die Regierung Ihnen sagt, dass Sie dies nicht können“. Der Bürgermeister von New York City, Michael Bloomberg, nannte Obamas Worte eine „klare Verteidigung der Religionsfreiheit“ – und behauptete auch, dass er kürzlich einem dreckigen Dschihadisten begegnet sei, der tatsächlich die Koranverbrennung unterstützt habe! Keith Olbermann las das Gedicht ""First they came ..."" zur Verteidigung der Koranverbrenner auf Sendung und brachte sich fast zu Tränen wegen seiner eigenen Tiefgründigkeit. Nein, warte, mein Fehler. Das sagten die Liberalen vor nur fünf Minuten über die Ground-Zero-Moschee, als sie sich als Absolutisten des Ersten Verfassungszusatzes ausgaben. Plötzlich haben sie eine Amnesie entwickelt, wenn es um das Recht auf freie Meinungsäußerung geht, einen Koran zu verbrennen. Seltsamerweise sind Konservative, die gegen den Bau der Moschee am Ground Zero waren, auch gegen die Koranverbrennung. (Außer in meinem Fall. Es stellt sich heraus, dass ich dafür bin, aber hauptsächlich, weil das Verbrennen von Koranen zur globalen Erwärmung beitragen wird.) Liberale könnten sich nicht weniger um den Ersten Verfassungszusatz kümmern. Im Gegenteil, die Zensur von Sprache und Religion ist die Spezialität der Linken! (Jede andere Religion als der Islam.) Sie fördern Redekodizes, Hassverbrechen, Zonen der freien Meinungsäußerung (bekannt als „Amerika“ abseits der College-Campusse) und ziehen durch das Land, um jeden Hinweis auf Gott durch endlose Klagen der ACLU von der Öffentlichkeit zu reißen . Wann immer Sie einen Liberalen sehen, der unsere wertvollen verfassungsmäßigen Rechte verschluckt, können Sie sicher sein, dass wir über die Rechte von Muslimen am Nullpunkt sprechen, „Gott hasst Schwuchteln“-Begräbnis-Demonstranten, Stripperinnen, die New York Times, die geheime Dokumente veröffentlicht, Pornografen, Kinderschänder, Mörder, Verräter, Saboteure, Terroristen, Fahnenverbrenner (aber keine Koranverbrenner!) oder Frauen, die von Stipendien der National Endowment of the Arts leben, indem sie sich auf der Bühne Süßkartoffeln in die Körperöffnungen stopfen. Apropos verlogene Zwerge: Letzte Woche behauptete Bloomberg in „The Daily Show“, er habe mit seiner „Freundin“ einen Hamburger gegessen, als ein Mann auf ihn zukam und über die Ground-Zero-Moschee sagte: „Ich bin gerade von zwei Kämpfen im Ausland zurückgekommen für Amerika. Dafür haben wir alle gekämpft. Gehen Sie und bleiben Sie dran. Wir kämpfen für das Recht der Muslime, Moscheen am Nullpunkt zu bauen? Ich dachte, wir wollten Muslime von unseren Wolkenkratzern fernhalten. (Was für ein peinliches Missverständnis.) BITTE SOFORT DIE TRUPPEN HERAUSZIEHEN. Aber zurück zum Hauptproblem: Hatte Bloomberg einen 150-Dollar-Burger Double Truffle im DB Bistro Moderne oder einen vernünftigeren 30-Dollar-Burger im 21 Club, als er auf seinen imaginären Veteranen stieß? Da der kleine Bürgermeister beim Anblick eines Salzstreuers kreischte, nehme ich an, dass er kein Hardee's No. 4 Combo Meal hatte. Bloomberg fügte seiner kleinen Vignette ein realistisches Element hinzu und sagte: „Ich habe einen Hamburger und eine Gurke und einen Kartoffelchip oder so etwas.“ Ein Kartoffelchip? Übersetzung: ""Ich weiß nicht, was ich gegessen habe, weil ich mir diese ganze Geschichte ausgedacht habe - ich würde nicht tot erwischt werden, wenn ich 'einen Kartoffelchip' oder eine andere von den Bauern bevorzugte Schelmengarnitur essen würde."" Zumindest behauptete Bloomberg nicht, dass der Mann, der auf ihn zuging, das Verdienst hatte, die Bombe am Times Square gelegt zu haben, weil er ein Teegeselle war, der sich über ObamaCare aufregte – wie Sherlock Bloomberg damals so vorausschauend spekuliert hatte. General Petraeus lehnte den Protest gegen die Koranverbrennung mit der Begründung ab, dass er von radikalen Dschihadisten dazu benutzt werden könnte, Muslime für Angriffe auf Amerikaner zu rekrutieren. Das sagen Liberale immer dann, wenn wir etwas tun, was dem Feind missfällt – in den Irak einmarschieren, gefangene Terroristen in Guantanamo festhalten, gefangene Dschihadisten verhören oder Mohammed-Karikaturen veröffentlichen. Gibt es irgendwo eine Website, die alles auflistet, was zur Anwerbung von Terroristen ermutigt? Wenn das Hauptziel des Generals darin besteht, die Rekrutierung von Dschihadisten zu behindern, darf ich dann respektvoll eine bedingungslose Kapitulation vorschlagen? Denn nach seiner Theorie wissen Sie, was die Rekrutierungsfähigkeit der Terroristen wirklich zerstören würde? Wenn wir das Scharia-Gesetz annehmen würden! Aber Moment mal – hat uns Andrew Sullivan, Leiter der nationalen Sicherheit von Fire Island, nicht versichert, dass Amerika einen „braunhäutigen Mann wählen würde, dessen Vater Afrikaner war, der in Indonesien und Hawaii aufgewachsen ist und mehrheitlich Muslime besucht Schule als Junge"", würden die Terroristen wie ein Haufen Schwachköpfe aussehen und nicht in der Lage sein, zu rekrutieren? So hat es nicht geklappt. In Obamas ersten 18 Monaten im Amt gab es von diesen angeblich beruhigten Muslimen mehr Terroranschläge auf US-Boden als in den sechs Jahren unter Bush, nachdem er in den Irak einmarschiert war. Außerdem gab es, soweit ich mich erinnere, am 10. September 2001 kein Guantanamo, keinen Afghanistan-Krieg und keinen Irak-Krieg. Und doch hatte Osama bin Laden damals irgendwie keine Probleme mit der Rekrutierung. Können wir das Argument „es wird ihnen bei der Rekrutierung helfen“ schon zurückziehen? Der Grund, Korane nicht zu verbrennen, ist, dass es unfreundlich ist – nicht gegenüber Dschihadisten, sondern gegenüber Muslimen, die uns nichts Böses wollen. Dasselbe gilt für den Bau einer Moschee am Ground Zero - in beiden Fällen geht es nicht um die ""Rechte"" von irgendjemandem, es ist nur eine unangenehme Sache."

0de76e26	5 Millionen muslimische Kinder im Jemen starben im Jahr 2020 an Hunger, Kriegen, COVID-19 und Armut Sie haben in den letzten zwei Jahren von 2018 bis 2020 viele Artikel gelesen, in denen die meisten Artikel sagen, dass die Stiftung die Kinder retten soll 85.000 Kinder im Jemen starben im Jahr 2018 an Hunger, während einer dieser von Telegraph UK veröffentlichten Artikel besagt, dass 5 Millionen Kinder im Jemen im Jahr 2018 an Hunger sterben werden. Jetzt sind wir im Jahr 2020, und die Situation von Kriegen, Bürgerkriegen wurde nicht gelöst und die Situation hat sich seitdem weiter verschlechtert, wenn wir diesen von Telegraph UK veröffentlichten Bericht nehmen, denke ich, dass bisher mehr als 5 Millionen an Hunger gestorben sind im Jemen im Jahr 2020, während die Kriege andauern, ist COVID-19 da, kein Handel und kein Geld, nicht einmal ein einziges Paracetamol ist als medizinische Hilfe für diese hilflosen Muslime und ihre hilflosen und unschuldigen Kinder verfügbar.

Seitdem sind nun fast 2 Jahre vergangen, und Sie kennen die Situation im Jemen sehr gut. Als ein Gesundheitsbeamter ein Krankenhaus im Jemen besuchte, sagte er: „In einem Krankenhaus, das ich im Nordjemen besuchte, waren die Babys zu schwach zum Schreien, ihre Körper vom Hunger erschöpft“, sagte Thorning-Schmidt. Ein von Telegraph UK im Jahr 2018 veröffentlichter Bericht besagt: Laut der in Großbritannien ansässigen NGO sind derzeit insgesamt 5,2 Millionen Kinder im Jemen vom Hungertod bedroht. Im Jahr 2018 schrieben mehr als 10 weltbekannte Nachrichtenverlage über diese Krisen im Jemen mit einem Titel: Jemen: Bis zu 85.000 kleine Kinder starben an Hunger (The Guardian) Mehr als fünf Millionen Kinder im Jemen riskieren den Hungertod als Nahrung und Treibstoffpreise steigen (The Telegraph) Sogar Unicef ​​USA veröffentlichte ebenfalls: Krise im Jemen Jemens Kinder sind am Rande des Hungertods Aber die muslimische Ummah tut es? füllen die Taschen des arabischen Prinzen und Königs und loben sie, ohne sich der Krise bewusst zu sein.

168e5898	Erhöhtes atmosphärisches Kohlendioxid hat dazu beigetragen, die globale Nahrungsmittelproduktion zu steigern und die Armut zu verringern. Nationale Umfragen zeigen, dass der Klimawandel ganz unten auf der Prioritätenliste der Wähler steht. Aus gutem Grund: In den USA und in weiten Teilen der Welt wurden die gefährlichsten Umweltschadstoffe beseitigt. Die US-Emissionen von Partikeln, Metallen und verschiedenen Gasen – alle diese: Ozon, Blei, Kohlenmonoxid, Stickoxide und Schwefel – sind zwischen 1970 und 2014 um fast 70 % gesunken. Weitere Reduzierungen werden durch verbesserte Technologien wie die katalytische Entfernung von Oxiden erzielt Stickstoff- und effizientere Schwefelwäscher. Dies ist ein Segen für die menschliche Gesundheit. Aber es hält sich ein Mythos, der sowohl unwissenschaftlich als auch unmoralisch aufrechtzuerhalten ist: dass das nützliche Gas Kohlendioxid zu den gefährlichen Schadstoffen zählt. Es tut nicht. Im Gegensatz zu echten Schadstoffen ist Kohlendioxid (CO2) ein geruchloses, farbloses Gas. Jeder Mensch atmet täglich etwa zwei Pfund CO2 aus, zusammen mit einer ähnlichen Menge Wasserdampf. CO2 ist für Menschen und Tiere ungiftig und ein lebenswichtiger Nährstoff für Pflanzen. Es ist auch ein Treibhausgas, das dazu beiträgt, die Erde auf einer bewohnbaren Temperatur zu halten. Die Angst vor einer übermäßigen Erwärmung durch mehr CO2 in der Atmosphäre, einschließlich des durch menschliche Aktivitäten freigesetzten, hat einige Menschen veranlasst, sich für eine erhebliche und teure Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen einzusetzen. Aber Beobachtungen, wie die auf unserer Website der CO2 Coalition, zeigen, dass ein erhöhter CO2-Gehalt im nächsten Jahrhundert eine bescheidene und nützliche Erwärmung verursachen wird – vielleicht bis zu einem Grad Celsius (1,8 Grad Fahrenheit) – und dass dies ein noch größerer Vorteil sein wird zur Landwirtschaft als jetzt. Die Kosten für Emissionsregulierungen, die von allen getragen werden, werden strafend hoch sein und den meisten Menschen auf der ganzen Welt keinen Nutzen bringen.

2c6d2cf7	"Trump-Beamter überarbeitet Gedicht der Freiheitsstatue, um die Änderung der Regeln für Migranten zu verteidigen Veröffentlicht am 14. August 2019 Der Leiter der Staatsbürgerschafts- und Einwanderungsbehörde zwickte die Passage: ""Gib mir deine müden, deine Armen, deine zusammengekauerten Massen, die sich danach sehnen, frei zu atmen"". Der Beamte fügte die Worte hinzu, ""wer auf eigenen Beinen stehen kann und wer nicht zur öffentlichen Anklage wird"". Später sagte er, das Gedicht habe sich auf „Menschen aus Europa“ bezogen. Ken Cuccinelli, der amtierende Leiter der Staatsbürgerschafts- und Einwanderungsbehörde der Trump-Regierung, kündigte am Montag eine neue „öffentliche Anklage“-Anforderung an, die legale Migranten daran hindert, bestimmte öffentliche Leistungen wie Sozialwohnungen oder Nahrungsmittelhilfe in Anspruch zu nehmen, oder es wird davon ausgegangen, dass dies in den USA der Fall sein wird Zukunft. Bildrechte Getty Images Bildunterschrift „The New Colossus“ wurde 1883 von der in New York geborenen Dichterin Emma Lazarus geschrieben. Die als „Public Charge Rule“ bekannte neue Regelung wurde am Montag im Federal Register veröffentlicht und tritt am 15. Oktober in Kraft. Die Regeländerung soll die „Ideale der Selbstversorgung“ stärken, sagten Beamte. Kritiker argumentieren, dass es US-Bürger mit niedrigem Einkommen daran hindern wird, Hilfe zu suchen. Was hat der Beamte gesagt? Am Dienstag wurde Herr Cuccinelli von NPR gefragt, ob das Gedicht von 1883 mit dem Titel Der neue Koloss an der Freiheitsstatue noch immer gelte. „Würden Sie auch zustimmen, dass die Worte von Emma Lazarus, die in die Freiheitsstatue eingraviert sind, ‚Gib mir deine Müden, gib mir deine Armen‘, auch ein Teil des amerikanischen Ethos sind?“ fragte Rachel Martin von NPR. Bild-Copyright Getty Images Bildunterschrift Ken Cuccinelli, stellvertretender Leiter der US-amerikanischen Staatsbürgerschafts- und Einwanderungsbehörde „Das sind sie auf jeden Fall“, antwortete Herr Cuccinelli. ""Gib mir deine Müden und deine Armen - die auf eigenen Beinen stehen können und nicht zur öffentlichen Anklage werden."" „Diese Plakette wurde fast zur gleichen Zeit an der Freiheitsstatue angebracht, als die erste öffentliche Anklage [Gesetz] verabschiedet wurde – ein sehr interessanter Zeitpunkt“, fügte er hinzu. Die eigentliche Passage lautet auszugsweise: „Gib mir deine müden, deine armen, deine zusammengekauerten Massen, die sich danach sehnen, frei zu atmen, den elenden Abfall deiner wimmelnden Küste. Sende diese, die Obdachlosen, Sturmtoten zu mir, ich hebe meine Lampe neben die Goldene Tür!"" Im Interview fügte er hinzu, dass Immigranten willkommen seien, ""die auf eigenen Beinen stehen können, autark sind, sich wieder wie in der amerikanischen Tradition an den Stiefeln hochziehen"". Nachdem der Moderator gefragt hatte, ob die Politik „die Definition des amerikanischen Traums zu ändern scheint“, sagte er: „Wir laden die Menschen ein, hierher zu kommen und sich uns als Privileg anzuschließen.“ Niemand hat das Recht, Amerikaner zu werden, der es nicht ist Hier als Amerikaner geboren."" Medienunterschrift Top-Einwanderungsbeamter sagt, dass die öffentliche Anklageregel nicht auf ""eine bestimmte Gruppe"" abzielen wird. Herr Cuccinelli wurde später auf CNN wegen seiner Kommentare unter Druck gesetzt und auf Behauptungen zurückgedrängt, er habe versucht, das Gedicht neu zu schreiben. Er bestand darauf, dass er eine Frage beantworte, und beschuldigte die Leute auf der Linken, seine Kommentare „verdreht"" zu haben. Auf die Frage von Moderatorin Erin Burnett, wofür Amerika stehe, sagte er: „Natürlich bezog sich dieses Gedicht auf Menschen, die aus Europa kamen – woher Sie hatten klassenbasierte Gesellschaften, in denen die Leute es für elend hielten, wenn sie nicht in der richtigen Klasse waren.“ Die beiden diskutierten dann über ihre eigenen Einwanderervorfahren, wobei Frau Burnett darauf hinwies, dass seine Herrschaft ihre Familie „ausgeschlossen“ hätte. „Das bin ich hier, weil sie rein durften, und ich bin ein Anch oder auf CNN“, sagte sie. Beto O’Rouke, ein demokratischer Präsidentschaftskandidat aus Texas, teilte einen Clip aus dem Interview und sagte, die Kommentare zeigten, dass seine Trump-Regierung „glaubt, dass die Freiheitsstatue nur für Weiße gilt“. Diese Regierung hat endlich zugegeben, was wir die ganze Zeit gewusst haben: Sie denken, dass die Freiheitsstatue nur für Weiße gilt. https://t.co/kTLl50yCmw — Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) 14. August 2019 Die BBC ist nicht verantwortlich für den Inhalt externer Websites. Original-Tweet auf Twitter ansehen Wer ist von der neuen Regel betroffen? Einwanderer, die bereits ihren ständigen Wohnsitz in den USA haben, dürften von der Regeländerung kaum betroffen sein. Sie gilt auch nicht für Flüchtlinge und Asylbewerber. Aber Bewerber für Visumverlängerungen, Green Cards oder die US-Staatsbürgerschaft unterliegen der Änderung. Diejenigen, die die Einkommensstandards nicht erfüllen oder von denen angenommen wird, dass sie in Zukunft voraussichtlich auf Leistungen wie Medicaid (staatliche Gesundheitsversorgung) oder Wohngutscheine angewiesen sind, können an der Einreise in das Land gehindert werden. Die Anträge von Personen, die sich bereits in den USA befinden, könnten ebenfalls abgelehnt werden. Schätzungsweise 22 Millionen legale Einwohner der USA haben keine Staatsbürgerschaft, und viele von ihnen werden wahrscheinlich betroffen sein. Präsident Trump hat die Einwanderung zu einem zentralen Thema seiner Regierung gemacht. Dieser jüngste Schritt ist Teil der Bemühungen seiner Regierung, die legale Einwanderung einzudämmen. Wie war die Reaktion? Das von den Demokraten geführte Homeland Security Committee des Repräsentantenhauses verurteilte die Überarbeitung von Herrn Cuccinelli in einem Tweet und nannte die Worte „abscheulich und unamerikanisch“. „Es ist klar, dass die Trump-Administration nur bestimmte Leute fernhalten will“, schrieb das Komitee und nannte Herrn Cuccinelli „eine fremdenfeindliche, einwanderungsfeindliche Randfigur, die in der Regierung nichts zu suchen hat“. Andere wiesen auf seinen Hintergrund als Generalstaatsanwalt von Virginia hin, in dem er eine konservative Kampagne gegen Einwanderung und Homosexualität führte. Auf die Äußerungen von Herrn Cuccinelli am Dienstag angesprochen, antwortete Präsident Trump nicht direkt auf das Zitat der Freiheitsstatue, sondern sagte: „Ich denke nicht, dass es fair ist, wenn die amerikanischen Steuerzahler dafür bezahlen, dass Menschen in die Vereinigten Staaten kommen.“ „Ich bin es leid zu sehen, wie unser Steuerzahler dafür bezahlt, dass Menschen ins Land kommen und sofort Sozialhilfe und verschiedene andere Dinge beziehen."

8469a163	Die Biden-Administration wird bald eine umfassende Antwort auf die Verletzung von SolarWinds liefern, sodass der übliche Verdächtige, Russland, versteht, wo Washington bei Cyberangriffen die Grenze zieht, sagte der nationale Sicherheitsberater der USA, Jake Sullivan. Während seines Auftritts in der CBS-Sendung Face The Nation am Sonntag wurde Sullivan gefragt, was das Team von US-Präsident Joe Biden gegen den SolarWinds-Hack unternehmen würde, da sich Sanktionen gegen Moskau als unwirksam erwiesen haben. Der Berater antwortete, indem er sagte, dass die amerikanische „Antwort eine Mischung aus sichtbaren und unsichtbaren Werkzeugen beinhalten wird“. Er hat nicht spezifiziert, was diese „Werkzeuge“ sein könnten. Und es werden nicht nur Sanktionen sein, denn wie Sie sagten, erfordert eine Reaktion auf eine Reihe von Aktivitäten wie diese ein umfassenderes Instrumentarium, und genau das beabsichtigt die Regierung. Auch auf rt.com Wieder mit dem „Wahrscheinlichen“: US-Spione beschuldigen Russland des SolarWinds-Hacks in Wiederholung der Russiagate-Hysterie „Es wird Wochen, nicht Monate dauern“, bis die USA Vergeltungsmaßnahmen gegen Russland vorbereiten, erklärte Sullivan. Wir werden sicherstellen, dass Russland versteht, wo die USA bei dieser Art von Aktivität die Grenze ziehen. Die Verletzung von SolarWinds wurde im Dezember gemeldet und entwickelte sich zu einem der bisher größten und raffiniertesten Cyberangriffe. Die Hacker konnten Software-Hintertüren in ein weit verbreitetes Netzwerkverwaltungsprogramm einfügen, das von der in Texas ansässigen Firma SolarWinds vertrieben wird. Dadurch konnten sie die Systeme von mehr als 100 Handelsunternehmen weltweit sowie von neun US-Regierungsbehörden kompromittieren, wobei die Verletzung erst acht oder neun Monate später entdeckt wurde.

38a5453c	Dan O’Donnell taucht in neue Daten der Wisconsin Elections Commission ein, die eine erstaunliche Anomalie in der Ablehnungsrate von Briefwahlen in diesem November zeigen. 3. Februar 2021 Perspektive von Dan O’Donnell Es ist heutzutage ein gefährliches Unterfangen, jeden Aspekt der Präsidentschaftswahlen im November in Frage zu stellen. Einer kann von den sozialen Medien ausgeschlossen oder für einen Aufruhr im US-Kapitol verantwortlich gemacht werden, selbst wenn er andeutet, dass es Unregelmäßigkeiten geben könnte, die weitere Untersuchungen rechtfertigen. Es ist jedoch alles andere als verschwörungsfördernd, die Realität zu akzeptieren, dass die Verantwortlichen für die Verwaltung der Landtagswahlen hier in Wisconsin bei jeder erdenklichen Gelegenheit den Daumen auf die Waage legen. Die Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) verstieß gegen staatliches Recht, indem sie sich weigerte, 234.000 Namen aus den Wählerverzeichnissen zu streichen, und indem sie sowohl Kanye West als auch die Grünen von der Abstimmung fernhielt, damit sie nicht als Spoiler für den späteren Sieger Joe Biden dienen konnten. Beamte aus Milwaukee und Dane County verstießen gegen das Gesetz des Bundesstaates, indem sie den Wählern sagten, dass sie eine unbefristete Haft fordern könnten (und damit die Anforderungen an die Wählerausweise umgehen), selbst wenn sie selbst nicht tatsächlich auf ihre Häuser beschränkt wären. Die Stadt Madison verstieß gegen das Gesetz des Bundesstaates, indem sie in jedem ihrer Stadtparks eine Veranstaltung zur Stimmzettelernte abhielt (für die die Biden-Kampagne tatsächlich geworben hatte). Jetzt scheint es wahrscheinlich, dass sich Wahlbeamte im ganzen Staat geweigert haben, Stimmzettel abzulehnen, die sie normalerweise hätten (und wahrscheinlich rechtlich hätten haben sollen). Der neu veröffentlichte Wahldatenbericht der WEC enthüllt eine erstaunliche Anomalie, die sich sonst kaum erklären lässt: Trotz eines massiven Anstiegs der Briefwahl in diesem November ist der Prozentsatz der abgelehnten Stimmzettel auf nahezu null gesunken. Nur 4.270 Briefwahlzettel von 1.969.274 abgegebenen Stimmen wurden abgelehnt – eine Quote von 0,2 %. Dies widerspricht sowohl der Logik als auch dem gesunden Menschenverstand. Bei den Präsidentschaftswahlen im November wurden etwa doppelt so viele Briefwahlstimmen abgegeben wie bei den Wahlen im Frühjahr 2016, doch bei dieser Wahl vor vier Jahren lag die Ablehnungsquote bei 2,5 %. Wenn weit mehr Menschen Briefwahlstimmen abgeben würden (und vermutlich zum ersten Mal), würde es naheliegend sein, dass auch die Anzahl der Fehler, die zur Ablehnung von Stimmzetteln führen, steigen würde. Stattdessen sind diese Fehler so gut wie verschwunden. Unglaublich kleine 0,07 % der Stimmzettel (insgesamt 1.434) wurden wegen unzureichender Stimmzettelbeglaubigung abgelehnt. Noch weniger 0,05 % (insgesamt 1.045) wurden abgelehnt, weil sie nach Abschluss der Wahllokale eingingen. Und mikroskopisch kleine 0,002 % (nur 42 insgesamt) wurden abgelehnt, weil der Wahlumschlag irgendwie kompromittiert war. Dies ist fast unmöglich zu erklären, zumal die Ablehnungsrate von Stimmzetteln nur sieben Monate zuvor bei den Frühjahrswahlen in Wisconsin bei 1,8 % lag, als ein damaliger Rekord von 1.101.474 Briefwahlzetteln abgegeben wurde. Trotz eines Anstiegs von 78 % bei der Zahl der abgegebenen Briefwahlzettel im November ging die Zahl der abgelehnten Stimmzettel um 78 % zurück. Haben Hunderttausende Wisconsiniter plötzlich herausgefunden, wie sie ihre Stimmzettel richtig ausfüllen? Oder wurde gezielt versucht, möglichst viele Stimmzettel auszuzählen, ohne Rücksicht darauf, ob sie richtig ausgefüllt wurden? Die Beweise deuten auf Letzteres hin. Die Ablehnungsrate von Stimmzetteln bei den Präsidentschaftsvorwahlen im April 2016 betrug 2,5 % mit einer Ablehnungsrate von 1,4 % im darauffolgenden November, obwohl weitaus weniger Briefwahlzettel zurückgegeben wurden als im Präsidentschaftswahlzyklus 2020. Die Ablehnungsrate im April 2020 lag mit 1,8 % deutlich im normalen Bereich, fiel dann aber plötzlich auf winzige 0,2 %. Interessanterweise sank bei den Gouverneurswahlen im November 2018 – die ebenfalls von Betrugsvorwürfen verfolgt wurden, nachdem ein plötzlicher Zustrom von Briefwahlstimmen in Milwaukee Gouverneur Tony Evers an Scott Walker vorbeigetrieben hatte – die Ablehnungsquote von Briefwahlstimmen plötzlich auf 0,2 %. Wie hoch wären die Chancen, dass bei den beiden landesweiten Wahlen, bei denen unbeliebte Republikaner (Walker und Donald Trump) auf dem Stimmzettel standen und beide aufgrund des enormen Anstiegs der Briefwahl verloren, plötzlich keine Stimmzettel mehr abgelehnt würden? Angesichts der Tatsache, dass die Wahlkommission von Wisconsin seit 2016 rechtswidrig den örtlichen Angestellten auffordert, problematische Stimmzettel zu reparieren, anstatt sie den Wählern zurückzugeben, wie es die staatlichen Gesetze erfordern, scheint es, als ob es die WEC-Politik gewesen wäre (obwohl sie rechtswidrig ist), so viele fragwürdige Stimmen zu bekommen Stimmzettel werden wie möglich ausgezählt. Dies erklärt jedoch nicht den plötzlichen und dramatischen Rückgang der Stimmzettelablehnungsraten nur bei den Gouverneurswahlen 2018 und den Präsidentschaftswahlen 2020. Entweder haben die Wähler die Regeln für die Rückgabe von Stimmzetteln nur in diesen beiden Rennen außergewöhnlich gut herausgefunden, oder Angestellte und Wahlhelfer hatten eine konzertierte Anstrengung, um so wenige Stimmzettel wie möglich abzulehnen, um rechtswidrig zu versuchen, demokratische Herausforderer bei ihrem Versuch zu unterstützen, republikanische Amtsinhaber zu stürzen, die die Angestellten und Wahlhelfer verachtet. In jedem Fall erfordert diese erstaunlich niedrige Ablehnungsquote bei einer Rekordzahl von Briefwahlzetteln eine sofortige und gründliche Untersuchung.

ca53fa81	"TEILEN By of the Sun Prairie – Da die Wirtschaft immer noch Probleme hat und seine eigenen politischen Aussichten in der Schwebe sind, sagte Gouverneur Scott Walker am Mittwoch, er werde einen parteiübergreifenden Ansatz für eine zweite Sondersitzung zu Arbeitsgesetzen anstreben. Walker sagte, der Gesetzgeber sollte sich auf Jobs wie einen Laserstrahl konzentrieren, und sagte, er wolle bis November etwa 30 Gesetzesvorlagen verabschieden, die sowohl von Republikanern als auch von Demokraten verfasst wurden und auf alles abzielen, von Biotech-Unternehmen bis hin zu Landwirtschafts- und Speditionsunternehmen. Aber Verbraucherschützer und Demokraten erhoben sofort rote Fahnen zu einigen der Rechtsvorschriften und stellten fest, dass eine Gesetzesvorlage Familien und kleine Unternehmen dazu verpflichten würde, niedrigere Stromtarife für große Hersteller zu subventionieren, andere Gesetzesvorlagen waren immer noch nur Entwürfe, und einige – was die Vorschriften für alles lockern würde von Piers bis zu Feuchtgebieten - würde nicht unbedingt Arbeitsplätze schaffen. Im Moment umfasst die Sondersitzung nicht die beiden wichtigsten Gesetze zur wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung – einen Gesetzentwurf zur Förderung von Risikokapitalinvestitionen und einen weiteren zur Neufassung der staatlichen Bergbauvorschriften und des Genehmigungsverfahrens. „Wir wollen es nur all den Leuten erleichtern, die nach Wisconsin kommen und wachsen und expandieren wollen … weg von all dem anderen Kram, all den anderen Themen, die rund um das Kapitol diskutiert werden und uns davon ablenken“, sagte Walker sagte bei der Firma Thermal Spray Technologies. In seiner Rede schlug Walker einen versöhnlichen Ton an und stellte fest, dass viele Stellengesetze in einer Sondersitzung im Januar überparteiliche Unterstützung erhielten. Der Aufruf, sich wieder auf Arbeitsplätze zu konzentrieren, folgt auf einen Frühling, der von einer kontroversen Debatte über die Aufhebung der meisten Tarifverhandlungen für öffentliche Beschäftigte durch den republikanischen Gouverneur dominiert wurde, und auf einen Sommer, der von Neuwahlen gegen neun Senatoren der Bundesstaaten wegen ihrer Haltung zu dieser Gesetzgebung überschattet wurde. Bisher halten die Meinungsverschiedenheiten an, wobei der Mehrheitsführer des Senats, Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau), am Dienstag den ungewöhnlichen Schritt unternahm, sich zu weigern, die vom Minderheitsführer Mark Miller (D-Monona) empfohlenen Senatoren in ein Bergbaukomitee zu ernennen. In diesem Jahr war das wirtschaftliche Bild in Wisconsin und im ganzen Land gemischt. Der Staat hat zwischen Dezember und August netto insgesamt 30.100 Arbeitsplätze geschaffen, nachdem saisonale Unterschiede bei der Einstellung berücksichtigt wurden, aber die Arbeitslosenquote ist von 7,5 % auf 7,9 % gestiegen. Die Demokraten begrüßten die Fokussierung auf Arbeitsplätze, stellten jedoch die Frage, ob einige der Gesetzentwürfe, beispielsweise eines, das sich mit Pfeilern befasste, und andere zur Begrenzung von Klagen, dieses Ziel erreichen würden. Sie fragten, ob die Rechnungen Teil einer Sondersitzung sein sollten, damit sie möglicherweise schneller verschoben werden können. „Wir wollen, dass Gesetzesentwürfe beschleunigt werden, die Arbeitsplätze schaffen. Wir wollen, dass Gesetzesentwürfe verlangsamt werden, die derzeit keine Aussicht auf die Schaffung von Arbeitsplätzen haben“, sagte Peter Barca (D-Kenosha), der Minderheitsführer der Versammlung, der einen der Gesetzesentwürfe hat Die Liste. Stromtarife Der Gesetzentwurf über Stromnachlässe wird von republikanischen Gesetzgebern als Instrument angepriesen, um Wisconsins Wirtschaft beim Wachstum zu unterstützen. Die Rechnung würde ein Pilotprogramm erweitern, um Mercury Marine über fünf Jahre einen Rabatt von fast 5 Millionen US-Dollar anzubieten, das letzte Stück eines mehr als 120 Millionen US-Dollar umfassenden Finanzierungspakets auf staatlicher und lokaler Ebene, das dem Motorenhersteller Fond du Lac half, sich gegen einen Umzug zu entscheiden nach Oklahoma. Charlie Higley, Exekutivdirektor des Citizens' Utility Board der Steuerzahlergruppe, widersprach einer Pressemitteilung von Walkers Büro, in der der Gesetzentwurf als ""Steuererleichterung"" bezeichnet wurde, und sagte, dass er sich mit Versorgungsgebühren befasse und nichts mit Steuern zu tun habe. Higley sagte, dass die vorgeschlagenen niedrigeren Sätze für bestimmte große Hersteller am Ende durch eine im Wesentlichen versteckte Gebühr für andere Verbraucher bezahlt würden. „Das ist seit über 100 Jahren verboten, weil es einfach unfair ist, Steuerzahler für Rabatte bezahlen zu lassen, die an andere Steuerzahler gehen“, sagte Higley. Ein Wirtschaftsverband der größten Stromverbraucher des Landes unterstützte den Vorschlag. Der Gesetzentwurf ""würde unsere Wettbewerbsfähigkeit steigern und die Bemühungen zur Schaffung von Arbeitsplätzen in Wisconsin unterstützen. Viele andere regulierte Staaten im ganzen Land bieten ähnliche Programme als Teil ihrer wirtschaftlichen Entwicklungs-Toolkits an"", sagte Todd Stuart, Executive Director der Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group. Die Ankündigung, die die Rechnung am Mittwoch hervorhob, kam einen Tag, bevor die staatliche Public Service Commission, die von zwei von Walker ernannten Personen kontrolliert wird, darüber abstimmen soll, ob die Stromrechnungsrabatte an Mercury Marine vergeben werden sollen. Rabatte für den Motorenhersteller wurden als Teil eines Pakets angekündigt, das Finanzmittel von Staat, Landkreis und Stadt umfasste, um Mercury davon zu überzeugen, seine Produktion nicht von Wisconsin nach Stillwater, Okla, zu verlegen Stimulus und lokale Finanzierung, aber Alliants Antrag auf Preisnachlass für Mercury wurde nie genehmigt. Es wurde vom Citizens' Utility Board herausgefordert, aber von Stuarts Gruppe unterstützt. Bei einer öffentlichen Anhörung im Mai zum Stromtarifgesetz schlossen sich We Energies und die Municipal Electric Utilities of Wisconsin der CUB an, um Bedenken hinsichtlich der Auswirkungen der Stromtarifgesetzgebung auf kleine Unternehmen zu äußern, die Rabatte für größere Unternehmen finanzieren würden. Aber Wisconsin Power & Light und die Hersteller unterstützten das Gesetz und sagten, es würde Wisconsin helfen, Unternehmen anzuziehen, indem es ihm ein Werkzeug gibt, das andere Staaten, einschließlich Iowa und Minnesota, haben. Der Abgeordnete Mark Honadel (R-South Milwaukee) sagte am Mittwoch, der Gesetzentwurf werde überarbeitet, um die bei der Anhörung geäußerten Bedenken auszuräumen. Ein weiterer Vorschlag, der von Walker Wednesday hervorgehoben wurde, würde ein Programm zur Vergabe von Zuschüssen und Darlehen an Biotech-Unternehmen schaffen. Diese würden bezahlt, indem das Wachstum der Einkommensteuern, die Unternehmen in diesem Sektor für ihre Arbeitnehmer einbehalten, umgeleitet würden. Dieser Gesetzesentwurf würde auf 50 Millionen Dollar pro Jahr begrenzt und über die Laufzeit des Programms 15 Jahre oder 500 Millionen Dollar laufen. Feuchtgebietsrechnung Walkers Liste enthielt auch Gesetzesentwürfe, um den Bau von Feuchtgebieten zu ermöglichen, wenn an anderen Orten neue Feuchtgebiete angelegt werden. Rep. Brett Hulsey (D-Madison) sagte, dass er glaubt, dass der Gesetzentwurf es einfacher machen würde, sogenannte „Feuchtgebietsminderung“ zuzulassen – das Verschieben von Feuchtgebieten von einem Ort zum anderen. Er sagte, er befürchte, es sei eine Hintertür, um dem Bergbauunternehmen Gogebic Taconite aus Hurley zu helfen, das den Bau einer großen Eisenerzmine in den Grafschaften Ashland und Iron vorschlägt. Aber Gegner des aktuellen Gesetzes sagen, dass das Ministerium für natürliche Ressourcen die kommerzielle Entwicklung lange gehemmt hat, indem es die Möglichkeiten für Feuchtgebiete eingeschränkt hat. Dan Johnson, ein Adjutant von Senator Neal Kedzie (R-Elkhorn), einem Co-Sponsor der Gesetzgebung, sagte, das Feuchtgebietsgesetz habe nichts mit Bergbau zu tun. Ein weiterer Gesetzentwurf würde Änderungen daran vornehmen, wie Wisconsin den Bau und die Größe von Piers auf öffentlichen Wasserstraßen und Großvater in allen bestehenden Docks an Seen und Flüssen regelt. Die Regulierung der Piers war ebenfalls umstritten, wobei der DNR unter der Verwaltung des ehemaligen Gouverneurs Jim Doyle sagte, dass Änderungen erforderlich seien, um den empfindlichen Küstenbereich von Gewässern zu schützen, und Eigentümer sagten, sie sollten in der Lage sein, langjährige Piers zu behalten. Die im Jahr 2008 genehmigten Vorschriften haben die meisten, aber nicht alle Piers überholt, als der Staat neue Standards für die Größe neuer Docks festlegte. In diesem Frühjahr gewährte der Gesetzgeber den Pierbesitzern ein weiteres Jahr, um die Frist zur Einhaltung der Vorschriften von 2008 einzuhalten. Die neue Frist ist der 1. April 2012. Demokraten wie Barca stellten in Frage, wie dieser Vorschlag überhaupt Arbeitsplätze schaffen könnte. Walker-Sprecher Chris Schrimpf sagte, es handele sich um eine Maßnahme zur Straffung der Regulierung, an der „lange gearbeitet wurde und die als Teil eines Gesamtpakets sinnvoll eingeführt werden sollte“. Jason Stein berichtete für diesen Artikel in Sun Prairie und Thomas Content in Milwaukee. Lee Bergquist von den Mitarbeitern des Journal Sentinel hat zu diesem Bericht beigetragen."

fdddd52c	"Behörden in Australien haben bestätigt, dass die Buschbrände durch Brandstifter und eine Reihe von Blitzeinschlägen verursacht wurden, nicht durch den „Klimawandel“, wie viele Aktivisten behaupteten. Seit November haben die Brände verschiedene Regionen in New South Wales verwüstet, Tausende von Gebäuden zerstört und mindestens 22 Menschen getötet. Summit.news berichtet: Trotz der Tatsache, dass Buschbrände in Australien keine Seltenheit sind, veranlasste die Schwere der Schäden zahlreiche Alarmisten des Klimawandels, die menschengemachte globale Erwärmung für die Katastrophe verantwortlich zu machen.
Anfang dieser Woche beschuldigte Bernie Sanders diejenigen, die „Maßnahmen gegen den Klimawandel verzögerten“, für „den blutroten Himmel und die unatmbare Luft in Australien wegen wütender Waldbrände“. Laut den mit der Untersuchung der Brände beauftragten Personen hat der Klimawandel jedoch nichts damit zu tun. @7NewsDie Polizei von Sydney arbeitet jetzt an der Prämisse, dass Brandstiftung für einen Großteil der Verwüstung verantwortlich ist, die diese Buschfeuersaison verursacht hat. Eine Einsatztruppe wird untersuchen, ob die Flammen absichtlich gelegt wurden, und die Verantwortlichen vor Gericht stellen. http://7NEWS.com.au @ebatten7 #NSWFires #7NEWS Eingebettetes Video „Die Polizei arbeitet jetzt an der Prämisse, dass Brandstiftung für einen Großteil der Verwüstung verantwortlich ist, die diese Buschfeuersaison verursacht hat“, berichtet 7 News Sydney. Die Behörden des Landes haben die Strike Force Indarra gebildet, die sich aus Ermittlern von Mord- und Brandstiftungseinheiten zusammensetzt, um die Schuldigen zu finden. Andere Ursachen für die Brände sind Blitzeinschläge und ein natürliches Wetterphänomen namens Dipole, die ebenfalls nichts mit dem menschengemachten Klimawandel zu tun haben. Viele Buschbrände werden auch tatsächlich durch umweltbewusste „grüne“ Richtlinien verursacht, die Landbesitzer daran hindern, ihre eigene Vegetation zu roden, um sich zu schützen. „Regierungen, die das grüne Biest besänftigen, haben in den letzten zehn Jahren zahlreiche staatliche und bundesstaatliche Anfragen zu Buschbränden ignoriert, von denen fast alle empfohlen haben, die Praxis des „vorgeschriebenen Abbrennens“ zu verstärken“, schreibt Miranda Devine. „Auch als „Gefahrenminderung“ bekannt, ist es ein methodisches Regime, brennbare Bodenbeläge in kühleren Monaten kontrolliert abzubrennen, damit die unvermeidlichen Buschbrände im Sommer nicht angeheizt werden.“ Wie immer bei Alarmisten des Klimawandels lassen sie die Tatsachen einer guten Machtübernahme nicht im Wege stehen."

Die Zahl der NHS-Krankenhausbetten ist in den letzten zehn Jahren um 20 % gesunken und hat das Gesundheitswesen an einen „Belastungspunkt“ gebracht, warnte die British Medical Association. Eine Analyse des BMA ergab, dass die Zahl der Übernachtungsbetten in englischen Krankenhäusern zwischen 2006/7 und 2015/16 um ein Fünftel gesunken ist. Der BMA-Vorsitzende Mark Porter sagte: „Großbritannien hat bereits die zweitniedrigste Anzahl von Krankenhausbetten pro Kopf in Europa, und diese Zahlen zeichnen ein noch düstereres Bild eines NHS, der am Bruchpunkt steht. „Eine hohe Bettenbelegung ist ein Symptom für den größeren Druck und die Nachfrage auf einem überlasteten und unterfinanzierten System. Es führt zu Verzögerungen bei Aufnahmen, Operationen, die abgesagt werden, und Patienten, die zu Unrecht und manchmal wiederholt im Stich gelassen werden.“ Der neue Bericht des BMA ergab, dass in der ersten Januarwoche dieses Jahres fast drei Viertel der Stiftungen an mindestens einem Tag eine Bettenauslastung von 95 % hatten. Der Analyse zufolge gab es im Jahr 2000 durchschnittlich 3,8 Betten pro 1.000 Einwohner, aber dieser Wert war bis 2015 auf 2,4 Betten gesunken. Bild: Universal Images Group Dem Bericht zufolge verbrachten im November 2016 14,8 % der Patienten mehr als vier Stunden Warten auf ein Krankenhausbett, nachdem sie in einer Notaufnahme gesehen wurden. „Die Daten zeigen den zunehmenden Druck auf das System“, sagte Dr. Porter. „Es liefert Beweise für die zugrunde liegenden Risse innerhalb des NHS, wie z. B. Finanzierungsengpässe, Veränderungen und steigende Nachfrage, unzusammenhängende Pflege und Personaldruck“, heißt es in dem BMA-Bericht. Es stellte fest, dass der Druck auf die psychiatrischen Dienste besonders akut war, da die Zahl der psychiatrischen Betten seit 2000/01 um 44 % zurückgegangen ist. Das Dokument wurde von Oppositionspolitikern beschlagnahmt, wobei Labour sagte, es sei ein „Weckruf, den Theresa May nicht ignorieren darf“, und die Liberaldemokraten warnten, die Situation werde „unerträglich“. Bild: Moment RF Shadow-Gesundheitsminister Jonathan Ashworth sagte: „Dank Torys Misshandlung unseres NHS liegen die Patientenzahlen in Krankenhäusern jetzt routinemäßig über den aus Sicherheitsgründen empfohlenen Werten. Die beschämende Realität ist, dass diese Überfüllung Patienten gefährdet und die Behauptungen der Minister, der Sicherheit Vorrang einzuräumen, zunichte macht. „Die Zahl der Krankenhausbetten für Übernachtungen ist um über ein Fünftel zurückgegangen, und zusammen mit der Vernachlässigung durch die Torys und der Unterfinanzierung hat dies dazu geführt, dass neun von zehn Krankenhäusern diesen Winter gefährlich überfüllt sind.“ Der Sprecher von Lib Dem und ehemaliger Gesundheitsminister Norman Lamb fügte hinzu: „Chronische Bettenknappheit sollte die Ausnahme und nicht die Regel sein. „Die Situation wird unerträglich, mit mehr abgesagten Operationen, längeren Verzögerungen und systematischer Enttäuschung von Menschen mit psychischen Problemen. „Die Regierung finanziert den NHS nicht angemessen, und die Patienten zahlen den Preis.“ Eine Sprecherin von NHS Improvement sagte: „Der NHS stand in diesem Winter unter großem Druck, da er mit einem Anstieg der Nachfrage nach Rettungsdiensten fertig wird, deren Auswirkungen in allen unseren Krankenhäusern zu spüren sind. „Unsere Krankenhäuser sind sehr ausgelastet, aber wir arbeiten unermüdlich mit den Anbietern zusammen, um sie bei der Verwaltung und effizienteren Nutzung der verfügbaren Betten zu unterstützen.“	Staat weise, das Schicksal des Gesundheitsreformgesetzes abzuwarten	partially false
5ce4da20	Nach 35 Tagen wegen Vandalismus wurde das Gedenkschild von Emmett Till wieder mit Einschusslöchern übersät. Was wir wissen: Das Emmett Till Memorial wurde vom Emmett Till Interpretive Center errichtet und befindet sich außerhalb von Glendale, Mississippi. Laut TIME Magazine ist dies das dritte Mal, dass das Schild zerstört wurde. Es war traurig, vorzufahren und es so zu sehen“, sagte Patrick Weems, Gründer des Emmett Till Interpretive Center in Sumner, Miss. „Als wir es schließlich ersetzten, war es ein erstaunliches Gefühl, dass dieses Schild ausgelöscht worden war wurde endlich wiederhergestellt.“ Das Denkmal wurde zu Ehren des 14-jährigen Till errichtet, der von zwei Weißen gelyncht, geschlagen und gefoltert und dann in den Fluss Tallahatchie geworfen wurde. Er wurde von einer weißen Frau, Carolyn Bryant, beschuldigt, sie angepfiffen zu haben. Die Männer wurden von seinem Mord freigesprochen, und sie widerrief ihre Geschichte Jahrzehnte später nach Tills Tod. Erst 2007, 52 Jahre nach Tills Tod, erhielt er sein erstes Gedenkschild. Es dauerte nur ein Jahr, bevor das Schild gestohlen wurde und nie zurückkam, berichtet die New York Times. Mehrere Schilder wurden ersetzt, seit das erste gestohlen wurde. Ein weiteres wurde ebenfalls erschossen, und das neueste Schild wurde im Juni ersetzt. Niemand wurde jemals wegen Zerstörung der Schilder erwischt, aber Herr Weems sagt: „Meiner Meinung nach braucht es nur eine Person, um dies zu tun.“ Herr Weems sagt, dass es Gespräche über ein neues Schild gibt, das entworfen und aus Stahl hergestellt wird, um besser als zuvor zu sein. Die Emmett Till Foundation setzt ihre Reise fort, um sein Vermächtnis zu bewahren.

dd4501d6	"Der erste Monat des Rookie-Politikers sieht seinem Wahlkampf sehr ähnlich. Der Kongressabgeordnete Conor Lamb war eine unbekannte Größe, als er im März eine Sonderwahl gewann, die er nicht gewinnen sollte, da er als Demokrat kandidierte, den sogar Reagan-Anhänger lieben konnten, und sich weigerte, sich vollständig der Parteilinie zu unterwerfen. Es war eine Frage, wie sich das alles in einem gewählten Amt niederschlagen würde. Er hatte keine politische Erfahrung und keine Abstimmungsergebnisse, auf die er verweisen konnte, und nur Plattformpunkte und Wahlgelübde, die als Referenzmaterial dienten. Einen Monat später, und das hat sich geändert. In den ersten Wochen dieser sehr kurzen Amtszeit als Vertreter des 18. Kongressbezirks – von dem Teile zu den Grafschaften Allegheny, Westmoreland, Greene und Washington gehören – hat Lamb mit seinen Demokraten im Repräsentantenhaus und zeitweise mit der republikanischen Mehrheit abgestimmt . Er hat für Maßnahmen zur Ausweitung des Schutzes vor Hasskriminalität auf Strafverfolgungsbeamte und gegen ein Farm Bill gestimmt, das umstrittene neue Arbeitsanforderungen für Empfänger von Lebensmittelmarken enthält. Er hat mit dem Kongressabgeordneten Keith Rothfus, Lambs republikanischem Gegner im laufenden Rennen um Pennsylvanias neu gezogenen 17. Kongressbezirk, und gegen ihn gestimmt. Die Frage ist also: Wenn Lamb als politischer Querdenker, als gemäßigt in unmäßigen Zeiten, angepriesen wurde, spiegelt sich das in seiner Abstimmungsbilanz wider? Hier sehen wir uns die Stimmen an, die Lamb in seinen ersten Wochen im Amt abgegeben hat, und sehen voraus, wie seine Stimmen als dauerhafteres Mitglied des US-Repräsentantenhauses aussehen könnten, wenn er gewählt wird, um den 17. im November zu vertreten. Mehrere Anfragen nach Kommentaren wurden nicht beantwortet.

Die Volcker-Regel wurde 2010 unter Präsident Barack Obama als Teil des Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act verabschiedet und sollte Bankkunden schützen, indem sie Institute daran hinderte, bestimmte Arten von spekulativen Investitionen zu tätigen, die zur Finanzkrise 2008 beitrugen. Laut der New York Times „verbot die Volcker-Regel, benannt nach dem ehemaligen Vorsitzenden der Federal Reserve […], den Banken, ihre eigenen riskanten Wetten mit den Einlagen ihrer Kunden einzugehen. Die Banken verabscheuten die Regel und die Republikaner schworen, sie rückgängig zu machen.“ Der Gesetzentwurf funktioniert, indem er Tausenden von kleinen und mittelgroßen Banken ermöglicht, sich einer strengeren Aufsicht zu entziehen, und laut der Washington Post „auch Regeln lockert, die darauf abzielen, die größten Banken vor einem plötzlichen Zusammenbruch zu schützen“. Die Post berichtete auch, dass Paul Volcker, der ehemalige Fed-Vorsitzende, nach dem die Regel benannt ist, einen ähnlichen Gesetzentwurf im US-Senat kritisierte und sagte, „plausibel kleine Schlupflöcher können ‚gespielt‘ und mit unglücklichen Folgen ausgenutzt werden.“ Am Ende gelang es den Republikanern im Kongress mit Hilfe von Demokraten wie Lamb, der als einer von 78 Demokraten für die Rücknahme stimmte. Laut govtrack.us haben 115 Demokraten gegen die Regeländerung gestimmt oder überhaupt nicht gestimmt. Wie hat Lamb abgestimmt? Lamb stimmte dafür, die Regel rückgängig zu machen, und sagte später in einem Rathaus, dass seine Stimme auf der Belastung der Verordnung für kleinere Banken beruhe, die seiner Meinung nach nicht die Art von riskantem Handel betreiben, wie die großen Banken vor der Finanzkrise 2008, berichtete TribLive. Gemäß dem Gesetzentwurf werden Gemeinschaftsbanken definiert als solche ohne beherrschende Einheit mit einem konsolidierten Gesamtvermögen von 10 Milliarden US-Dollar oder mehr und einem gesamten Handelsvermögen und Handelsverbindlichkeiten, die mehr als 5 Prozent des gesamten konsolidierten Vermögens ausmachen. Wie hat Rothfus abgestimmt? Auch Rothfus stimmte für den Rollback. Wo steht es? Der Gesetzentwurf wurde vom Repräsentantenhaus verabschiedet und laut congress.gov an den Ausschuss für Banken, Wohnungswesen und städtische Angelegenheiten verwiesen. S. 2155 – Wirtschaftswachstums-, Ordnungsentlastungs- und Konsumentenschutzgesetz Was ist das? Der Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act ist eine umfassendere Rücknahme der Dodd-Frank-Bestimmungen. Es zielt darauf ab, „die regulatorische Belastung für kleine und mittlere Banken zu verringern“, dieselben Banken, die argumentieren, dass die strengeren Vorschriften, die durch die Finanzkrise von 2008 angespornt wurden, es ihnen zu Unrecht erschwert haben, zu operieren und zu konkurrieren. Dazu gehören Gemeinschaftsbanken, zu deren Kunden kleine Unternehmen gehören, die laut Kritikern von Dodd-Frank durch die eingeschränkte Kreditvergabe an kleine Unternehmen nach der Verabschiedung von Dodd-Frank im Jahr 2010 geschädigt wurden. Kritiker des Gesetzes über Wirtschaftswachstum, regulatorische Erleichterungen und Verbraucherschutz, argumentieren Sie unterdessen, dass dies einige der schlimmsten Tendenzen des Finanzsektors verstärken könnte, dieselben, die zum Finanzkollaps von 2008 beigetragen oder ihn verursacht haben. Wie hat Lamb abgestimmt? Lamb stimmte gegen die Maßnahme und schloss sich der großen Mehrheit der Demokraten an. In einer Pressemitteilung sagte Lamb über den Gesetzentwurf: „Mit vernünftigen Vorschriften zum Schutz des von Verbrauchern eingezahlten Geldes können die Menschen mehr darauf vertrauen, dass ihre Bank ihre Investitionen besser schützt. Banken erzielen heute Rekordgewinne und es ist nur fair, dass wir weiterhin die Interessen der Steuerzahler schützen und eine weitere Rettungsaktion vermeiden.“ WESA beschrieb dies als Lamb, der „mit zwei Stimmen zu den Bankregeln die parteiische Kluft überbrückt“. Wie hat Rothfus abgestimmt? Rothfus stimmte für die Maßnahme und schloss sich fast allen seinen Republikanern an. In einer Erklärung sagte Rothfus: „Seit dem Ende der Finanzkrise haben wir jeden Tag durchschnittlich eine Gemeinschaftsbank oder Kreditgenossenschaft verschwinden sehen. Dies hat dazu geführt, dass die Verbraucher mit höheren Kosten und einem eingeschränkten Zugang zu wichtigen Finanzprodukten konfrontiert waren. Durch die Korrektur fehlgeleiteter Regeln aus Washington wird dieser Gesetzentwurf Verbrauchern und kleinen Unternehmen helfen, Zugang zu den Finanzdienstleistungen zu erhalten, die sie benötigen, um ihre Version des amerikanischen Traums zu leben.“ Wo steht es? Präsident Trump unterzeichnete das Gesetz am Donnerstag. HR 5698 – Protect and Serve Act von 2018 Was ist das? Der Protect and Serve Act von 2018 ist einem Bundesgesetz über Hassverbrechen nachempfunden und würde es zu einem Verbrechen machen, einen Strafverfolgungsbeamten absichtlich auf der Grundlage seines „tatsächlichen oder vermeintlichen Status“ als einer anzugreifen, berichtet CNN. Befürworter sagen, der Gesetzentwurf sende ein klares Signal, dass Gewalt gegen Vollzugsbeamte nicht toleriert werde. Kritiker sagen, die Sprache des Gesetzentwurfs sei zu weit gefasst und bezeichne jede Gewalt gegen Beamte effektiv als Hassverbrechen des Bundes. Sie argumentieren auch, dass dies ein falsches Narrativ eines „Krieges gegen die Polizei“ verewigt und dass die Polizei bereits durch staatliches und bundesstaatliches Recht erheblichen Schutz genießt und nicht als historisch verfolgte Gruppe qualifiziert ist. Wie hat Lamb abgestimmt? Lamb, dessen Hintergrund als Bundesstaatsanwalt und JAG-Offizier des Marine Corps regelmäßiger Bestandteil seiner Kampagne war, stimmte für den Gesetzentwurf. Sein Büro reagierte nicht sofort auf eine Bitte um Stellungnahme. Laut govtrack.us war er einer von 162 Demokraten, die für das Gesetz gestimmt haben, während 24 dagegen und sieben nicht gestimmt haben. Wie hat Rothfus abgestimmt? Auch Rothfus stimmte für die Maßnahme. Es gab 220 Republikaner, die Ja-Stimmen für das Gesetz gaben, 11, die dies nicht taten, und drei, die überhaupt nicht stimmten. Alle Sponsoren des Gesetzentwurfs waren Republikaner. Wo steht es? Der Gesetzentwurf wurde vom Repräsentantenhaus verabschiedet und an den Justizausschuss des Senats verwiesen. HR 2152 – Bürgerrechtsgesetz von 2018 Was ist das? Dieser Gesetzentwurf verlangt von einer staatlichen oder lokalen Regierung, die Mittel im Rahmen eines Zuschussprogramms des Justizministeriums (DOJ) erhält und diese Mittel für ein Programm für vorgerichtliche Dienstleistungen verwendet, dem DOJ jährlich den für das Programm für vorgerichtliche Dienstleistungen zugewiesenen Geldbetrag und bestimmte Informationen über die Teilnahme zu melden Angeklagte. Das DOJ muss die Informationen veröffentlichen. Darüber hinaus muss das DOJ die Zuweisung von Zuschüssen einer staatlichen oder lokalen Regierung reduzieren, die sich nicht daran hält. Befürworter argumentieren, dass der Gesetzentwurf mehr Transparenz darüber schaffen würde, wie Bundesmittel von den lokalen Regierungen verwendet werden. Kritiker, darunter ACLU, NAACP und Human Rights Watch, sagen, dass der Gesetzentwurf „ernsthafte Bedenken hinsichtlich des Datenschutzes“ aufwirft und „Bemühungen untergräbt, die Abhängigkeit der Gerichtsbarkeiten von Geldkautionssystemen zu beseitigen oder zu verringern“. Wie hat Lamb abgestimmt? Lamb stimmte gegen die Maßnahme und schloss sich einer Mehrheit der Demokraten an. Wie hat Rothfus abgestimmt? Rothfus stimmte mit Ja, zusammen mit allen außer 8 republikanischen Wählern im Repräsentantenhaus. Was ist passiert? Der Gesetzentwurf wurde vom Repräsentantenhaus verabschiedet und an den Justizausschuss des Senats verwiesen. HR 5645 – Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2018 Was ist das? Gemäß Gesetz 360: Der SMARTER Act würde die Unterschiede zwischen den Ansätzen des DOJ und der FTC in Bezug auf Fusionsanfechtungen beseitigen, indem er die FTC verpflichtet, angefochtene Fusionsanfechtungen vor einem Bundesgericht zu verhandeln, anstatt durch ihr administratives Überprüfungsverfahren. Befürworter des SMARTER Act argumentieren, dass er Unternehmen mehr Sicherheit bietet, indem er die unterschiedlichen Prozesse der FTC und des DOJ in Einklang bringt. Gegner betrachten den Vorschlag als Angriff auf die Fähigkeit der FTC, ihre Aufgaben ordnungsgemäß zu erfüllen, und schwächen die FTC unnötig, indem sie dieses Durchsetzungsinstrument aus ihren Befugnissen entfernen. Wie hat Lamb abgestimmt? Lamb stimmte gegen die Maßnahme und schloss sich allen bis auf vier Demokraten an. Wie hat Rothfus abgestimmt? Rothfus stimmte für die Maßnahme, was einer Parteilinienabstimmung gleichkam. Wo steht es? HR 5645 passierte das Haus und wurde an den Justizausschuss des Senats verwiesen. H.R. 2: Landwirtschafts- und Ernährungsgesetz von 2018 (Farm Bill) Was ist das? Die Farm Bill ist eine mehrjährige Ausgabenrechnung, die eine Reihe von Agrar- und Ernährungsprogrammen abdeckt – alles von landwirtschaftlichen Rohstoffpreisen und Einkommensstützungen, landwirtschaftlicher Erhaltung, landwirtschaftlichen Krediten, Handel, Forschung, ländlicher Entwicklung, Bioenergie, ausländischer Nahrungsmittelhilfe und einheimischer Ernährung Unterstützung, berichtet der Congressional Research Service. Der diesjährige Vorschlag war wegen der vorgeschlagenen Kürzungen des Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) und der vorgeschlagenen Hinzufügung von Arbeitsanforderungen für SNAP-Empfänger umstritten. Wie hat Lamb abgestimmt? Lamb stimmte mit allen 183 Demokraten, die am 18. Mai ihre Stimme abgegeben hatten, gegen die Maßnahme. Wie hat Rothfus abgestimmt? Rothfus stimmte ebenfalls mit Nein und schloss sich nur 30 republikanischen Gesetzgebern an, die sich gegen die Maßnahme aussprachen. „Während dieses Gesetz notwendige Reformen der Landwirtschafts- und Ernährungsprogramme einleitete, sind in einer Ära einer Staatsverschuldung von fast 21 Billionen US-Dollar weitere Reformen erforderlich“, sagte Rothfus in einer Erklärung. „Der Kongress muss sehr vorsichtig sein, wie er hart verdiente Steuergelder ausgibt. Dieser Gesetzentwurf war eine verpasste Gelegenheit für ernsthafte Reformen der Agrarsubventionsprogramme.“ NPR berichtet, dass von den 30 Republikanern, die gegen den Farm Bill-Vorschlag mit Nein gestimmt haben, viele Mitglieder des House Freedom Caucus sind und dass sie mit Nein gestimmt haben, nachdem sie im Austausch für ihre Unterstützung keine Zugeständnisse bei den Ausgaben und eine zukünftige Abstimmung über die Einwanderung erhalten hatten. Rothfus war bis zu seinem Rücktritt im Jahr 2016 Mitglied des House Freedom Caucus. Wo steht die Rechnung? Der Gesetzentwurf scheiterte im Haus in einem 198-213 und muss noch für weitere Verfahren angesetzt werden. HR 3053 – Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2018 Was ist das? HR 3053 ist ein Gesetzentwurf, der das Energieministerium ermächtigen soll, einen Plan wieder aufzunehmen – der unter der Obama-Regierung gestoppt wurde – zum Bau der Yucca Mountain-Anlage zur Lagerung radioaktiver Atomabfälle. Unterstützer von HR 3053 sagen, dass sich landesweit Müll in Kraftwerken häuft, weil Yucca Mountain nicht verfügbar ist. Kritiker verweisen auf Sicherheitsbedenken und „staatliches Mobbing“, um ihren Widerstand zu erklären. Wie hat Lamb abgestimmt? Lamb stimmte für die Gesetzesvorlage zur Wiederaufnahme des Programms und schloss sich 221 Republikanern und 119 Mitgliedern seiner eigenen Partei an. Wie hat Rothfus abgestimmt? Auch Rothfus stimmte für den Gesetzentwurf. Wo steht es? Verweisung an den Senatsausschuss für Umwelt und öffentliche Arbeiten. HR 3144 – Bereitstellung des Betriebs des Federal Columbia River Power Systems gemäß einem bestimmten Betriebsplan für einen bestimmten Zeitraum und für andere Zwecke. Was ist das? Der Gesetzentwurf, der von der US-Kongressabgeordneten Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Spokane, gesponsert wurde, würde die Anordnung eines Bundesrichters aufheben, der fordert, dass mehr Frühling auf Dämme entlang der Flüsse Columbia und Snake im Nordwesten übergreifen soll, um gefährdete Lachse zu schützen. Laut High Country News würde der Gesetzentwurf Managementpläne festschreiben, die nach Ansicht des Richters gegen Bundesumweltgesetze verstoßen. Wie hat Lamb abgestimmt? Lamb stimmte zusammen mit 181 von insgesamt 189 stimmberechtigten Demokraten dagegen. Wie hat Rothfus abgestimmt? Rothfus stimmte für die Maßnahme und schloss sich allen bis auf 8 republikanischen Wählern im Repräsentantenhaus an. Wo steht es? Der Gesetzentwurf wurde vom Repräsentantenhaus verabschiedet und an den Senatsausschuss für Umwelt und öffentliche Arbeiten verwiesen."

Mit anderen Worten, unsere Doktrin sehe kein Recht auf einen Präventivschlag vor, betonte Peskow und fügte hinzu, dass sich Russland das Recht auf einen Atomschlag nur dann vorbehalte, wenn es mit Atomwaffen angegriffen oder auf eine Weise angegriffen werde, die seine bloße Existenz gefährdet der Staat.

5a2459c3	Eine Maßnahme zur Begrenzung der Amtszeit von Mitgliedern der Schulbehörde von Florida hat die Unterstützung der beiden Männer gewonnen, die die republikanische Nominierung zum nächsten Gouverneur des Staates anstreben. Sie haben sich jedoch nicht zu den anderen beiden Bestimmungen geäußert, an die das Konzept gebunden ist, wenn es zur Abstimmung im November geht. Der US-Abgeordnete Ron DeSantis, ein Republikaner aus Jacksonville in seiner dritten Amtszeit, spricht nicht viel über Florida-spezifische Themen. Er nahm sich jedoch Zeit, um seine Position zur Begrenzung der Amtszeit von Schulbehörden bekannt zu machen, der vielleicht beliebtesten der drei Ideen in der Verfassungsänderung. Es fordert die Wähler auch auf, ein Programm zur Bildung von Staatsbürgerkunde in öffentlichen Schulen zu fordern und der Legislative zu erlauben, neue Bildungsmodelle zu schaffen, die außerhalb der Kontrolle der örtlichen Schulbehörden liegen. „Kein gewähltes Amt, ob auf Bundes- oder Kommunalebene, ist jemals besser dran, wenn es von Karrierepolitikern geführt wird“, schrieb DeSantis, ein dreijähriges Mitglied des Repräsentantenhauses aus Jacksonville, in einem Artikel für die Website der US-Amtsgrenzen. „Deshalb unterstütze ich achtjährige Amtszeitbeschränkungen für alle Schulvorstandsmitglieder“, fuhr DeSantis fort, der auch Gesetze zur Begrenzung der Kongresszeiten gefördert hat. „Ich bin zuversichtlich, dass dieser Vorschlag neue Energie und neue Ideen in die Schulbehörden bringen würde, die allzu oft unter der gleichen ungezähmten Obrigkeit leiden, die den Kongress lähmt.“ Landwirtschaftskommissar Adam Putnam, den meisten Berichten zufolge der Kandidat, der sich eher auf politische Details konzentriert, teilte diese Ansicht. „Wenn Amtszeitbeschränkungen gut genug für den Gouverneur und die Legislative sind, sind sie auch gut genug für die Schulbehörden“, sagte Putnam per E-Mail. Befürworter von Änderungsantrag 8, der bildungsorientierten Abstimmungsfrage der Verfassungsrevisionskommission, haben die Aufmerksamkeit auf den Teil der Amtszeitbeschränkung gerichtet. Das neue politische Komitee, das die Maßnahme diese Woche unterstützte, verwies in seiner Pressemitteilung auf den Vorschlag als „Beschränkungen der Amtszeit der Schulbehörde und andere K-12-Richtlinien“. Es ist dieser „andere“ Teil, der die Gegner am meisten beunruhigt. Sie haben sich in den sozialen Medien beschwert, dass der Abschnitt „Änderung von Abschnitt 4 von Artikel IX der Staatsverfassung, um festzulegen, welche Schulen von einer Schulbehörde betrieben, kontrolliert und beaufsichtigt werden“ eine zweite Ebene öffentlicher Schulen schaffen könnte, die ohne lokale Kontrolle betrieben werden , mit ernannten Vorständen mit Sitz in Tallahassee oder anderswo. Die Originalsprache, bevor die Verfassungsrevisionskommission sie änderte, sprach direkt von einem staatlichen Charter School Authorizer. Erst später änderte die Kommission den Wortlaut, um ihn allgemeiner zu halten.	Studie besagt, dass die späte Diagnose von Lungenkrebs die Überlebensrate beeinträchtigt	partially false
10cfd37c	"HON. STEFAN I. MYCHAJLIW ERIE COUNTY COMPTROLLER’S OFFICE DIVISION OF AUDIT & CONTROL 95 FRANKLIN STREET BUFFALO, NEW YORK 14202 January 29, 2021 Erie County Legislature 92 Franklin Street 4th Floor Buffalo, New York 14202 Dear Honorable Members: The Erie County Comptroller’s Office has completed a report on certain personnel and food expenses charged to fund 252, commonly known as CARES Act relief for municipalities. Our objectives were to: Update the amount of expenses for overtime attributed to fund 252. List Managerial Confidential recipients of overtime payments. Update the amount expended for food from fund 252. To accomplish these objectives, we reviewed expenses attributed to fund 252. This report serves as both an update to previous reports regarding overtime expensed to fund 252, as well as food expenses. A meeting scheduled prior to the August break to discuss overtime was postponed, with the intent to meet soon for the discussion. To date, this meeting has not yet been rescheduled. This updated information may be useful at such a discussion when it occurs. Further, the updated information will be useful in any discussions concerning food purchased using fund 252, especially food for employees. Background On March 25, 2020, the United States Senate passed the “Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act” (CARES) as amended. The United States House of Representatives approved the measure on the following day, and the bill was signed into law on March 27, 2020.
The CARES Act provided significant aid to local governments to combat COVID-19. Erie County received $160 million in federal funding. Erie County created a special fund to account for expenses permissibly reimbursed by CARES Act governmental funding. The fund is identified as fund 252. The money in fund 252 can be used for various purposes related to combatting COVID 19. These purposes include wages to individuals who tasks are to substantially address COVID 19, outfitting offices and other areas to reduce potential exposure to COVID-19, fortifying capacity to work remotely to avoid exposure to COVID-19, and supplies and protective gear to guard against COVID-19, to name just a few permissible uses. As stated, a permissible use of CARES Act funding is to pay employees whose efforts are substantially devoted to addressing COVID-19. As a result, some employees have been hired specifically for such tasks, while others have been authorized overtime for such tasks. The tasks needed to address COVID-19 are varied, and may be different from tasks typically undertaken by employees in their daily activities. At the time of passage, municipalities were required to spend the funds by December 31, 2020. In December, 2020, the deadline was extended so that funds that were determined to not be needed in 2020 must now be expended by December 31, 2021. At the prompting of legislature questions and commentary, our office has previously submitted reports quantifying overtime and holiday worked pay expended to MC employees, overtime and holiday worked pay expended to employees represented by bargaining units, pay for employees who did not report to work and were unable to perform work remotely, the utilization of the imprest fund for expenditures charged to fund 252, and the use of fund 252 for food purchases for individuals quarantining due to COVID-19, as well as employees who report to work. This report focuses serves as an update on overtime, including holiday worked overtime, associated with fund 252, as well as expenditures for food charged to fund 252. It synthesizes, as well as updates, information previously provided. CARES Act Guidance Regarding Expenditures Guidance provided by the United States Treasury Department regarding the CARES Act (updated January 15, 2021) in its Coronavirus Relief Fund Guidance for State, Territorial, Local, and Tribal Governments states that: The CARES Act provides that payments from the Fund may only be used to cover costs that – 1. are necessary expenditures incurred due to the public health emergency with respect to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19); 2. were not accounted for in the budget most recently approved as of March 27, 2020 (the date of enactment of the CARES Act) for the State or government; and 3. were incurred during the period that begins on March 1, 2020, and ends on December 30, 2021. The previous deadline for expending CARES Act funds was December 31, 2020; however, the deadline was extended by a year pursuant to section 1001 of Division N of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. Further, “[t]he statute also specifies that expenditures using Fund payments must be ‘necessary.’ The Department of the Treasury understands this term broadly to mean that the expenditure is reasonably necessary for its intended use in the reasonable judgment of the government officials responsible for spending Fund payments.” Overtime For the purposes of this report, overtime will refer to both overtime and holiday worked overtime charged to fund 252. As of the pay period ending January 1, 2021 and paid on January 8, 2021, 1,226 employees have charged 114,524 hours of overtime to fund 252, resulting in an expenditure of $5,898,195. Of this amount, $1,362,396 has been paid to 56 MC employees. This amounts to 23.1% of overtime payments to employees. MC employees comprise 6.5% of the county workforce. While the process for allocating overtime to union represented employees is outlined in labor contracts, MC employees are not bound to the terms of those contracts for overtime assignment purposes. The following are overtime payments in excess of $10,000 made to MC employees from fund 252: Office Title Hours Amount Health Commissioner of Health 1266 $183,414

Of the MC employees receiving more than $10,000 in overtime payments, 14 ultimately report to the County Executive and 13 ultimately report to the Sheriff. Although paid overtime for most MC employees was unusual prior to March, 2020, a recently implemented policy has increased the amount of compensatory time that MC employees may accumulate to 200 hours.
CARES Act Guidance Regarding Meals
In the only reference to food in the previously mentioned guidance, it states “Expenses of actions to facilitate compliance with COVID-19-related public health measures, such as: Expenses for food delivery to residents, including, for example, senior citizens and other vulnerable populations, to enable compliance with COVID-19 public health precautions.” It does not mention food expenses for employees. This guidance clearly permits food expenses for individuals housed in the hotel rented by the County for individuals with no other safe housing options and who are battling COVID-19. This qualification as a permissible expense is bolstered by the guidance listing among permissible expenses “expenses for quarantining individuals.”
However, it does not provide entire clarity as to the permissibility of paying for food for employees out of fund 252. Certainly, such expenditures qualify in that they were not otherwise budgeted to occur. Erie County does not typically provide food for employees who arrive for work and are present during a typical meal time. However, given legal and contractual requirements regarding break time for meals, questions may arise as to whether such expenditures are “necessary.” Further, listed examples of ineligible expenditures include “[w]orkforce bonuses other than hazard pay or overtime.” Although bonuses are typically thought of as extraordinary cash payments above and beyond salary, the definition of bonus may also include the provision of food not typically provided to employees in their compensation package. As such, WE RECOMMEND that clarification be sought from the federal government as to whether the CARES Act permits reimbursement for food expenses for employees while at work. Particular guidance should be requested regarding employees who are working their normal shift, which ordinarily includes a meal period.
New York State Guidance Regarding Meals
In order to properly reimburse for meals, proper documentation is necessary. These documents typically include an invoice, receipt or some other document which evidences what food was delivered and paid for, a statement of the purpose of the meeting, and a description (list) of the individuals in attendance.
The New York State Office of the Comptroller has opined that meal expenses are a proper charge to local governments if the local official is traveling outside of his or her regular work area on official business for an extended period of time or is prevented from taking time off for meals due to a pressing need to complete the business at hand. Clarifying this, the Comptroller opined that when the local government is faced with business of an immediate nature and meetings are essential at mealtime, meals would be a proper local government charge. However, the cost of meals while performing the usual duties of the position within the local government is generally a personal expense. Further, the Office of the New York State Comptroller has ruled that a municipality may make reasonable expenditures for refreshments which are incidental to a lawful municipal purpose. Examples of such expenditures include refreshments for senior citizens incidental to a recreation program; refreshments for the general public attending an official town function, and refreshments for volunteer firefighters at the scene of a serious fire.
Information available in the County’s SAP system, which is our data processing system, does not provide sufficient information to determine if the expenditures were appropriate charges to local government. Departments submitting invoices for payment are responsible for attaching documentation which supports the expenditure to be paid. The supporting documentation should be attached electronically in SAP, along with the corresponding invoice. For example, for many of the expenditures, there was not sufficient information to determine what was actually purchased, which individuals received the meals and why the food purchase was necessary. Further, the descriptions include entries such as “lunch for fire academy,” “dinner for 9th floor phone bank,” “food for Rath EOC – various days,” “groceries for OPS room,” and “supplies for warehouse.” These vague descriptions do not provide enough information to evaluate if there was participation in meetings that were essential at meal time or if there was a concern of an immediate nature.
Because COVID-19 has been present in the community since March, it may be difficult to determine that the reason for the meal was of an immediate nature. Further, there may not be support for the necessity of scheduling meetings during mealtimes. In fact, there are very few mentions of food being for meetings, regardless of whether they were required to occur during mealtimes. Also, it appears from the vague descriptions that many times meals could be provided for employees for performing the work that they are there to perform, i.e. – the usual duties of the position.
Further, given contractual and legal requirements, employees must be given breaks for meals. Failure to offer such breaks, especially on a continued basis, may subject the County to liability for violations of labor law or grievances. If the employees are being given their required meal breaks, they have time to consume meals brought from home, delivered to their work site or picked-up from a nearby restaurant. The fact that food is being delivered to the worksites is an indication that employees have the capability to secure food from a restaurant, if they so choose.
Given New York State guidance, as well as contractual and legal obligations, WE RECOMMEND that clarification be sought as to whether it is permissible for employees to be provided with meals at government expense.
Summary of Expenditures
A representative list of food expenditures is attached as Appendix A. The list is a compilation of food expenditures actually paid through December 31, 2020. It does not include items for which invoices were received, but not yet paid. The total amount of food expenditures using the fund 252 is $239,689. Prior reports on food listed several observations. These observations included:
Sales Tax Paid: Erie County is a sales tax exempt entity. Sales tax paid was noted on several receipts. It is understood that some restaurants do not accept tax exempt certificates. However, retailers such as BJs Wholesale do accept such certificates. Efforts should be considered to minimize sales tax paid using taxpayer dollars.
Purchases of Non-Food Items: Among the purchases reimbursed were cooking implements, including burners, pots, pans, spatulas, and cutlery. These purchases, made by the warehouse, were then followed by the purchase of food, including uncooked meat. It may be surmised that the raw meat was then cooked using the kitchen equipment. If true, this may be not be appropriate for reimbursement from CARES Act funding, and may also be in violation of New York State Comptroller guidance. If an employee has time to prepare a meal from scratch, it is hard to argue that meals were necessary due to an immediate need of the job. It is advisable to determine whether these expenditures were necessary and appropriate.
Purchases Prior to CARES Act: As stated above, CARES Act funding for municipalities can be used for eligible expenditures between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. A receipt reimbursed to Health Department – Bioterrorism was dated February 18, 2020, and another on February 22, 2020. These would seem to be outside of the parameters for CARES Act spending.
Communal Food: Many of the food items purchased for consumption were communal in nature, meaning that the food was meant to be shared by multiple people. An example of shared communal food would be a sheet pizza or sandwich platter. The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), in documenting recommendations for returning to work during the COVID-19 emergency, states that “[e]mployers and employees should not provide communal meals to employees, and should not make food available in common areas where employees may congregate.” As such, communal food should be discouraged. Notably, a large amount of food purchased does appear to be individually packaged meals.
Possible Duplicate Payment – Wellington Pub: On the entire list of entries, there were entries recorded depicting credits or refunds for overpayments made in error. This is not an uncommon practice during a reconciliation process. It was observed that a payment was made to Wellington Pub for 55 box lunches delivered to the SH Hotel on May 3, 2020, with a check number of 5716 (reference number 05032020-0001). It was also observed that a payment was made to Wellington Pub for 55 box lunches delivered to the SH Hotel on May 3, 2020, with a check number of 5716 (reference number 2020VF-119). A corresponding credit was not noted. It may be advisable to confirm that payments were made properly.
Duplicate Payment - ECC: It was observed that a payment was made to ECC Food Service for 72 Swedish meatball dinners picked up on May 13, 2020 (reference number 400-4847). It was also observed that a payment was made to ECC Food Service for 72 Swedish meatball dinners picked up on May 13, 2020 (reference number 400-7847). The two pick-ups would represent roughly double the amount of dinners picked-up from ECC Food Service on days around that time. Further, typically only one pick-up occurred daily from ECC Food Service. A corresponding credit was not noted. It may be advisable to confirm that payments were made properly.
Delivery expenses: The majority of food purchased was delivered, with delivery included in the final cost. Some food was picked-up. The cost of the food picked-up does not include the cost of labor or other resources used to retrieve the food. Although not known, it is possible that some individuals received overtime for the time spent picking-up food. As such, any analysis of food costs should consider the unreported costs.
Supporting Information Not Available on SAP: As stated above, there is a lack of documentation available on SAP. Some items do not have receipts attached to SAP to determine what was actually purchased. Other items provide important information, such as items purchased, cost per unit, date, location, etc., however there is no information as to the number of individuals consuming the purchased food. The lack of such readily available information could prove problematic in a future audit.
The above concerns have not yet been addressed to the Comptroller’s Office. In fact, certain concerns continue, such as the purchase of raw food products for the warehouse, most recently in November.
Conclusions
The CARES Act provides Erie County with $160 million to combat COVID-19. The funds are to be used for COVID-19 related expenses that were not otherwise anticipated in the budget. The Comptroller’s Office has previously provided updates to the Legislature concerning certain aspects of CARES Act spending, at the request of the Legislature. This report serves as an update to those previous reports.
As of the pay period ending January 1, 2021 and paid on January 8, 2021, 1,226 employees have charged 114,524 hours of overtime to fund 252, resulting in an expenditure of $5,898,195. Of this amount, $1,362,396 has been paid to 56 MC employees. The highest recipient of overtime received $183,414. This amount, compared to base the pay of all Erie County employees, would put that employee in the top five of over 4,700 employees. That top five list would also include that employee’s base salary of $202,312. A previous report to the legislature noted the comparatively low use of overtime for MC employees across New York State, when compared to Erie County. Most counties, including Erie County’s typical comparator counties, did not pay overtime to MC employees at all.
As of December 31, 2020, fund 252 expenditures for food total $239,689. This amount includes a high percentage spent on food for employees. Further, observations were made questioning the propriety of the spending.
As such, WE RECOMMEND that the propriety of using CARES Act funds to supply employee meals be examined, with particular attention given to the CARES Act, New York State Comptroller guidance, labor law and contractual obligations. Further, WE RECOMMEND that the observations made in Comm. 16D-1 (2020) be reviewed and any necessary corrections be made. In addition, WE RECOMMEND that steps be taken to reduce the usage of tax dollars for the payment of sales tax. WE RECOMMEND that overtime policies be revisited to make sure that payments were consistent with policies that existed at the time of payment. WE RECOMMEND that policies and safeguards be examined to determine how better to protect taxpayer money.

96b47cba	Die Pressesprecherin des Weißen Hauses, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, lenkte am Montag wiederholt die Fragen der Reporter zur Waffenkontrolle ab und sagte: „Es wird sicherlich eine Zeit geben, in der diese politische Diskussion stattfinden kann, aber das ist nicht der Ort, an dem wir uns derzeit befinden.“ Während desselben Medienbriefings wies Sanders jedoch auf die genaue „politische Diskussion“ ein, an der sie sagte, das Weiße Haus würde sich an „einem Tag der Trauer“ nicht beteiligen. „Ich denke, eines der Dinge, die wir nicht tun wollen, ist zu versuchen, Gesetze zu schaffen, die nicht schaffen – oder verhindern, dass solche Dinge passieren“, sagte Sanders. „Ich denke, wenn Sie nach Chicago schauen, wo Sie letztes Jahr über 4.000 Opfer von Verbrechen im Zusammenhang mit Waffen hatten, haben sie die strengsten Waffengesetze des Landes. Da hat das sicher nicht geholfen. Also, ich denke, wir müssen, wenn diese Zeit für diese Gespräche kommt, dann müssen wir uns Dinge ansehen, die tatsächlich eine echte Auswirkung haben können.“ Das ist das Weiße Haus, das nicht über Waffenkontrolle spricht. So haben die frustrierten Demokraten auf Las Vegas reagiert Wie Faktenprüfer immer wieder betont haben, ist die Behauptung, Chicago habe „die strengsten Waffengesetze des Landes“ – eine, die Trump selbst im vergangenen Herbst in einer Präsidentschaftsdebatte verwendet hat – überholt und war es nicht Dies gilt seit 2013. Es stimmt jedoch, dass die Waffenkontrollvorschriften der Stadt nach wie vor zu den strengsten der Nation gehören, und doch gab es in Chicago im vergangenen Jahr 4.368 Opfer von Schießereien, und in diesem Jahr waren es 2.877. Später reagierte Sanders auf Hillary Clintons Vorschlag, dass ein Gesetzentwurf des Repräsentantenhauses, der die Beschränkungen für Schalldämpfer lockern würde, Angriffe wie den von Stephen Paddock in Las Vegas noch tödlicher machen könnte, indem er einen akustischen Hinweis dämpft, der potenzielle Ziele warnt. „Ich habe nicht mit dem Präsidenten über dieses spezielle Thema gesprochen, aber ich glaube nicht, dass das etwas geändert hätte“, sagte Sanders. (Ein Experte, den Philip Bump von der Washington Post konsultierte, deutet an, dass Sanders in diesem Punkt wahrscheinlich Recht hat.) „Auch hier denke ich, bevor wir anfangen, über die Verhinderungen dessen zu sprechen, was letzte Nacht passiert ist, müssen wir mehr Fakten wissen“, fuhr Sanders fort. „Und im Moment sind wir einfach nicht an diesem Punkt. Es ist sehr einfach für Frau Clinton zu kritisieren und sich zu outen, aber ich denke, wir müssen uns daran erinnern, dass die einzige Person mit Blut an den Händen die des Schützen ist.“ Während des Briefings bemerkte Hallie Jackson von NBC: „Nach der Schießerei in Orlando war der Präsident an diesem Tag auf Twitter unterwegs und sprach über Politik; Er sprach von seinem Reiseverbot.“ Jackson hatte recht: Aufgrund des von Trump geschaffenen Präzedenzfalls fällt es dem Weißen Haus schwer zu sagen, dass unmittelbar nach einer Massenerschießung nicht die Zeit ist, über Politik zu sprechen. Offenbar fällt es Trumps Team auch schwer, sich dem Gespräch über Politik zu widersetzen, selbst wenn es darauf besteht, dass „heute ein Tag ist, um die Überlebenden zu trösten und um die zu trauern, die wir verloren haben“. Es ist an sich nichts falsch daran, dass Sanders die Positionen des Präsidenten zur Waffenkontrolle darlegt. Demokraten erklären sicherlich ihre eigenen. Aber die Vorstellung, dass das Weiße Haus sich weigert, das Thema so kurz nach der Tragödie zu diskutieren, entspricht nicht der Realität.

53eabb9b	Handelsabkommen und Druck auf Indiens „Apotheke der Entwicklungsländer“ stellen große Bedrohungen für den Zugang dar Durban, 21. Juli 2016 – Die internationale medizinische humanitäre Organisation Médecins Sans Frontières hat heute die 18 Reductions, auf der Internationalen AIDS-Konferenz in Durban, Südafrika. Der Bericht stellt fest, dass die Preise für ältere HIV-Medikamente weiter sinken, während die Preise für neuere Medikamente weitgehend außer Reichweite bleiben. Dies liegt zum großen Teil daran, dass Pharmakonzerne Monopole unterhalten, die den preissenkenden Generika-Wettbewerb blockieren. Heute liegt der niedrigste verfügbare Preis für eine qualitätsgesicherte, von der Weltgesundheitsorganisation empfohlene Erstlinienkombination mit einer Tablette pro Tag bei 100 US-Dollar pro Person und Jahr (Tenofovir/Emtricitabin/Efavirenz). Dies ist ein Rückgang um 26 %, seit Ärzte ohne Grenzen 2014 mit 136 US-Dollar zuletzt den niedrigsten Preis für eine Erstlinienbehandlung verzeichnete. Für eine von der WHO empfohlene Zweitlinienbehandlung beträgt der niedrigste verfügbare Preis jetzt 286 US-Dollar pro Person und Jahr (Zidovudin/Lamivudin + Atazanavir/Ritonavir) – ein Rückgang um 11 % gegenüber 322 US-Dollar vor zwei Jahren. Diese Preise fallen aufgrund des robusten Wettbewerbs zwischen Generika-Herstellern in wichtigen Produktionsländern, vor allem in Indien, weiter. Aber der Preis für neuere Medikamente – die für Menschen benötigt werden, denen andere HIV-Behandlungsmöglichkeiten ausgegangen sind – bleibt hoch, vor allem wegen der Patentmonopole der Pharmakonzerne. Der niedrigste Preis für Salvage-Behandlungen beträgt heute 1.859 USD pro Person und Jahr (Raltegravir + Darunavir/Ritonavir + Etravirin). Dies ist mehr als das 18-fache des Preises einer Erstlinientherapie und mehr als das Sechsfache des Preises der derzeit günstigsten Zweitlinien-Kombination. Der Preis für diese Kombination ist nur um sieben Prozent gesunken, von 2.006 US-Dollar pro Jahr im Jahr 2014. Dies sind die niedrigsten Preise weltweit, aber viele Länder, insbesondere Länder mit mittlerem Einkommen, zahlen viel höhere Preise für diese Medikamente, weil pharmazeutische Patente blockiert sind sie von der Verwendung von Generika. „Der Preis für neuere Medikamente – die für Menschen benötigt werden, denen andere HIV-Behandlungsmöglichkeiten ausgegangen sind – bleibt hoch, hauptsächlich aufgrund der Patentmonopole, die von Pharmakonzernen gehalten werden.“ „Wir müssen uns die neueren Kombinationen von HIV-Medikamenten leisten können, die die Menschen im Laufe der Zeit benötigen werden, sonst haben sie keine anderen Möglichkeiten“, sagte Dr. Vivian Cox, medizinische Referentin für das Esshowe-Projekt von Ärzte ohne Grenzen in Südafrika. „Wir müssen es sein jetzt darüber zu schreien, um sicherzustellen, dass wir nicht in eine weitere Behandlungskrise geraten, wie wir sie vor über einem Jahrzehnt erlebt haben, als lebensrettende Medikamente für Millionen von Menschen, die sie brauchten, einfach preislich unerschwinglich waren.“ Während heute die Zahl der Menschen, die eine Salvage-Therapie benötigen, in Entwicklungsländern immer noch relativ gering ist, trägt der zunehmende Einsatz der Goldstandard-Überwachung der Viruslastbehandlung dazu bei, mehr Menschen zu identifizieren, die bei ihrer Erst- oder Zweitlinienbehandlung versagen und dies müssen auf ein anderes Arzneimittelset umgestellt. Bereits in den HIV-Programmen von Ärzte ohne Grenzen hat sich die Zahl der Menschen, die zur Zweitlinientherapie übergegangen sind, seit 2013 fast verdoppelt. der HIV-Medikamente, die Ärzte ohne Grenzen in ihren Behandlungsprogrammen verwendet, sind Generika aus Indien. Das indische Patentgesetz legt eine hohe Messlatte für das fest, was ein Patent verdient. Dies ermöglicht einen robusten Wettbewerb zwischen Generikaherstellern, der die Preise für HIV-Erstbehandlungen um 99 % gesenkt hat – von 10.000 USD pro Person und Jahr im Jahr 2000 auf 100 USD heute. Aber Indien sieht sich einem immensen Druck ausgesetzt, seine gesundheitsfördernde Patentpolitik zurückzunehmen – die das Leben der Menschen über die Unternehmensgewinne stellt – insbesondere von den Vereinigten Staaten, die von ihrer Lobby der Pharmakonzerne unterstützt werden. Andere Länder, wie die EU, zusammen mit Japan und Südkorea, bereiten Handelsabkommen mit Indien vor oder verfolgen diese aktiv, die die Produktion erschwinglicher Medikamente des Landes in Zukunft einschränken würden. Sollte Indien gezwungen sein, seine Politik für diese Handelsabkommen zu ändern, könnte dies eine ernsthafte Bedrohung für die erschwingliche Arzneimittelproduktion in Indien darstellen. „Indien steht unter massivem Druck, den Zugang zu erschwinglichen Medikamenten zu stoppen, die für Millionen von Menschen nicht nur in Indien, sondern in den Entwicklungsländern eine Lebensader darstellen“, sagte Leena Menghaney, Leiterin der Access-Kampagne von Ärzte ohne Grenzen in Südasien. „Wenn Indien sich nicht stark gegen die Pharmakonzerne und Regierungen stellt, die auf eine Änderung des Patentrechts und der Patentpolitik des Landes drängen, werden Menschen auf der ganzen Welt in Zukunft mit einer Krise beim Zugang zu Medikamenten konfrontiert sein. Laden Sie hier den vollständigen Bericht herunter. Im Juni 2015 startete Ärzte ohne Grenzen eine Kampagne, in der Indien aufgefordert wurde, seinen Status als „Apotheke der Entwicklungsländer“ zu wahren. Millionen Menschen in Entwicklungsländern könnten betroffen sein, wenn Indien dem Druck nachgibt.

Die Absicht der Vereinigten Staaten, Sanktionen gegen Russland wegen der Skirpals-Affäre zu verhängen, stelle eine Bedrohung für die Integrität des Chemiewaffenübereinkommens CWC dar und schade der Autorität der Organisation für das Verbot chemischer Waffen, sagte das russische Außenministerium in einer Erklärung, die am veröffentlicht wurde Montag.

Die Vereinigten Staaten haben mehr als einmal ihre verächtliche Haltung gegenüber dem System des Völkerrechts und den Wunsch bewiesen, die bestehenden multilateralen Rüstungskontrollmechanismen zu nutzen, um ihre eigene politische Agenda voranzutreiben. Heuchlerische Haltung Das Außenministerium erinnerte daran, dass die Vereinigten Staaten versuchen, Russland wegen des Einsatzes chemischer Waffen im sogenannten Skripal-Fall anzuklagen. Beweise dafür konnte bisher niemand vorlegen. Trotz unserer wiederholten Bitten hat sich die britische Seite geweigert, bei der Untersuchung des Vorfalls vom 4. März in Salisbury zusammenzuarbeiten, sagte das Außenministerium. Das US-Außenministerium stellt in seiner Mitteilung an Russland die vollständige Beseitigung des russischen Chemiewaffenarsenals in Frage. Man ignoriere lieber, dass das im vergangenen Jahr abgeschlossene russische Programm zur Beseitigung chemischer Waffen unter strenger internationaler Kontrolle und strikter Einhaltung des CWÜ durchgeführt worden sei, teilte das Außenministerium mit. Wir betrachten die gegen Russland vorgebrachten grundlosen Anschuldigungen der Mittäterschaft im Fall von Salisbury als einen weiteren Versuch, den Eindruck zu erwecken, dass unser Land eine unverantwortliche Haltung gegenüber der Einhaltung internationaler Verpflichtungen einnimmt, heißt es in der Erklärung. Dieser Ansatz erscheint besonders heuchlerisch in einer Situation, in der die Vereinigten Staaten es nicht eilig haben, ihr eigenes Arsenal an chemischen Waffen zu beseitigen, und der einzige CWÜ-Unterzeichner bleiben, der beträchtliche Mengen chemischer Kampfstoffe besitzt.

905519d3	Laut Zahlen von NHS Digital kosten Diabetes-Rezepte den NHS in England mehr als 1 Milliarde Pfund pro Jahr. Die Gesamtkosten der Rezepte sind in den letzten 10 Jahren erheblich gestiegen – um mehr als 422 Millionen £. Fast eins von 20 Rezepten, die von Hausärzten ausgestellt werden, sind jetzt für die Behandlung von Diabetes bestimmt. Die größten Zuwächse sind bei der Behandlung von Typ-2-Diabetes zu verzeichnen, von dem etwa 90 % der Diabetespatienten betroffen sind. Robin Hewings, Leiter der Politikabteilung der Wohltätigkeitsorganisation Diabetes UK, sagte, die Zahlen spiegeln einen dramatischen Anstieg der Diabetes-Inzidenz wider. Die Zahl der an Diabetes erkrankten Menschen hat sich in den letzten 20 Jahren verdoppelt und ist neben schweren Komplikationen wie Erblindung, Amputation oder Schlaganfall für 26.000 frühe Todesfälle pro Jahr verantwortlich. Diese Daten zeigen, dass die Verschreibung von Diabetes £ 1 Milliarde kostet, aber es wird geschätzt, dass die Gesamtkosten für den NHS über £ 10 Milliarden pro Jahr liegen, so dass der wahre Preis, den wir für Diabetes zahlen müssen, nicht die Medikamente sind, sondern die verheerenden und teuren Komplikationen. Herr Hewings wies darauf hin, dass die Arzneimittelkosten in diesem Zeitraum nicht wesentlich gestiegen sind und dass der Anstieg der Verschreibungskosten größtenteils auf die Zunahme der Prävalenz von Typ-2-Diabetes zurückzuführen ist. Diabetes-Anzeichen „Jahre früher nachweisbar“ „Postleitzahl-Lotterie“ für Diabetes-Monitore Diabetes-Info-Rezeptplan Präsentatorische graue Linie Der Anstieg von Diabetes Mittlerweile gibt es in England über drei Millionen Menschen mit einer Diabetes-Diagnose. Die Zahl hat sich in den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten verdoppelt und es gibt fast 100.000 Diagnosen pro Jahr. 92 % der erfassten Diabetesdiagnosen beziehen sich auf Typ-2-Diabetes. Typ-2-Diabetes ist im Gegensatz zu Typ-1 eng mit Lebensstilfaktoren verbunden und kann durch eine Änderung des Lebensstils verhindert werden. Fast sieben von zehn Männern sind übergewichtig oder fettleibig (66,8 %) und fast sechs von 10 Frauen sind übergewichtig oder fettleibig (57,8 %) in England. Quelle: NHS England Präsentation graue Linie Typ-2-Diabetes wird dadurch verursacht, dass der Körper nicht genug Insulin produziert oder dass die Körperzellen nicht auf das vorhandene Insulin reagieren, was zu hohem Blutzucker führt. Es kann durch Diät oder durch Antidiabetika oder Insulin oder beides kontrolliert werden. Typ 2 wird durch eine Vielzahl von Faktoren verursacht, von denen einige außerhalb der Kontrolle der Menschen liegen, aber mehr als 80 Prozent werden durch Fettleibigkeit oder Übergewicht verursacht. Bei übergewichtigen und fettleibigen Menschen kann Typ-2-Diabetes durch Gewichtsabnahme verhindert und rückgängig gemacht werden. Die Zahlen von NHS England beinhalten auch die Kosten für Geräte, die von Diabetikern zur Überwachung ihres Zustands verwendet werden. In den Jahren 2017-18 wurden fast 477 Millionen Pfund für Antidiabetika ausgegeben. Im selben Jahr wurden rund 350 Millionen Pfund für Insulin und 181 Millionen Pfund für Diagnose- und Überwachungsgeräte ausgegeben. Professor Jonathan Valabhji, nationaler klinischer Direktor für Diabetes und Fettleibigkeit beim NHS England, sagte: Dank besserer Diagnose und Behandlung versorgt der NHS mehr Menschen mit Diabetes als je zuvor, und diese neuen Daten unterstreichen die dringende Notwendigkeit, Typ-2-Diabetes zu verhindern überhaupt nicht entwickeln. Das Diabetes-Präventionsprogramm des NHS hat inzwischen über eine Viertelmillion Menschen mit einem hohen Risiko für Typ-2-Diabetes erreicht.

da910b12	Als Vater habe ich den Herzschmerz des Drogenmissbrauchs gespürt. Meine Tochter Noelle litt unter Sucht, und wie viele Eltern, die in ähnlichen Situationen standen, hatten ihre Mutter und ich Mühe, ihr zu helfen. Ich habe so viele Freunde und kenne so viele Familien, die sich dieser schrecklichen Herausforderung gestellt haben. Sucht überwindet alle Barrieren, alle Grenzen, alle Rassen und alle Einkommen. Es schafft echte Not und Herzschmerz in Familien. Und es stellt erhebliche Anforderungen an die Regierung auf allen Ebenen. Ich hätte nie erwartet, meine geliebte Tochter im Gefängnis zu sehen. Es war nicht einfach, und es wurde sehr öffentlich, als ich Gouverneur von Florida war, was die Dinge für Noelle noch schwieriger machte. Sie ging durch die Hölle, ihre Mutter auch und ich auch. Es ist sehr schwächend, wenn Sie einen geliebten Menschen haben, der Probleme hat, und Sie können es nicht kontrollieren. Sie müssen sie lieben, aber Sie müssen auch klarstellen, dass Sie das Verhalten, das sie in Schwierigkeiten bringt, nicht ermöglichen können. Noelle zeigte viel Mut und absolvierte das Drogengericht. Drogengerichte verwenden ein restauratives Lösungsmodell, das eine multidisziplinäre Koordination umfasst, einschließlich der Justiz, der Staatsanwaltschaft, Spezialisten für psychische Gesundheit, Sozialdienste und Behandlungsexperten. Ich war der stolze Vater, der gesehen hat, wie Noelle das beendet hat. Sie ist jetzt drogenfrei. Als Gouverneur von Florida habe ich verschiedene Strategien angewandt, um den Heroinkonsum unter Jugendlichen in Florida um etwa 50 Prozent zu reduzieren. Als Präsident werde ich dieses Land dazu bringen, den Drogenmissbrauch drastisch zu reduzieren. Die massive Heroin- und illegale Drogenepidemie des Landes wird durch den starken Anstieg des Missbrauchs von verschreibungspflichtigen Schmerzmitteln verschlimmert und angeheizt. Das Problem wird durch die enorme Zunahme der Verfügbarkeit von billigem, hochwirksamem Heroin verschärft, was hauptsächlich darauf zurückzuführen ist, dass mexikanische Drogenkartelle in die Produktion, den Handel und den Vertrieb von Heroin und anderen illegalen Drogen verwickelt sind. Einige bezeichnen die Drogenmissbrauchsepidemie nur als ein Problem der Strafjustiz, und andere versuchen, es nur zu einem Problem der Gesundheitsfürsorge zu machen. Beide Ansätze vereinfachen diese komplexe und herzzerreißende Herausforderung. Es ist zwingend erforderlich, sowohl die Nachfrage als auch das Angebot zu reduzieren, wenn Behandlungs- und Genesungsprogramme funktionieren sollen. Um diesen Kampf im ganzen Land zu gewinnen, brauchen wir meines Erachtens eine vielschichtige Strategie, die: Drogenmissbrauch und Sucht vorbeugt, bevor sie beginnt: Bemühungen zur Prävention von Drogenmissbrauch und Sucht müssen in der Kindheit beginnen. Das beginnt mit engagierten Eltern, starken Gemeinschaften und lokaler Bildung. Der Privatsektor muss sich ebenfalls verpflichten, sich diesem Kampf anzuschließen, um Erfolge zu erzielen, einschließlich Koalitionen, die von lokalen Gemeinschaften vorangetrieben werden und Fachleute aus den Bereichen Gesundheit, lokale Strafverfolgung und Sozialdienste einbeziehen. Als ich Gouverneur von Florida war, übernahm meine Frau Columba eine sehr aktive Rolle bei den Präventionsbemühungen mit Kindern; Behandlungseinrichtungen, die sich auf Frauen mit Kindern und kämpfenden Kindern konzentrieren; und Koordinierung eines Ressourcennetzwerks für lokale Gemeinschaften auf Bezirksebene. Stärkung der Strafjustiz: Ich werde sicherstellen, dass die Strafverfolgungsbehörden des Bundes über die erforderlichen Ressourcen verfügen, Richtlinien unterstützen, die Pillenmühlen von evidenzbasierten Schmerzkliniken unterscheiden, und den Zugang zu Drogengerichten erweitern, einer Alternative zum traditionellen Strafsystem, damit gewaltfreie Drogenstraftäter erhalten Behandlung und Genesungsunterstützung. Ich werde auch klügere Strafgesetze für Drogenstraftäter erlassen, mit harten Konsequenzen für Drogenbarone, Kartelle und gewalttätige Drogenhändler, und gleichzeitig sicherstellen, dass gewaltfreie Drogenstraftäter die notwendige Behandlung erhalten und mit reduzierten Zwangsstrafen schneller in ihre Gemeinschaften zurückkehren. Sichert die Grenze, um den Fluss illegaler Drogen zu stoppen: Ich werde die Grenze sichern, um den Fluss illegaler Drogen in die Vereinigten Staaten zu stoppen, da das meiste Heroin aus Mexiko in die Vereinigten Staaten gelangt. Ich werde mit Partnerländern wie Mexiko, Kolumbien und Afghanistan zusammenarbeiten, um die Quelle illegaler Drogen zu bekämpfen und den illegalen Drogenhandel zu unterbinden. Verbessert die Behandlung von Drogenmissbrauch und Genesungsprogramme: Ich werde die Überwachungsprogramme für verschreibungspflichtige Medikamente (PDMPs) stärken und koordinieren, um elektronische Verschreibungs- und Abgabedaten zu überwachen und zu analysieren. Ich werde Innovationen für eine Reihe von Behandlungs- und Genesungsinstrumenten fördern, die den individuellen medizinischen Bedürfnissen und Überzeugungen des Einzelnen entsprechen. Und ich werde eine strenge Bewertung bestehender Präventions-, Behandlungs- und Genesungsprogramme durchführen, um sicherzustellen, dass die Finanzierung evidenzbasierte Programme unterstützt, die die Ergebnisse konsequent überwachen. Drogenmissbrauch und -sucht schaden Amerikanern aus allen Lebensbereichen. Es ist ein komplexes Problem, das eine multidisziplinäre und facettenreiche Lösung erfordert. Es wird eine echte Führung erfordern, die die Lösung des Problems zur obersten Priorität macht. Ich habe diese Epidemie erfolgreich als Gouverneur bekämpft, aber was noch wichtiger ist, ich habe sie als Vater erlebt. Wir wissen, wie wir in diesem Kampf etwas bewirken können, und mit der richtigen Führung und den richtigen Lösungen werden wir das tun.	Den Herzschmerz der Sucht ansprechen	partially false
3fb9f568	Meinung: Pandemien und Freiheit – Gleichgewicht finden Als Vertreter des Staates hatte ich einen Platz in der ersten Reihe für Missouris Reaktion auf die Coronavirus-Bedrohung. Wir haben erhebliche Vorbereitungen getroffen, um mit dem Zustrom von Patienten fertig zu werden, und unsere Gebete gesprochen, dass die soziale Distanzierung und die Anordnungen zur Unterbringung von Unterkünften die Kurve ausreichend „abflachen“ würden, um Leben zu retten und uns vor den Albtraumvorhersagen des schlimmsten Szenarios von Millionen von Toten im ganzen Land zu bewahren. Es war sehr ermutigend, täglich von unserem Gouverneur und den Beamten des öffentlichen Gesundheitswesens zu hören, dass wir enorme Ressourcen mobilisiert und Millionen von Dollar für Ausrüstung bereitgestellt haben, die unsere Gesundheitsdienstleister und Ersthelfer benötigen, um sie zu schützen, während sie sich um unsere Kranken kümmern , haben die Bürokratie abgebaut, um sicherzustellen, dass die beabsichtigten Empfänger in Rekordzeit das bekommen, was sie sollten, haben dafür gesorgt, dass unsere Lebensmittelversorgung sicher ist, und haben vernünftige Vorkehrungen getroffen, um die „Kurve“ im Vergleich zu der so flach wie ein Maulwurfshügel zu halten Berge erlebt in anderen Ländern. Glücklicherweise haben wir bisher Erfolge gesehen, da fast die Hälfte unserer Landkreise keine positiven Fälle gemeldet hat. Es ist auch erfreulich zu sehen, wie der private und der gemeinnützige Sektor das tun, was sie immer tun – so schnell wie möglich auf so viele Arten wie möglich helfen, um den Bedürftigen zu helfen, angefangen bei der Verteilung von Lebensmitteln bis hin zur Unterstützung von Unternehmen bei der Beantragung des Zugangs zu staatlichen Ressourcen ohne weitere Verzögerung. Die USA haben ihre Wirtschaft noch nie in einem solchen Ausmaß absichtlich heruntergefahren. Wir befinden uns in unbekannten Gewässern, und es war erfreulich zu sehen, wie viele Amerikaner sich selbstlos der Herausforderung gestellt haben, angefangen bei unseren Mitarbeitern im Gesundheitswesen und Ersthelfern, unseren Schulen und unseren Unternehmen, die vor sechs Monaten unvorstellbare Schwierigkeiten ertragen müssen. Auf der anderen Seite habe ich das Schlimmste gesehen, angefangen mit den Idioten in den Nachbarstaaten, die Händedesinfektionsmittel horten, um sie zu radikal erhöhten Preisen online zu verkaufen, Razzien auf Toilettenpapier, die auf einer Art Weisheit beruhen, die mir bisher entgangen ist, und dem Am ärgerlichsten sind Panikverkäufe vermeintlich intelligenter Finanzzauberer, die es schaffen, täglich Billionen von Dollar an Marktwert zur Detonation zu bringen, weil ihre Quartalszahlen nicht so gut laufen – trotz des unbestrittenen Wissens, dass „auch das vorübergehen wird“. Wenn dieser Wahnsinn anhält, werden unsere Rentenkonten weitere 10 Jahre Beiträge benötigen, bevor wir bequem aus der Belegschaft ausscheiden können. Ich habe auch mehr Zeit damit verbracht, böse Gerüchte niederzuschlagen, die eine schlimme Situation nur verschlimmern würden, und mich durch Bürokratie und Catch-22s gekämpft, die es immer noch geschafft haben, zu überleben. Eine weitere beunruhigende Entwicklung: Wir wurden mit atemloser, ununterbrochener Berichterstattung über die Zahl derjenigen, die sich mit dem Virus infiziert haben, und derer, die hier und weltweit gestorben sind, überschwemmt, die pflichtbewusst schneller aktualisiert werden als die Finanznachrichten die Aktienkurse aktualisieren. Auf der anderen Seite dieser Gleichung fehlt es schmerzlich an Kontext: Den Geschichten derer, die sich mit dem Virus infiziert und es durchlebt haben, wurde bei weitem nicht die gleiche Zeit gewidmet, was tatsächlich der überwiegenden Mehrheit der Erkrankten entspricht. Wir hatten Prominente, die vom Virus krank wurden – Tom Hanks und Boris Johnson fallen mir sofort ein. Beide haben überlebt und sind auf dem Weg der Besserung. Die Leute in den Massenmedien waren unerklärlicherweise zurückhaltend darin, Hoffnung zu verbreiten, indem sie die gute Nachricht verbreiteten, dass die USA eine bemerkenswert niedrige Sterblichkeitsrate pro Tausend bestätigter Fälle haben – was sogar noch weniger ist als angekündigt, da es wahrscheinlich Millionen unter uns gibt, die dies hatten Virus, dachte es wäre etwas anderes und kam unbeschadet durch. Ich werde nicht den Atem anhalten, dass die Massenmedien in absehbarer Zeit ihre Taktik ändern werden. Als Staatsvertreter muss ich auch vorausdenken, welche Lehren aus dieser Pandemie zu ziehen sind und wie man sie am besten sowohl auf der Ebene der Politik als auch der Mittel anwenden kann. Dies sind einige der Punkte, die ich im Moment in Erwägung ziehe. Erstens, wie können wir – wenn möglich – den physischen und wirtschaftlichen Schaden für unsere Mitarbeiter durch Viren, die mit alarmierender Regelmäßigkeit über den Globus fegen, stoppen oder stark einschränken? Da China die weltweit führende Petrischale für das Brauen von Viren zu sein scheint, die sowohl Tiere als auch Menschen töten, und Berichten zufolge den Sprung von Viren von Tieren auf Menschen durch die Aufnahme von Lebewesen wie Fledermäusen und Schuppentieren erleichtert, die über sogenannte „Wet Markets“ erhältlich sind, „Müssen wir alle Reisenden aus China dauerhaft medizinisch untersuchen, bevor wir sie aus Flugzeugen oder Schiffen aussteigen lassen, wenn wir wissen, dass dieses Virus eine zweiwöchige Sicherung hat? Wir warten jetzt in langen Schlangen an Flughäfen darauf, dass die TSA sicherstellt, dass wir nicht alle Terroristen sind. Das Coronavirus hat viel mehr Menschen getötet als Terroristen und Billionen unserer Wirtschaft eingespart, Schäden, von denen Terroristen nur träumen können. Für zusätzlichen Kontext: Jeder, der glaubt, dass China unser „Freund“ ist, hat ignoriert, dass es sich um einen totalitären Staat handelt, der durch seine kollektivistischen Zähne über die Ursprünge dieses Virus gelogen und die Möglichkeit, es vor Ort in Wuhan einzudämmen, „umgesiedelt“ hat „mindestens 1 Million Uiguren in „Umerziehungs“-Lagern, um sie von ihrem religiösen Glauben zu heilen, hat Industriespionage (und regelrechten Diebstahl von geistigem Eigentum) in einem Ausmaß betrieben, das es in der Menschheitsgeschichte noch nie zuvor gegeben hat, hat Billionen in Infrastruktur investiert, die es zu kontrollieren gilt das wirtschaftliche Schicksal Asiens, während gleichzeitig ein „Sozialkreditsystem“ eingeführt wird, das darauf abzielt, die „Konformität“ von mehr als 1 Milliarde Menschen im Inland durchzusetzen, wobei die Orwellsche Gesichtserkennungstechnologie dazu verwendet wird (oder sonst). Chruschtschow sagte dem Westen, er würde uns „begraben“, zog seinen Schuh aus und knallte ihn auf einen Tisch in der UNO, um unsere Aufmerksamkeit zu erregen; Chinas Präsident auf Lebenszeit, d. h. Diktator, Xi, hat uns die Theatralik erspart und stattdessen unser Handelsdefizitgeld eingesetzt, um uns leise, langsam und sicher zu begraben. Vor Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts basierte die amerikanische Politik, die auf John Hays Open Door Notes vor fast 125 Jahren zurückgeht, auf der Vorstellung, dass chinesische Verbraucher amerikanische Produkte in großen Mengen kaufen und uns dadurch reich machen würden. Das genaue Gegenteil ist passiert. Allein Missouri importiert jetzt Waren im Wert von mehr als 4 Milliarden US-Dollar aus China. Das entspricht 20 Prozent aller Importe in Missouri. China wiederum kauft unsere Waren im Wert von 700 Millionen Dollar, bei einem Handelsdefizit allein in Missouri von mehr als 3,2 Milliarden Dollar. Wir haben in den letzten 30 Jahren gesehen, wie töricht es ist, nach dem niedrigstmöglichen Preis zu jagen: Das Ergebnis war die Aushöhlung unseres Fertigungssektors, die den Mittleren Westen verwüstete. Wir haben Ihnen in Hannibal viele leere Gebäude zu zeigen, die Denkmäler einer kurzsichtigen Handelspolitik sind, die unser Geburtsrecht als Hersteller verschenkt hat. Auch unsere Landwirte spüren den Schmerz der Unberechenbarkeit der chinesischen Märkte. Mindestens 25 Prozent der chinesischen Schweine wurden durch den jüngsten Ausbruch der Schweinegrippe getötet – wahrscheinlich doppelt so viele, wenn man bedenkt, dass China nicht dafür bekannt ist, die Wahrheit über schlechte Nachrichten zu sagen (siehe Coronavirus-Lügen oben). Es wird Jahre dauern, diese Schweine zu ersetzen; In der Zwischenzeit werden die Sojabohnen, die sie als Rohstoffe konsumieren, in absehbarer Zeit nicht nach China geliefert. Wir können es uns buchstäblich nicht leisten, darauf zu warten, dass sie ihre Schweineherden wieder bevölkern. Nächstenliebe beginnt zu Hause. Und nachhaltiger Wohlstand auch. Zweitens muss der Schaden für unsere Wirtschaft durch Unterbrechungen der Lieferkette aus aller Welt – vor allem aus China und Japan, aber auch aus Europa – untersucht werden. Just-in-Time-Lieferung ist der Eckpfeiler der schlanken Fertigung, aber globale Störungen wie diese sind eine weitere Erinnerung daran, dass die Globalisierung schön und gut ist, wenn sie funktioniert, aber die Volkswirtschaften in Mitleidenschaft zieht, wenn sie das nicht tut. Wir leiten den Handel über Missouri und den Mittleren Westen um, wenn wir mit Überschwemmungen konfrontiert sind, aber das ist etwas ganz anderes – globale Lieferketten verlassen sich auf Produkte, die ihre Transitozeane entfernt beginnen, nicht in Nachbarstaaten. Je mehr wir in Amerika herstellen, desto weniger müssen wir uns auf Produkte aus Übersee verlassen. Und kann jemand die Gründe für die Auslagerung eines so großen Teils unserer Produktion verschreibungspflichtiger Medikamente nach China erklären? Welche Unternehmensgenies haben entschieden, dass dies in unserem besten Interesse als Nation wäre? Was passiert, wenn diese Lieferkette „unterbricht“ oder China beschließt, verschreibungspflichtige Medikamente an andere zu verkaufen? Wir sollten schlau genug sein, diese Antwort von heute an niemals herauszufinden. Drittens: Wann werden wir das Breitbandinternet als Infrastruktur behandeln, die für unser tägliches Leben genauso wichtig ist wie Straßen, Brücken und Strom? Millionen von Amerikanern wurden infolge dieser Pandemie angewiesen, von zu Hause aus zu arbeiten, und Unternehmen werden die Wirksamkeit dieses Ansatzes für ihr Endergebnis bewerten. Viele von uns gehen davon aus, dass das Notwendige zur Norm wird, da Remote-Mitarbeiter die Gemeinkosten senken. Remote-Arbeiten ist schön und gut, wenn Sie über die Internetfähigkeit verfügen, aber fast 1 Million Missourianer in ländlichen Gebieten tun dies nicht. Gleiches gilt für den auf Bundesebene angekündigten erweiterten Zugang zur Telemedizin – toll für die, die sie haben, irrelevant für die, die sie nicht haben. Stellen Sie sich vor, wie viele Grippefälle wir jährlich weniger hätten, wenn Patienten von zu Hause aus diagnostiziert und behandelt werden könnten und ihre Krankheit gar nicht erst mit der Allgemeinheit teilen müssten. Millionen von amerikanischen Schülern wird gesagt, sie sollen sich bei ihren Portalen für den Online-Unterricht anmelden, während ihre Schulen geschlossen sind, aber das ist keine Option für viel zu viele der ländlichen Schüler von Missouri – allein schätzungsweise 20.000 Highschool-Senioren in Missouri in diesem Jahr haben keine ein solcher Zugang im kritischsten Moment des Jahres: kurz vor dem Abschluss. Virtuelle Bildung ist gesetzlich und im Geiste bei uns vorhanden, findet jedoch nicht für Schüler statt, die außerhalb der Stadt leben. Schließlich haben wir mehrere Exzesse in Bezug auf die routinemäßigsten Bürgerrechte gesehen: Ein Gouverneur, der das Anpflanzen von Gemüse in Familiengärten verboten hat, und ein Bürgermeister, der bei Drive-In-Gottesdiensten Nummernschilder nimmt, wie das FBI bei einer Mafia-Boss-Beerdigung, sind zwei davon die verstörendsten Beispiele. Wenn es im Herbst eine „zweite Runde“ dieses Virus gibt und kein Impfstoff für uns alle verfügbar ist, müssen wir harte Entscheidungen darüber treffen, wie weit zu weit ist. Hoffentlich werden wir eher früher als später einen genauen Blick auf die Lehren werfen, die wir aus unserem Umgang mit unserer Reaktion auf das Coronavirus zu Beginn der „Goldenen Zwanziger“ des 21. Jahrhunderts gezogen haben. Mein Gebet ist, dass wir alle nicht nur diese Pandemie überleben, sondern auch Wege finden, der nächsten unvermeidlichen Krankheitswelle, die in den kommenden Monaten und Jahren über unsere Küsten hinwegfegen wird, den Stachel zu nehmen. Wissen ohne Anwendung ist nutzlos. Dies ist der ultimative lehrbare Moment. Wir können es uns buchstäblich nicht leisten, es zu ignorieren.

940bb348	TEILEN By Mary Burkes Unterstützung des Vorschlags, den Mindestlohn auf 10,10 Dollar pro Stunde anzuheben, könnte in ihrer Kampagne für das Amt des Gouverneurs eine gute politische Leistung bringen, aber ihr Plan wäre für Tausende von Arbeitern in Wisconsin wirtschaftlich verheerend. Die Anhebung des Mindestlohns ist ein Lose-Lose-Vorschlag, da dies zu erheblichen Arbeitsplatzverlusten in Wisconsin führen, die wirtschaftlichen Möglichkeiten für jüngere und weniger qualifizierte Arbeitnehmer verringern, die Verbraucherpreise erhöhen und die Armut nicht nennenswert verringern oder den arbeitenden Armen helfen wird. Eine aktuelle Analyse des Employment Policies Institute (EPI) ergab, dass eine Erhöhung des Mindestlohns auf 10,10 Dollar pro Stunde bis zu 27.937 Arbeitsplätze in Wisconsin vernichten würde. Diese Schätzung stimmt mit einer Hochrechnung des Congressional Budget Office überein, die landesweit 500.000 verlorene Arbeitsplätze prognostizierte, wenn der föderale Mindestlohn auf 10,10 Dollar erhöht würde. Wie würde eine Anhebung des Mindestlohns also zu Arbeitsplatzverlusten führen? Die Antwort ist ganz einfach. Die Anhebung des Mindestlohns wird die Arbeitskosten für die Arbeitgeber erhöhen. Die Arbeitgeber wiederum werden darauf reagieren, indem sie ihre Belegschaft abbauen, weniger Arbeitnehmer einstellen und die Arbeitszeit bestehender Arbeitnehmer reduzieren. Das führt zu Arbeitsplatzverlusten und weniger wirtschaftlichen Möglichkeiten für Arbeitnehmer. WMC hat kürzlich eine landesweite Umfrage in Auftrag gegeben, um dieses Problem zu testen, und festgestellt, dass 53 % der wahrscheinlichen Wähler zunächst eine Erhöhung des Mindestlohns auf 10,10 USD pro Stunde unterstützen. Die Wähler geben den Vorschlag jedoch schnell auf, wenn sie von den prognostizierten Arbeitsplatzverlusten erfahren. Die Unterstützung sinkt auf 39 %, wenn die Wähler wissen, dass die Anhebung des Mindestlohns Arbeitsplätze vernichtet. Um zu verstehen, wer von einer Mindestlohnerhöhung am meisten geschädigt wird, ist es wichtig zu verstehen, wer Mindestlohnempfänger sind. Die Daten zeigen, dass diejenigen, die am meisten von einer Erhöhung des Mindestlohns zu verlieren haben, jüngere und gering qualifizierte Arbeitnehmer sind. Laut dem US Bureau of Labor Statistics verdienen nur 1,1 % der Arbeitnehmer über 25 den Mindestlohn. Das liegt daran, dass typische Mindestlohnverdiener in Amerika Teenager sind, die mit ihren Eltern in Familien der Mittelklasse leben. Sie leben weder in Armut noch verdienen sie einen Lohn, der für den Unterhalt einer Familie ausreicht. Wisconsin ist keine Ausnahme. Laut der EPI-Analyse beträgt das durchschnittliche Haushaltseinkommen von Familien in Wisconsin, die von der Anhebung des Mindestlohns auf 10,10 USD pro Stunde betroffen sind, 58.812 USD. Das ist tatsächlich höher als das mittlere Haushaltseinkommen von Wisconsin von 52.627 $. Die Mehrheit der Mindestlohnempfänger sind eindeutig keine arbeitenden Armen, sondern junge Menschen, die mit wenig Erfahrung und sehr geringen Fähigkeiten in den Arbeitsmarkt eintreten. Sie sind Menschen, die dringend Einstiegsjobs brauchen, um den Prozess des Aufstiegs auf der wirtschaftlichen Leiter zu beginnen, indem sie Fähigkeiten erwerben, die zu besseren Jobs mit höheren Löhnen führen. Leider führt die Erhöhung des Mindestlohns dazu, dass die unterste Stufe der wirtschaftlichen Leiter für viele dieser Arbeitnehmer unerreichbar wird, da Einstiegspositionen gestrichen werden, die den Arbeitnehmern helfen, die Erfahrung zu sammeln, die sie benötigen, um in der Belegschaft aufzusteigen. Diejenigen, die eine Erhöhung des Mindestlohns als Mittel zur Armutsbekämpfung befürworten, stehen auf der falschen Seite der Geschichte. Die Anhebung des Mindestlohns hat sich im Hinblick auf die Armutsbekämpfung als unwirksam erwiesen. Das U.S. Census Bureau hat kürzlich einen Bericht veröffentlicht, dem zufolge 59,7 % der Menschen im erwerbsfähigen Alter in Armut nicht arbeiten. Es ist schwer vorstellbar, wie die Erhöhung des Mindestlohns Menschen aus der Armut befreien kann, wenn etwa 60 % der Armen gar nicht erst arbeiten. Die empirischen Beweise deuten auch darauf hin, dass die Anhebung des Mindestlohns einfach keine Auswirkungen auf die Armutsniveaus hat. Zwischen 2003 und 2007 haben insgesamt 28 Bundesländer ihren Mindestlohn über das Niveau des Bundesmindestlohns hinaus angehoben. Eine 2010 von Joseph Sabia und Richard Burkhauser durchgeführte Studie, die sich auf Mindestlohn und Armut konzentrierte, fand keine Beweise dafür, dass der Mindestlohn die Armutsquote in einem dieser 28 Staaten senkte. Die Anhebung des Mindestlohns ist eine schlecht durchdachte Wirtschaftspolitik, die Wisconsin Tausende von Arbeitsplätzen kosten würde. Es vernachlässigt den Fokus auf den kleinen Teil der Belegschaft (2,5 %), der den Mindestlohn verdient, und erschwert gleichzeitig den Aufstieg von Berufseinsteigern. Politiker sollten sich stattdessen darauf konzentrieren, wie wir das Geschäftsklima in unserem Staat verbessern können, um hochbezahlte Arbeitsplätze wie die in unserem verarbeitenden Gewerbe anzuziehen und zu halten. Scott Manley ist Vizepräsident für Regierungsbeziehungen bei Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce.	Die neueste Coronavirus-Bedrohung trifft wirklich unter die Gürtellinie. Eine neue Studie behauptet, dass das Coronavirus Sie nicht nur Ihres Geschmacks und Geruchs berauben kann – es kann Männer unfruchtbar machen und sexuell übertragen werden. Die Studie, die letzten Monat in JAMA veröffentlicht wurde, einer monatlichen Open-Access-Medizinzeitschrift, die von der American Medical Association herausgegeben wird, fand das Vorhandensein von COVID-19 in 15 % der gesammelten Samenproben. Der Forscher Dr. John Aitken verglich es mit dem Zika-Virus. „Es sollte betont werden, dass Spermien eine nachweisbare Fähigkeit haben, Virusinfektionen vom männlichen auf den weiblichen Fortpflanzungstrakt zu übertragen, wie es zum Beispiel während der sexuellen Übertragung von Zika geschieht“, sagte er dem örtlichen San Antonio Fox 8. Das Zika-Virus ist hauptsächlich eine Mücke -borne virus, das auch sexuell übertragen werden kann. Die Studie ergab auch, dass COVID-19 in menschlichen Spermien „zu einer Ansammlung von Angiotensin II führt, einem Hormon, das die Nierenfunktion und den Blutdruck reguliert. Erhöhte Spiegel dieses Hormons verursachen eine Immunantwort gegen die eindringenden COVID-19-Viruspartikel, die die Verfügbarkeit von reaktiven Sauerstoffspezies erhöht, die den Zelltod verursachen … Eine längere Exposition gegenüber erhöhten Angiotenstin-II-Spiegeln kann zum Zelltod in Spermien führen.“ Die Studie stellt fest, dass dies „letztendlich zu einem Verlust der männlichen Fruchtbarkeit führen könnte“.	partially false
e5dc9784	Die Sonne tritt derzeit in das solare Minimum ein – ein Zeitraum von etwa 11 Jahren, in dem es weniger Aktivität auf unserem Wirtsstern gibt. Experten, die die Sonne analysiert haben, glauben jedoch, dass es Hinweise darauf gibt, dass sie bis 2055 bestehen könnte. Die Sonne folgt 11-Jahres-Zyklen, in denen sie ein Sonnenmaximum und dann ein Sonnenminimum erreicht. Sind wir in der Hitzespitze? Sonnenminimum könnte großen Frost bringen Weltraumwetter: Die NASA sagt voraus, dass das nächste Sonnenmaximum an DIESEM Datum seinen Höhepunkt erreichen wird Während eines Sonnenmaximums gibt die Sonne mehr Wärme ab und ist mit Sonnenflecken übersät. Weniger Wärme in einem Sonnenminimum ist auf eine Abnahme der magnetischen Wellen zurückzuführen. Es gibt jedoch Fälle, in denen ein Sonnenminimum oder -maximum mehr als einen Zyklus andauern kann. Das berühmteste Beispiel dafür ist das Maunder-Minimum, das sieben Jahrzehnte lang eiskaltes Wetter erlebte, 1645 begann und bis 1715 andauerte und auftrat, als Sonnenflecken äußerst selten waren. Während dieser Zeit sanken die Temperaturen weltweit um 1,3 Grad Celsius, was zu kürzeren Jahreszeiten und letztendlich zu Nahrungsmittelknappheit in einer sogenannten „Mini-Eiszeit“ führte.

3dcc5d7d	Heute stellte der Kongressabgeordnete Mike Rogers HR 1813 vor, den Border Wall Funding Act von 2017. Dieser Gesetzentwurf, der von FAIR, der Federation for American Immigration Reform, unterstützt und gebilligt wird, würde eine Gebühr von 2 % auf alle Überweisungen erheben, die südlich der US-Grenze getätigt werden . Überweisungen oder Überweisungen werden häufig von illegalen Einwanderern verwendet, um Geld aus den USA in ihre Heimatländer zu überweisen. Im Jahr 2014 erhielt allein Mexiko über 24 Milliarden US-Dollar an Überweisungen aus den USA, während andere süd- und mittelamerikanische Länder über 15 % ihres BIP in Form von Überweisungen erhielten. „Präsident Trump hat sehr deutlich gemacht, dass er beabsichtigt, eine Mauer entlang unserer Südgrenze zu errichten. Als hochrangiges Mitglied des Homeland Security Committee unterstütze ich seit langem die Grenzmauer, die die Amerikaner schützen wird.“ sagte Rogers. „Um die Finanzierung der Mauer anzukurbeln, habe ich einen Gesetzentwurf eingebracht, um eine Gebühr von 2 % auf Überweisungen zu erheben, die südlich der Grenze gesendet werden. Diese Rechnung ist einfach – jeder, der sein Geld in Länder schickt, die von unseren durchlässigen Grenzen und der illegalen Einwanderung profitieren, sollte dafür verantwortlich sein, einen Teil der Mittel bereitzustellen, die für die Fertigstellung der Mauer benötigt werden. Diese Rechnung hält Geld in der amerikanischen Wirtschaft und vor allem schafft sie einen Finanzierungsstrom für den Bau der Mauer“, sagte Rogers. - ### -	Noa Pothoven: „Keine Frage von Euthanasie“, sagt Gesundheitsminister, nachdem Teenager zu Hause KORRIGIERT wurde	partially false

beea9b95	Von Truth In Sentencing Project, Pressemitteilung Hören Sie sich hier die Radiowerbung an Lake Oswego, Or (19. Juli 2012) – The Truth in Sentencing Project, eine Stiftung, die sich der Aufklärung und Information der Bürger von Oregon über die Strafjustiz, die Gefängnissysteme und die Verurteilung des Staates widmet Laws veröffentlicht heute seine erste Anzeige. Die Anzeige soll die Einwohner von Oregon wissen lassen, wer im Gefängnis ist und warum sie dort sind. • Es befasst sich mit Oregons niedriger Inhaftierungsrate, 33. von 50 Bundesstaaten. Fast 2/3 der Staaten haben höhere Inhaftierungsraten. Die Anzeige stellt auch die hohen Kosten für die Inhaftierung von Oregon pro Tag im Vergleich zu anderen Bundesstaaten wie Idaho in Frage. „Es gibt eine Menge Fehlinformationen über Oregons Strafgesetze und die Strafjustiz und die Gefängnissysteme, und das Ziel des Truth in Sentencing Project ist es, diese Missverständnisse auszuräumen“, sagte Steve Doell, Executive Director. Viele Menschen glauben beispielsweise, dass bis zu fünfzig Prozent der Gefängnisinsassen wegen Drogenbesitzes inhaftiert sind. • In einigen Bundesstaaten mag das stimmen, aber in Oregon sitzt weniger als ein halbes Prozent der 14.000 Häftlinge in Oregon wegen Drogenbesitzes im Gefängnis, und diese wurden wegen des Besitzes erheblicher Mengen illegaler Drogen wie Kokain, Ecstasy und Heroin verurteilt , Marihuana und Methamphetamin, laut der Oregon Criminal Justice Commission (CJC). Außerdem laut CJC: • Weniger als 1 von 4 aller verurteilten Straftäter wird in Oregon zu Gefängnisstrafen verurteilt. • Etwa 7 von 10 der Insassen von Oregon sind wegen Gewaltverbrechen und schwerer Sexualdelikte im Gefängnis, darunter Körperverletzung, bewaffneter Raub, Entführung, Totschlag, Kindesmissbrauch, Vergewaltigung, versuchter Mord und Mord. • Siebzehn Prozent sind wiederholte Eigentumskriminelle, Einbrüche, Identitätsdiebstahl, Betrug und Autodiebstahl. Die meisten anderen sind wiederholte Drogenkriminelle, die fast alle wegen der Herstellung und/oder des Handels mit erheblichen Mengen illegaler Drogen verurteilt wurden. Einer der Hauptgründe für den hohen Prozentsatz an Gewaltverbrechern in den Gefängnissen von Oregon liegt darin, dass die Wähler 1994 die Maßnahme 11 verabschiedeten. „Die Wähler waren der hohen Gewaltverbrechensrate in Oregon und den kurzen Strafen für Gewaltverbrecher überdrüssig, daher räumten sie ihnen eine hohe Priorität ein zu Gewaltverbrechen“, sagte Doell. „Und während die Gewaltkriminalitätsrate in Oregon von 1960 bis 1985 um fast 700 % gestiegen ist und dann bis 1995 im Grunde ein Plateau erreicht hat, ist die Gewaltkriminalitätsrate seitdem um mehr als 50 % zurückgegangen. Wir glauben, dass Maßnahme 11 einer der wichtigsten Gründe für diesen Rückgang ist“, fügte Doell hinzu.

59c7030a	Eine katholische Schule in Kentucky hat eine Gruppe ihrer Schüler verurteilt, nachdem sie in einem Video, das am Samstag viral wurde, bei der Belästigung eines Vietnamveteranen der amerikanischen Ureinwohner aufgenommen wurden. Die Schüler, von denen viele „Make America Great Again“-Mützen trugen, von der privaten, rein männlichen Covington Catholic High School in Park Hills, waren am Freitag zu einer Anti-Abtreibungs-Kundgebung in Washington, als sie um Nathan Phillips herum gefilmt wurden und sich über die Eingeborene lustig machten Amerikanischer Gesang und Trommeln. Vor allem ein Teenager steht vor Phillips und starrt ihm mit einem Lächeln ins Gesicht. Kommilitonen, viele in Hüten und Sweatshirts mit dem Slogan „MAGA“ von Präsident Donald Trump, feuerten ihn an und sangen: „Bau die Mauer, bau die Mauer“, sagte Phillips. Das Filmmaterial wurde online von Organisatoren eines Marsches indigener Völker geteilt, der ebenfalls am Freitag stattfand. Das Video löste im Internet eine Welle der Empörung aus. Die Schauspielerin und Aktivistin Alyssa Milano twitterte, dass das Filmmaterial „mich zu Tränen gerührt“ habe, während der Schauspieler Chris Evans twitterte, dass die Aktionen der Studenten „entsetzlich“ und „beschämend“ seien. In einer gemeinsamen Erklärung verurteilten die High School und die Diözese Covington die Aktionen der Schüler „gegenüber Nathan Phillips und den amerikanischen Ureinwohnern im Allgemeinen“. „Wir entschuldigen uns aufrichtig bei Mr. Phillips“, heißt es in der Erklärung. „Dieses Verhalten steht im Widerspruch zu den Lehren der Kirche über die Würde und den Respekt der menschlichen Person.“ „Die Angelegenheit wird untersucht und wir werden geeignete Maßnahmen ergreifen, bis hin zur Ausweisung.“ Der Bürgermeister von Covington, Joe Meyer, ein Demokrat, sagte, das „entsetzliche“ Filmmaterial habe zu Recht „eine Flutwelle der Verurteilung“ ausgelöst und seine Stadt werde nun wegen der Aktionen der Jungen mit „Intoleranz und ethnischer Einschüchterung“ in Verbindung gebracht. „Die Videos, die im ganzen Land geteilt werden, repräsentieren NICHT die Grundüberzeugungen und Werte dieser Stadt“, sagte er in einer Erklärung. In einem separaten Video, das in die sozialen Medien hochgeladen wurde, wischte sich der 64-jährige Phillips, ein Ältester des Omaha-Stammes in Nebraska, die Tränen weg, als er den Vorfall beschrieb. „Ich hörte sie sagen: ‚Bau diese Mauer, baue diese Mauer‘. Dies sind indigene Länder, wir sollten keine Mauern haben“, sagte er. „Ich wünschte, ich könnte diese Energie dieser jungen Masse junger Männer sehen, diese Energie darauf verwenden, dieses Land wirklich, wirklich großartig zu machen und den Hungernden zu helfen.“ Er sagte der Washington Post, dass er beim Trommeln an seine Frau Shoshana dachte, die vor fast vier Jahren an Knochenmarkkrebs starb, und an die Bedrohungen, denen indigene Gemeinschaften auf der ganzen Welt ausgesetzt sind. „Ich hatte das Gefühl, als würde der Geist durch mich sprechen“, sagte Phillips. Laut Medienberichten hält Phillips eine jährliche Zeremonie auf dem Arlington National Cemetery ab, um Veteranen der amerikanischen Ureinwohner zu ehren. Er ist ein bekannter indianischer Aktivist, der 2016-2017 zu den Anführern der Standing-Rock-Proteste gegen den Bau einer Ölpipeline in North Dakota gehörte. Die demokratische US-Kongressabgeordnete Deb Haaland, ein Mitglied des Laguna Pueblo-Stammes in New Mexico, sagte auf Twitter, Phillips habe sein Leben für sein Land riskiert und die Studenten hätten „eklatanten Hass, Respektlosigkeit und Intoleranz“ gezeigt.

353ed1f7	Die New York Times hatte 1984 keine Ahnung, dass ein Artikel, der tief in das Leben eines aufstrebenden Milliardärs eintaucht, schließlich als Bestätigung dafür wieder auftauchen würde, wie PERFEKT ein fitter Präsident Trump für diese Zeit in Amerika ist. Wir haben unten die Highlights für Sie herausgezogen, aber der gesamte Artikel ist unglaublich. Wer hätte das 1984 vorhersagen können? Nun, es scheint, dass die New York Times den brillanten Geschäftsmann Donald J. Trump als einen großartigen zukünftigen Präsidenten der Vereinigten Staaten beschrieben hat … DAS EXPANDIERENDE REICH VON DONALD TRUMP: „DONALD! HALLO DONALD! DONALD!« Die Männer schrien, begierig darauf, ihn beim Namen zu nennen. Eine Gewitterfront aus Zigarrenrauch sammelte sich über dem Ballsaal des Hotels, vollgepackt mit Ellbogen an Ellbogen für ein Sportforum zur Frühstücksstunde mit einer Menschenmenge, zu der einige der reichsten, mächtigsten und berühmtesten Männer New Yorks gehörten. Er hat keinen PR-Agenten. Seine Konkurrenten fragen sich, wie das sein kann, aber ihn im Sportforum zu beobachten, lieferte eine Erklärung. Während Führungskräfte der anderen Teams dem Publikum von Verhandlungs- und Schiedsproblemen erzählten, von schmutzigen Toiletten in ihren Arenen und Straßenkriminalität draußen und von „Versuchen, die Mets in die richtige Richtung zu lenken“, sagte er weiter, dass er „weitermachen“ werde Chaos schaffen“ für die N.F.L. und übrigens, dass er den Bau eines Kuppelstadions in New York plante.“ Donald Trump elektrisierte den Raum mit Rat-a-tat-tat-Enthüllungen und ließ Namen von Stars der N.F.L. Spieler und Trainer würde er innerhalb weniger Stunden unter Vertrag nehmen. ES IST NOCH NICHT 9 UHR. EINEN TAG MIT Donald Trump ZU VERBRINGEN ist wie einen Ferrari ohne Windschutzscheibe zu fahren. Es ist aufregend; er bekommt ein paar Käfer in den Zähnen. Obwohl ihn Ideen wie die Errichtung des höchsten Gebäudes der Welt am East River immer noch interessieren, schweifen seine Gedanken vom New Yorker Immobiliengeschäft ab. Er hat Leuten in der Kommunikationsbranche gesagt, dass er „sehr an Kommunikation interessiert“ ist, was wie ein 2.000-Pfund-Gorilla ist, der erwähnt, dass er sehr daran interessiert ist, Fleischfresser zu werden. Der Trump-Touch. Es hat einige Leute in New York dazu gebracht, Trump regelrecht anzubeten; Sie nennen ihn ein „Immobiliengenie“, das dazu beigetragen hat, die Stadt aus der Dunkelheit Mitte der 1970er Jahre in eine neue Ära des Glamours und der Aufregung zu führen. Mr. Trump nimmt daran keinen Anstoß. Viele Urban-Affairs-Experten sehen die Entwickler als Retter unserer postindustriellen Städte. „Angesichts des Weggangs der Industrie“, sagt George Sternlieb, Direktor des Center for Urban Policy Research an der Rutgers University, „und der schwindenden Bundes- und Staatshilfen brauchen unsere Städte dringend die Reichen. Städte fallen tendenziell in zwei Kategorien: Städte des Konsums und Städte ohne wirtschaftliche Basis.“ Die Reichen der Welt können leben, wo sie wollen, erklären die Experten; Mr. Trump führt sie nach New York. Umsatzsteuern, Benutzersteuern, Arbeitsplätze und daraus resultierende Lohnsteuern werden generiert. Dass Mr. Trump den Standort bekommen konnte, als jeder Immobilienentwickler auf der Welt fast alles dafür getan hätte, zeugt von Donald Trumps Beharrlichkeit und seinen Fähigkeiten als Verhandlungsführer. Dass er auf diesem Gelände ein Gebäude dieser Dimension errichten konnte, zeugt von seinem Feingefühl im Umgang mit dem Flächennutzungsplan. „Er hat die unheimliche Fähigkeit, Blut im Wasser zu riechen“, sagt ein Konkurrent. Er erwarb die Luftrechte über Tiffany, was ihm erlaubte, ein viel höheres Gebäude zu bauen, und ging zu Equitable, das ihm das Land für eine 50-prozentige Beteiligung an dem Projekt verkaufte. Am Tag zuvor hat er 3.000 Dollar an eine unglückliche Familie geschickt, über die er in der Zeitung berichtet hat, was er laut Frau Foerderer häufig tut. Für ein Milliarden-Dollar-Unternehmen sind nicht allzu viele Menschen in der Nähe. Donald Trump trifft oder billigt praktisch alle Entscheidungen. Scheinbar schreibt er nichts auf, sondern bewahrt Unmengen von Firmenakten als geistige Notizen auf. Louise M. Sunshine, Executive Vice President, sagt: „Wenn es nicht unmöglich ist, hat Donald einfach kein Interesse. Kreativität muss vorhanden sein. Geld ist schon lange nicht mehr das Objekt.“ Herr Trump stimmt dieser Einschätzung zu. „Er ist ein fast unglaublicher Verhandlungsführer“, sagt Irving Fischer von HRH Construction. „Ich bete nicht am Schrein von Donald Trump an“, sagt er, „aber unser Unternehmen hat es aufgegeben, mit ihm über die Kosten zu verhandeln. Wir sagen einfach: „Sagen Sie uns, was Sie wollen, Sie bekommen es sowieso.“ „Trump kann spüren, wenn Leute aus einem Projekt aussteigen wollen“, sagt ein Entwickler … Er vertraut seinem Instinkt und hat den Mut dazu auf sie einwirken.“ Roy M. Cohn, Mr. Trumps Freund und Anwalt, fügt hinzu: „Er hat das unheimliche Gefühl zu wissen, dass etwas ein gutes Geschäft ist, wenn es für alle anderen düster aussieht.“ Das war sein erster Deal in Manhattan, sein Kauf des Commodore Hotels in der East 42nd Street Mitte der 1970er Jahre, als sogar das Chrysler Building auf der anderen Straßenseite unter Zwangsvollstreckung stand. Fred Trump beschrieb die Bemühungen seines Sohnes, das Hotel zu kaufen, als „Kämpfe um einen Sitzplatz auf der Titanic.“ Aber, sagt Donald Trump, „ich sah all diese Leute aus dem Grand Central Terminal kommen, und ich sagte mir: ‚Wie schlimm kann das sein das sein?“ Er renovierte das Hotel komplett und eröffnete es als Grand Hyatt Hotel aus Chrom und Glas wieder. Er war stillschweigend eingezogen, hatte 14 verschiedene Leute geschickt, um 15 Parzellen Land zu kaufen, und dabei seinen Namen nicht erwähnt. „Wenn der Verkäufer Italiener war“, sagt Mr. Trump, „haben wir einen Italiener geschickt“ – etwas, das er wahrscheinlich nicht an der Wharton School of Finance der University of Pennsylvania gelernt hat, wo er einen B.A. in Wirtschaftswissenschaften im Jahr 1968. Er kaufte und verkaufte ein paar Immobilien in Philadelphia, als ihn der Unterricht langweilte. „Es liegt in seinen Genen“, erklärt Fred Trump den Erfolg seines Sohnes im Immobilienbereich und erinnert sich an seine drei Söhne, die auf Baustellen und in Mietbüros aufgewachsen sind. „Donald Trump ist der Michael Jackson der Immobilien“, sagt Herr Fischer. „Wir haben mit ihm zu tun, seit er 16 war. Mit 25 war er ein alter Trouper.“ Sein Erfolg beruht auch auf seinen Marketingfähigkeiten. „Ich möchte Immobilien ein wenig Showmanier verleihen“, sagt Mr. Trumps. Er wird oft mit dem verstorbenen William Zeckendorf, dem renommierten New Yorker Baumeister, verglichen, der einen Großteil seines Erfolgs seinem persönlichen Flair verdanken soll. Andere New Yorker Entwickler – darunter die Lefraks, die Rudins, die Tishmans, die Fishers, die Roses – bauen im Stillen mehr Gebäude als Donal Trump, machen ihre Millionen und halten sich aus den Dingen heraus. Einige Entwickler finden Mr. Trumps hochkarätigen Ansatz unangenehm, aber die meisten räumen ein, dass es für ihn funktioniert hat. Preston Robert Tisch, ein Entwickler und Chief Operating Officer der Loews Corporation, der im Kampf um die Wahl des Standorts für das Kongresszentrum der Stadt gegen Mr. Trump verlor, schlussfolgert: „Er hat die Vorstellungskraft der Menschen in größerem Maße gefesselt als ich könnte.“ Die Eigentumswohnungen im Trump Tower verkaufen sich schnell zu Preisen, die viele für exorbitant halten, während weniger kostspielige Einheiten im Museum Tower beispielsweise, einem anderen „Super-Luxus“-Gebäude ein paar Blocks entfernt, nicht so sind. Laut einer Marketingstudie der Rudential Insurance Company of America über vier solcher Gebäude scheint Donald Trump die einzige Person in New York zu sein, die weiß, wie man Luxuswohnungen vermarktet. Wie verkauft man eine Ein-Zimmer-Wohnung, die so viel kostet wie ein Einzelposten im Budget des Verteidigungsministeriums? „Du verkaufst ihnen eine Fantasie“, erklärt Mr. Trump. „Er verdient die volle Anerkennung für seinen Erfolg“, sagt ein anderer Bauunternehmer. „Er hat eine Million Dollar für den Wasserfall im Trump Tower ausgegeben. Niemand sonst hätte das getan. Wenn das Gebäude scheitert, werden alle sagen: „Na klar, welcher Idiot gibt eine Million Dollar für einen Wasserfall aus?“ „Was Trump auszeichnet“, sagt Ben V. Lambert, ein Immobilien-Investmentbanker, „ist seine Fähigkeit, die Leinwand zu durchdringen und Dinge zu erledigen. Er bringt Projekte buchstäblich auf den Weg, während andere Besprechungen abhalten und Machbarkeitsstudien durchführen . Aber seine wahre Fähigkeit besteht darin, komplexe Puzzleteile zusammenzusetzen: Verlobung, Zoneneinteilung, Grundstücke und so weiter. Dieser ätherische Teil des Bauens ist vielleicht wichtiger als der Ziegel und Mörtel.“ „Sie verwenden den Begriff „Siedlung“ nicht mit Donald.“ Mr. Trump setzt Geduld nicht auf seine Liste der Tugenden. Arbeiter bestätigen eine Geschichte, dass er 75.000 Dollar bezahlte, um mehrere 40-Fuß-Bäume von Florida zum Trump Tower zu transportieren, wo ein Tunnel in das Gebäude gebaut wurde, damit die Bäume nicht durch Frost beschädigt wurden. Die 3.000 Pfund schweren Bäume wurden dann auf dem unteren Platz des Atriums aufgestellt. Mr. Trump gefiel der Look nicht. Er befahl, die Bäume zu entfernen, und als die Arbeiter 24 Stunden lang säumten, ließ Mr. Trump die Bäume mit einer Kettensäge fällen. Er spricht langsam und leise und auf die gleiche beiläufige Weise mit bedeutenden Architekten und Geschäftsmogulen wie mit dem Kaffee- und Sandwichverkäufer vor seinem Casino-Hotel. Von Bekannten wird ihm nachgesagt, dass er im Allgemeinen ausgeglichen ist und selten zerzaust wirkt. Er neigt nicht zu unfreundlichen Bemerkungen und ist fast immer in einer positiven Stimmung. Ich denke nie an das Negative, sagt er. Alle Hindernisse können überwunden werden. Er spricht prahlerisch über seine Projekte, aber es ist ihm unangenehm, über sich selbst zu sprechen. Er raucht nicht und trinkt keinen Alkohol. Er spielt regelmäßig Golf und Tennis. Seine Frau beschreibt ihn als einen durch und durch amerikanischen Jungen, der Country-Musik am liebsten mag und Steak und Ofenkartoffel allem vorzieht, was man Küche nennt. Sein Vater zog Donald Trump aus einer Vorbereitungsschule, weil er nicht wollte, dass sein Sohn mit verwöhnten Kindern mit 40-Dollar-Ballhandschuhen aufwächst, und schickte ihn stattdessen auf die Militärschule. Sein Vater prahlte beim Sportforum damit, dass er mit der U-Bahn gefahren sei und 15 Dollar Autofahrt gespart habe. Mr. Trump scheint seiner Flut von Vermögen und Publicity einen distanzierten Blick gelassen zu haben. Er erwähnt häufig, dass all die Aufmerksamkeit und der Erfolg flüchtig sein könnten. Seine Freunde sagen, dass er sich seiner Station noch nicht ganz bewusst ist. Er liebt es, zum Mittagessen ins 21 zu kommen und sich von all den reichen, mächtigen, berühmten Leuten beeindrucken zu lassen, sagt ein Bekannter. Er merkt nicht recht, dass er einer von ihnen ist. Nach Einbruch der Dunkelheit fährt er auf dem Weg zum letzten Termin des Tages durch die Stadt und genießt die Lichter, die die ganze Stadt wie das Innere des Trump Tower funkeln lassen. Er sprach über seine Pläne für die Zukunft, so viel wie jeder, der mit Selbstverbrennung arbeitet. Um eine Erklärung gebeten, fügt er hinzu: Was bedeutet das alles, wenn irgendein Spinner drüben in Syrien die Welt mit Atomwaffen auslöschen kann? Er sagt, seine Besorgnis über den nuklearen Holocaust sei ihm bei keinem der letzten Fernsehfilme in den Sinn gekommen. Er sagt, dass es ihn beunruhigt, seit sein Onkel, ein Kernphysiker, vor 15 Jahren anfing, mit ihm darüber zu sprechen. Sein größter Traum ist es, persönlich etwas gegen das Problem zu unternehmen, und charakteristischerweise glaubt Donald Trump, er habe eine Antwort auf die nukleare Aufrüstung: Lassen Sie ihn Waffenabkommen aushandeln – er, der die Leute dazu bringen kann, ihm 100-Millionen-Dollar-Immobilien für 13 Millionen Dollar zu verkaufen. Verhandeln ist eine Kunst, sagt er, und ich habe eine Begabung dafür. Die Vorstellung, dass es ihm jemals erlaubt sein würde, alleine in einen Raum zu kommen und für die Vereinigten Staaten zu verhandeln, geschweige denn bei der Entwaffnung der Welt erfolgreich zu sein, scheint die naive Grübelei eines optimistischen, verblendeten jungen Mannes zu sein, der noch nie bei allem, was er versucht hat, verloren hat . Aber er glaubt, dass es eines Tages passieren könnte, wenn er seine Ansichten jahrelang bekannt macht und Candidades unterstützt, die seine Ansichten teilen. Immer wieder wird er nach seinem Interesse gefragt, für ein Wahlamt zu kandidieren. Absolut nicht, antwortet er. All das falsche Lächeln und die Bürokratie. Es ist zu schwierig, wirklich etwas zu tun. Er mag Meetings und Papierkram nicht und ist in der beneidenswerten Position, beides vermeiden zu können.

16ce44aa	Der republikanische Senator und Kandidat für das Amt des Gouverneurs, Michael Williams, kündigte seinen Widerstand gegen die Regulierung oder das Verbot von Bump Stocks an. Das Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms hat in einem Memo aus dem Jahr 2015 festgestellt, dass Bump Stocks nicht mechanisch sind und daher nicht unter das Waffenverbot für Maschinengewehre von 1986 fallen. Ein Angriff auf Bump Stocks ist ein Angriff auf die zweite Änderung. Aus Solidarität mit Waffenbesitzern im ganzen Land verschenkt Michael Williams an einen glücklichen Gewinner einen kostenlosen Vorrat. Williams sagte: „Die Tragödie in Las Vegas hat mir das Herz gebrochen, aber jedes Gerede über das Verbot oder die Regulierung von Bump Stocks ist nur ein billiges politisches Lippenbekenntnis von Berufspolitikern. In Wirklichkeit ist die Bump-Aktie das neue, glänzende Objekt, mit dem Politiker den Wählern vorgaukeln, sie würden gegen Waffengewalt vorgehen. Viele Schusswaffenexperten stellten fest, dass die Verwendung eines Stoßschafts durch den Schützen aus Las Vegas aufgrund seiner Inkonsistenz, Ungenauigkeit und mangelnden Kontrolle tatsächlich mehr Opfer und Verletzungen verhinderte. Es gibt keine Beweise dafür, dass das Verbot von Bump Stocks Todesfälle durch Waffengewalt verhindern würde. Georgiens Waffenbesitzer verdienen einen Gouverneur, der ihnen beisteht, wenn Liberale und Hollywood-Eliten unsere Grundrechte angreifen. Deshalb trete ich für die zweite Änderung ein und verschenke als Zeichen meiner Unterstützung eine Bump-Aktie.“ „Wenn Politiker ein echtes Gespräch über die Reduzierung von Waffengewalt führen wollten, würden sie über das Bewusstsein für psychische Gesundheit und Möglichkeiten zur Reduzierung des wöchentlichen Blutbads in Chicago und anderen Innenstädten diskutieren. Sie können das Böse nicht aus der Existenz regulieren. Waffen oder Aktien für die Taten eines Verrückten verantwortlich zu machen, ist dasselbe wie McDonald’s für Herzkrankheiten verantwortlich zu machen“, fuhr Williams fort. „Ich werde mich für den zweiten Verfassungszusatz gegen Liberale und schwache Republikaner einsetzen, die unsere Freiheiten einschränken wollen. Nicht nur das, ich werde weiterhin Demokraten und Republikaner herausfordern, die eher billige Reden und Ausreden als Lösungen liefern.“ ### BUMP STOCK GIVEAWAY LINK https://williamsgeorgia.com/bump-stock-giveaway/	Diese geschlechtsneutralen Schulen wollen Klischees zerschlagen	false

6378a0ff	Eine Koalition zivilgesellschaftlicher Gruppen hat das vorgeschlagene Gesetz zur Kontrolle von Infektionskrankheiten als Bedrohung der Menschenrechte bezeichnet. Die Gruppe, insgesamt 41, sagte, das Repräsentantenhaus müsse den Gesetzentwurf einer öffentlichen Prüfung unterziehen, indem es Konsultationen der Interessengruppen und eine öffentliche Anhörung einleite, um öffentliche Beiträge in die Gesetzgebung einzubeziehen. Viele Nigerianer hatten einen Schritt des Repräsentantenhauses kritisiert, das Quarantänegesetz aufzuheben und durch das Gesetz zur Kontrolle von Infektionskrankheiten zu ersetzen. Der Gesetzentwurf, der in zweiter Lesung skaliert wurde, bevor er letzte Woche zurückgezogen wurde, hat 82 Abschnitte. Der von der Sprecherin des Repräsentantenhauses, Femi Gbajabiamila, gesponserte Gesetzesentwurf zielt darauf ab, das Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) zu stärken und es proaktiver und „nicht nur reaktiv und funktionsfähig zu machen, wenn es einen Ausbruch gibt“. Der Gesetzentwurf soll den Präsidenten, den Gesundheitsminister sowie den Generaldirektor des NCDC und die von ihnen geleiteten Institutionen ermächtigen, Vorschriften zur Quarantäne, Impfung und Prävention von Infektionskrankheiten in Nigeria zu erlassen. Position der CSOs In einer Erklärung, die am Dienstag veröffentlicht wurde, sagten die Gruppen, der Gesetzentwurf ermächtige NCDC, die Grundrechte und -freiheiten der Menschen einzuschränken. „Der Gesetzentwurf ermächtigt das NCDC, Grundrechte und -freiheiten nach Belieben einzuschränken und verfassungsmäßig festgelegte Institutionen und Verfahren zu missbrauchen, ohne jede Form von Rechenschaftspflicht. „Zum Beispiel gibt Abschnitt 10 (3) dem Generaldirektor die ausdrückliche Befugnis, ohne Haftbefehl Gewalt anzuwenden, um Räumlichkeiten zu betreten“, hieß es. Die Gruppe sagte auch, der Gesetzentwurf verstoße gegen die wichtigsten Grundsätze der Gesetzesentwürfe, die Gesetze vorschreiben, einfach, klar und eindeutig zu sein. Es forderte daher die sofortige Überprüfung aller Bestimmungen des Gesetzentwurfs. „Der Gesetzentwurf verstößt gegen zentrale Grundsätze der Gesetzgebungsvorschriften, die Gesetze vorschreiben, einfach, klar und eindeutig zu sein. „Dies lässt Raum für einen erheblichen Ermessensspielraum seitens der Durchführungsbehörden und schränkt die Rechte der Bürger und der jeweiligen Institutionen ein, Entscheidungen in Frage zu stellen, die in Ausübung der im Gesetz vorgesehenen Befugnisse getroffen wurden. „Wir fordern eine Überprüfung aller Bestimmungen des Gesetzentwurfs, die Konflikte zwischen Behörden und Machtmissbrauch fördern und verfassungsmäßig garantierte Rechte untergraben und gegen die Rechtsstaatlichkeit und die internationalen Menschenrechtsverpflichtungen Nigerias verstoßen.“ Zu den Gruppen gehören: Girl Child Africa, Centre For Liberty, Centre for Democracy and Development, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, Say No Campaign, Amnesty International, YIAGA Africa, Human and Environmental Development Agenda, Global Rights und African Centre for Media and Information Literacy .

Anschuldigungen Am Dienstag sagte Herr Gbajabiamila, die Anschuldigung, dass die Gesetzesvorlage ein finsterer Versuch sei, Nigerianer zu Versuchskaninchen für die medizinische Forschung zu machen und ihnen gleichzeitig ihre grundlegenden Menschenrechte zu nehmen, sei weit von der Wahrheit entfernt. Er sagte, als Vertreter des nigerianischen Volkes würden Mitglieder des Repräsentantenhauses niemals in Betracht ziehen, etwas zu tun, was das Wohlergehen der Bürger gefährden würde. WERBUNG Er versprach, dass während der Prüfung des Gesetzentwurfs eine öffentliche Anhörung stattfinden würde.	in	true
6bb4fea4	Thank you to Universities UK UUK for hosting us today. In my first speech on universities a month ago, I addressed the subject of international education. I am proud of the sector’s international standing and reputation around the world. Today, I want to reflect further on what underpins this excellence, and what more we can do to enhance it. At the root of that success is the autonomy and academic freedom that enables us to attract brilliant people to work in and run our universities and lead our sectoral bodies. I’d like to congratulate Nicola Dandridge for her recent CBE and thank outgoing UUK President, Chris Snowden, for his excellent service. I would also like to congratulate Dame Julia Goodfellow on taking over the UUK Presidency – the first woman to hold the post ever, I believe in around 100 years of the existence of UUK and its predecessor body. Success of the sector The higher education sector can be proud of its success over the last 5 years and I want to pay tribute to my colleagues David Willetts and Greg Clark for their part in the reforms that have helped sustain the high esteem in which it is held around the world. We have seen: a transformed financial situation; as the OECD says, we are one of the only countries in the world to have found a way of sustainably funding higher education we have seen record numbers of young people entering higher education, including record numbers from disadvantaged backgrounds and we have seen record numbers of graduates in work; the recent Graduate Labour Market statistics showed the highest employment rate for working age graduates since 2007 at 87.5% through all this, the UK has retained its place as a world leader in HE , with 4 universities in the global top 10, and as number one in the world for the impact of our research Unfinished business It’s a great success story, but there is unfinished business and, in the coming months, my focus will be on implementing 3 key manifesto pledges, so that we consolidate and build on these achievements: firstly, lifting the cap on student numbers and widening participation, so that we remove barriers to ambition and meet the PM’s commitment to double the proportion of disadvantaged young people entering higher education by 2020 from 2009 levels secondly, delivering a teaching excellence framework that creates incentives for universities to devote as much attention to the quality of teaching as fee-paying students and prospective employers have a right to expect thirdly, driving value for money both for students investing in their education, and taxpayers underwriting the system, so that we ensure the continuing success and stability of these reforms Taking these points in reverse order. Meeting value for money expectations Around now, the first cohort of students to enter under the 2012 reforms is preparing to enter the labour market. They have been working hard for their final exams and made a significant investment in higher education. They are looking critically at what they get for that investment, and so must we, as a government, on behalf of taxpayers. I am concerned that recent surveys – the HEPI-HEA Student Academic Experience Survey, as well as a BBC/ComRes poll – showed that only around half of students felt their course had provided good value for money. All of us need to reflect on this and on what we can do to address such unease. More informed choices Thanks to the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act passed in March, we can now start to assess the employment and earnings returns to education by matching Department for Business, Innovation and Skills BIS and Department for Education DfE education data with HMRC employment and income data and Department for Work and Pensions DWP benefits data. Information of this sort will be incredibly useful for young people choosing courses or jobs that are most suitable for them. It will also enable education providers to assess their effectiveness in delivering positive labour market outcomes for their students. I am also pleased to see the piloting of new National Student Survey questions that measure the engagement of students with their course, staff and fellow students. This was shown in the US to be a good proxy for the value add of a university in terms of ‘learning gain’ - the improvement in knowledge, skills and work-readiness that students demonstrate over time. While independent learning is vital, universities must get used to providing clearer information about how many hours students will spend in lectures, seminars and tutorials, and who will deliver the teaching. Indeed the Competition and Markets Authority have advised higher education providers that information should be available to prospective students to meet the requirements of consumer law. I know this is already on the sector’s agenda. I will continue to push for more data to be made available, including for alternative providers. A Higher Education Policy Institute Hepi survey suggests as many as three-quarters of undergraduates want more information about where their fees go – and I sympathise with that. Such transparency looks to me like an essential way of addressing value for money concerns. More competition More competition will also be central to our efforts to drive up standards. In the last 3 years, we have seen more universities created than at any time since the 1992 expansion. We are committed to promoting high quality market entry, whilst at the same time ensuring a regulatory regime which guards against poor quality provision. More competition and more informed choice will help drive up value for money for both students and taxpayers. Graduate premium The graduate earnings premium is an important measure of the value universities add and of the greater productivity of those with skills acquired in higher education. Of course, many graduates will consciously choose to go into occupations that do not maximise their incomes – we must remember that education is about more than just wage returns. Indeed, that is the reason we have a progressive repayment system for student loans. But it is also important to remember that higher lifetime graduate earnings provide benefits to society – including higher tax revenues and faster and fuller repayment of student loans. Evidence of a decline in the graduate earnings premium is therefore a concern as we look to drive up productivity in the economy, secure our public finances and ensure our higher education system continues to be funded in a sustainable way. Between 2006 and 2015, the graduate earnings premium decreased from around 55% higher to around 45% higher than the earnings of non-graduates, with graduates now earning on average £31k and non-graduates £22,000. There is still a considerable benefit – but we cannot be complacent and must analyse why the premium employers pay for graduates is falling at a time when graduate-level skills are in growing demand. Course choice and curriculum design An important part of the answer is that we are not yet rising to the challenge of ensuring that enough young people are choosing courses where there are skills shortages and strong employer demand – notably in science, technology, engineering and mathematics STEM . Nor are we doing enough to ensure that all students emerge from university prepared for work. Last year’s CBI /Pearson Education and Skills survey suggested that 47% of employers felt universities should do more to help students become job-ready. Government, business and the university sector need to come together to address this mismatch between supply and demand in the graduate labour market. Businesses should not just be seen as customers of universities, recruiting the graduates they educate or buying research expertise, but as active partners. Universities need to develop business-outreach into a core function that has influence over curriculum design. Closer partnership between universities and business will help us tackle the misguided view that ‘more means worse’ and ensure that the investment both students and taxpayers make in higher education provides visible returns. Teaching Excellence Framework TEF Above all, to meet students’ high expectations of their university years and to deliver the skills our economy needs, we need a renewed focus on teaching. This is vital unfinished business from the reforms of the last Parliament. As David Willetts himself acknowledged in a recent interview with the Times Higher Education; “teaching has been by far the weakest aspect of English higher education”. This must change. There must be recognition of excellent teaching – and clear incentives to make ‘good’ teaching even better. Some rebalancing of the pull between teaching and research is undoubtedly required. It is striking that while we have a set of measures to reward high quality research, backed by substantial funding the Research Excellence Framework, there is nothing equivalent to drive up standards in teaching. That is why my priority as Universities Minister will be to make sure students get the teaching they deserve and employers get graduates with the skills they need by introducing the Teaching Excellence Framework we promised in our manifesto. Aims for the TEF My aims for the TEF are: to ensure all students receive an excellent teaching experience that encourages original thinking, drives up engagement and prepares them for the world of work to build a culture where teaching has equal status with research, with great teachers enjoying the same professional recognition and opportunities for career and pay progression as great researchers to stimulate a diverse HE market and provide students with the information they need to judge teaching quality – in the same way they can already compare a faculty’s research rating market and provide students with the information they need to judge teaching quality – in the same way they can already compare a faculty’s research rating to recognise those institutions that do the most to welcome students from a range of backgrounds and support their retention and progression to further study or a graduate job I expect the TEF to include a clear set of outcome-focused criteria and metrics. This should be underpinned by an external assessment process undertaken by an independent quality body from within the existing landscape. Believe me, I have no intention of replicating the individual and institutional burdens of the REF . I am clear that any external review must be proportionate and light touch, not big, bossy and bureaucratic. I want to work with you all, as well as with the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the Quality Assurance Agency, to design a framework that has widespread support and works for the sector, as well as students and employers and taxpayers. This is not happening in isolation. It goes with the grain of our reforms since 2010 and aims to accelerate positive changes already underway in the sector. We will be consulting widely and I am not pre-empting what any of the incentives might look like. I am keen to hear your views ahead of a green paper, which the Department of Business, Innovation and SkiIls plans to publish in the autumn. Maintaining the value of our degrees One of the things I want to focus on in the green paper is how the TEF can help improve the information that matters most for graduates and employers: the degree classification. Here we face a significant challenge. The UK’s standard model of classes of honours is on its own no longer capable of providing the recognition hardworking students deserve and the information employers require. Students across the country have just finished their exams and are looking for good graduate jobs. Last week’s High Fliers survey reminded us that the class of 2015 is more career-oriented than ever before. They rightly want hard work at university to be recognised and for their degree to be a currency that carries prestige and holds its value. At the same time, businesses need a degree classification system that will help them identify the best applicants for their firms. I know the sector is starting to tackle this need for richer information through the Higher Education Achievement Report and this is a valuable development, but this work needs greater urgency. Let me explain why: There has been a significant increase in the proportion of people receiving firsts and 2:1 degrees. To the extent this expansion in the number of firsts and 2:1s is to do with rising levels of attainment and hard work, I applaud it. But I suspect I am not alone in worrying that less benign forces are at work with the potential to damage the UK higher education brand. On the face of it, the facts are certainly startling. There has been a 300% increase in the percentage of firsts since the 1990s. Over 70% of graduates now get a First or 2:1 – up by 7 percentage points in the past 5 years. And compared to just 47% in the mid-1990s. In 2013 to 14, over 50% of students were awarded an upper second, suggesting that this grade band not only disguises considerable variation in attainment, but also permits some to coast. The Higher Education Academy found that nearly half of institutions had changed their degree algorithms to; “ensure that their students were not disadvantaged compared to those in other institutions”. The Teaching Excellence Framework we will introduce will include incentives for the sector to tackle degree inflation and ensure that hard-won qualifications hold their value. I want the green paper to look at the role that external examiners play in underpinning standards and ensuring our grading system provides a clearer, more comparable picture of student attainment. Stronger student engagement I also want to make sure that the Teaching Excellence Framework encourages universities to adopt a grading system that does more to motivate and engage students throughout their course. The familiar pattern of a First, 2:1 and 2:2, Third is widely recognised. But providing extra granularity through a grade point average GPA – a 13 point scale developed by the sector – will encourage consistent effort, make it less easy to coast within the 2:1 band and give employers more information about candidates within that classification. It is vital that we continue to drive up student engagement. Students are working harder than before and that is a welcome trend, which we want to support through the Teaching Excellence Framework. But many full time students are still not being sufficiently stretched. In the most recent Student Academic Experience Survey, the total weekly workload reported by students averages 30.5 hours, including 14 hours of independent study, and varies greatly by subject. The reported weekly workload on courses such as Mass Communications and Documentation is as little as 22 hours. Students are telling us in surveys that they know they would do better by investing more time in their studies. As a more finely-calibrated long-run batting average, GPA should drive greater student engagement than our present system, which, notwithstanding more summative coursework, in many ways can still look like a snapshot performance measure. I know Sir Robert Burgess, chair of the Grade Point Average Advisory Group, has predicted all UK universities will adopt the model by the end of the decade. I support this goal and want the green paper to examine how the new Teaching Excellence Framework can encourage universities to adopt dual running of the GPA and honours degree system, as recommended in the recent Higher Education Academy report. Widening participation My focus has of course been on students and the job market. But this does not mean we overlook the value of learning for its own sake, or the role of higher education in social mobility. The 2012 reforms mean that anyone with the ability can now make going to university their goal, a fact underscored by our decision to lift the cap on student numbers altogether from this academic year. Anyone with potential to benefit from university should not be prevented from going because of their background or ability to pay. But of course there is still more to do. The Prime Minister has set an ambitious goal to double the proportion of those from disadvantaged backgrounds progressing into higher education by 2020 compared with 2009. I will challenge you to do all you can to reach this target. That’s why I am delighted that Professor Les Ebdon has agreed to extend his term as director of the Office of Fair Access to help us fulfil a commitment that is central to this One Nation Government’s aim to promote social mobility in this country. In particular, I want to see more progress being made in the most selective institutions. Data from UCAS shows the clear progress that the sector has made, and I applaud that. I want to see more outreach and more innovation in terms of course length and design. Degree Apprenticeships and 2-year courses in particular offer a more accessible route to a higher education and a faster path to productive employment. We also need to match our efforts on driving up fair access by also ensuring those young people succeed in getting a good qualification and have an opportunity to find a fulfilling career. I know that this ‘whole student lifecycle’ approach is one that you are taking seriously – and it is embedded in the National Strategy for Access and Student Success. I expect our new Teaching Excellence Framework to include incentives that reward institutions who do best at retention and progression of disadvantaged students through their college years. Conclusion I recognise that this is a challenging agenda and that you are already focused on many of these issues. We will be working with closely with universities and with the grain of reforms that have put power and choice in the hands of students. Those institutions that can demonstrate that they excel in teaching and in supporting all students – including those from disadvantaged backgrounds – through university into graduate jobs will reap rewards. If we can get this right – on driving value for money for students and taxpayers on creating incentives to encourage excellent teaching and on widening participation – then I’m confident we can together make a world-leading higher education sector greater still.

69e7cad4	GEORGIEN WIRD DER ERSTE STAAT, DER DIE MUSLIMISCHE KULTUR IN EINEM HISTORISCHEN SCHRITT ZUR WIEDERHERSTELLUNG WESTLICHER WERTE VERBOTE!!! Als Donald Trump 2015 vorschlug, Muslimen die Einreise in die Vereinigten Staaten vorübergehend zu verbieten, geschah dies zu einer Zeit, als Europa ein historisches Ausmaß an Migration und Terrorismus erlebte. ISIS führte wöchentlich Terroranschläge durch und Hunderte von unschuldigen Menschen wurden getötet. Ob es ein Dschihad war, der über 85 Menschen mit einem Lastwagen anfuhr, die Bombenanschläge von Paris oder sogar der deutsche Priester, der geköpft wurde, weil er Christ war – sie alle wurden vom Islam angetrieben. Die Menschen müssen verstehen, dass der Islam sehr gefährlich ist und allem widerspricht, was wir in den Vereinigten Staaten glauben. Ein Gesetzgeber des Bundesstaates Georgia hat ein Gesetz eingeführt, das Burkas und traditionelle muslimische Schleier verbieten würde. Staatsabgeordneter Jason Spencer (R) reichte am Mittwoch ein Gesetz ein, das Frauen daran hindern würde, für Führerscheinfotos zu posieren, während sie einen Schleier tragen. Die Maßnahme fügt auch Burkas zu einem Gesetz hinzu, das das Tragen einer Gesichtsbedeckung in der Öffentlichkeit oder beim Autofahren zu einem Vergehen macht. Spencer argumentiert, dass dieser Gesetzentwurf speziell darauf abzielt, die Angst vor dem islamistischen Terrorismus zu verringern. Spencers Gesetzentwurf würde Frauen daran hindern, beim Autofahren oder beim Gehen auf einem öffentlichen Bürgersteig Kopfbedeckungen zu tragen. „Dieses Gesetz ist einfach eine Reaktion auf Wähler, die Bedenken hinsichtlich des Aufstiegs des islamischen Terrorismus haben, und wir im Bundesstaat Georgia wollen nicht, dass unsere Gesetze gegen uns verwendet werden“, sagte Spencer gegenüber WSB-TV in Atlanta. Viele Menschen werden dies sofort lesen und argumentieren, dass der erste Verfassungszusatz den Schutz der Religionsfreiheiten zulässt, und das ist ein wahres und richtiges Argument. Unsere Verfassung erlaubt es allen Bürgern, jede Religion auszuüben, die sie wählen. Hier ist das Problem: Der Islam ist keine Religion. Es ist eine Krebskrankheit, die dazu aufruft, alle Christen, Frauen und Homosexuellen für den falschen Gott Allah brutal zu ermorden. Die überwiegende Mehrheit der Terroranschläge wird im Namen Allahs verübt. Wann haben wir das letzte Mal einen Terroranschlag von jemandem erlebt, der die Bibel zitiert hat? Koran 8:12: Ich werde Schrecken in die Herzen derer werfen, die ungläubig sind. Deshalb schlagt ihnen den Kopf ab und schlagt ihnen jede Fingerspitze ab. Ich werde Schrecken in die Herzen derer werfen, die ungläubig sind. Deshalb schlagt ihnen den Kopf ab und schlagt ihnen jede Fingerspitze ab. Koran 9:29: Kämpfe gegen diejenigen, die weder an Allah noch an den Jüngsten Tag glauben, noch verbieten, was von Allah und Seinem Gesandten verboten wurde, und diejenigen, die die Religion der Wahrheit (d.h. den Islam) unter den Menschen der Schrift (Juden und Christen), bis sie die Jizya mit bereitwilliger Unterwerfung zahlen und sich unterworfen fühlen. Bekämpft diejenigen, die weder an Allah noch an den Jüngsten Tag glauben, noch verbieten, was von Allah und Seinem Gesandten verboten wurde, und diejenigen, die die Religion der Wahrheit (d.h. den Islam) unter den Leuten der Schrift (Juden und Christen) nicht anerkennen ), bis sie die Jizya mit bereitwilliger Unterwerfung zahlen und sich unterworfen fühlen. Koran 3:151: Bald werden Wir Schrecken in die Herzen der Ungläubigen werfen, weil sie sich Allahs Gefährten angeschlossen haben, wofür Er keine Autorität gesandt hat. Ist es das, was wir in unserem Land, unseren Schulen und Gemeinden erblühen lassen wollen? Nur für den Anfang haben die Liberalen bereits das Schulgebet verboten, weil christliche Werte jemanden beleidigen könnten – also wie ist das anders? Es gibt einen Unterschied zwischen Hijab und Burka. Spencer argumentiert, dass wir die Vollverhüllung verbieten sollten, die Frauen von Kopf bis Fuß verhüllt. Während die Liberalen diese Aktion verurteilen werden, akzeptieren sie sie besser, weil sie einen Schneeballeffekt in den Vereinigten Staaten haben wird. Außerhalb von Georgien beginnen mehrere andere Staaten damit, ähnliche Gesetze vorzuschlagen. Die Bedrohung durch den Islam und diejenigen, die ihn praktizieren, ist so groß, dass Frankreich und Belgien Burkas und ähnliche Verkleidungen insgesamt verboten haben, um zu versuchen, die Sicherheit der Bürger zu gewährleisten. Lokale Regierungen in Italien, Spanien und der Schweiz haben ebenfalls Verbote erlassen. Bei diesem Schritt geht es darum, das amerikanische Volk zu schützen. Unter Präsident Trump werden wir alles Notwendige tun, um die Sicherheit des amerikanischen Volkes zu gewährleisten.

a9994f18	Ein südafrikanischer Pastor, Alfred Ndlovu, ist an Unterernährung gestorben, nachdem er 30 Tage lang ohne Nahrung ausgekommen war, als er versuchte, Jesus Christus nachzueifern und 40 Tage und 40 Nächte fastete. Buzz South Africa berichtet, dass der 44-jährige Pastor am 17. Juni sein Zuhause verlassen hat, um in einem nahe gelegenen Busch zu beten, genau wie Jesus es getan hat. Bei dem Versuch, den Rekord von Jesus Christus im Fasten von 40 Tagen zu erreichen oder zu brechen, starb Herr Alfred Ndlovu nur einen Monat, obwohl er keine Krankheitsgeschichte hatte. Er war allein in der Wildnis und seine Leiche wurde von einem Fremden gefunden, der daraufhin die Polizei rief. Er war in seiner Familie und seiner Gemeinde allgemein als eine sehr spirituelle Person bekannt, deren Glaube Berge versetzen konnte, und sein Tod überraschte alle, sogar die Mitglieder der Kirche. Ein naher Verwandter sagte: „Er war ein sehr spiritueller Mann. Schade, dass er auf diese Weise sterben musste. Nach einem Monat erreichte uns die traurige Nachricht von seinem Tod. Der Pfarrer war ein gesunder und religiöser Greis, dem man sein Alter nicht einmal ansah.	Joy Covey: Amazon-Pionierin und High-Tech-Rockstar starb mit 50 bei einem Fahrradunfall in Woodside	other
0765375b	(Natural News) Seit mehr als 60 Jahren weiß die National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), dass die Änderungen der planetarischen Wettermuster völlig natürlich und normal sind. Aber die Weltraumbehörde hat sich aus welchen Gründen auch immer dafür entschieden, den vom Menschen verursachten Schwindel der globalen Erwärmung fortbestehen und sich ausbreiten zu lassen, zum Nachteil der menschlichen Freiheit. Um genau zu sein, war es das Jahr 1958, als die NASA erstmals beobachtete, dass Änderungen in der Sonnenumlaufbahn der Erde zusammen mit Änderungen der Erdachsenneigung beide für das verantwortlich sind, was Klimawissenschaftler heute als „Erwärmung“ (oder „ Kühlung“, je nach Agenda). In keiner Weise, Form oder Form erwärmen oder kühlen Menschen den Planeten, indem sie SUVs fahren oder Rindfleisch essen, mit anderen Worten. Aber die NASA hat es bisher versäumt, den Rekord richtig zu stellen, und hat sich stattdessen entschieden, sich still zurückzulehnen und zuzusehen, wie die Liberalen darüber ausflippen, dass die Welt angeblich in 12 Jahren untergeht, weil zu viel Vieh oder zu viele Plastikstrohhalme. Im Jahr 2000 veröffentlichte die NASA auf ihrer Earth Observatory-Website Informationen über die Milankovitch-Klimatheorie, die enthüllten, dass sich der Planet tatsächlich aufgrund äußerer Faktoren verändert, die absolut nichts mit menschlicher Aktivität zu tun haben. Aber noch einmal, diese Information muss 19 Jahre später noch in den Mainstream gehen, weshalb geistesgestörte, klimabesessene Linke jetzt damit beginnen zu behaupten, dass wir wirklich nur noch 18 Monate haben, bevor der Planet an einem Überschuss an Kohlendioxid stirbt ( CO2). Die Wahrheit entspricht jedoch viel mehr dem, was der serbische Astrophysiker Milutin Milankovitch, nach dem die Milankovitch-Klimatheorie benannt ist, darüber vorgeschlagen hat, wie die saisonalen und Breitengradschwankungen der Sonnenstrahlung auf unterschiedliche Weise und zu unterschiedlichen Zeiten auf die Erde treffen , haben den größten Einfluss auf die sich ändernden Klimamuster der Erde. Die beiden folgenden Bilder (von Robert Simmon, NASA GSFC) helfen, dies zu veranschaulichen, wobei das erste die Erde auf einer Umlaufbahn von nahezu Null und das zweite die Erde auf einer Umlaufbahn von 0,07 zeigt. Diese Bahnänderung wird durch die exzentrische, ovale Form im zweiten Bild dargestellt, die absichtlich übertrieben wurde, um die massive Abstandsänderung zu zeigen, die zwischen Erde und Sonne auftritt, je nachdem, ob sie sich im Perihel oder im Aphel befindet. „Selbst die maximale Exzentrizität der Erdumlaufbahn – 0,07 – wäre unmöglich in der Auflösung einer Webseite darzustellen“, bemerkt die Hal Turner Radio Show. „Trotzdem ist die Erde bei der aktuellen Exzentrizität von 0,017 am Perihel 5 Millionen Kilometer näher an der Sonne als am Aphel.“ Weitere verwandte Nachrichten über den Klimawandel und die globale Erwärmung aus einer unabhängigen, nicht etablierten Perspektive finden Sie auf ClimateScienceNews.com. Der größte Faktor, der das Klima der Erde beeinflusst, ist die SONNE Was die Neigung der Erde oder ihre Änderung der axialen Neigung betrifft, zeigen die beiden Bilder unten (Robert Simmon, NASA GSFC), inwieweit sich die Erde sowohl um ihre Achse als auch um ihre Rotationsausrichtung verschieben kann. Bei höheren Neigungen werden die Jahreszeiten der Erde viel extremer, während sie bei niedrigeren Neigungen viel milder werden. Eine ähnliche Situation besteht für die Rotationsachse der Erde, die je nachdem, welche Hemisphäre während des Perihels auf die Sonne gerichtet ist, die saisonalen Extreme zwischen den beiden Hemisphären stark beeinflussen kann. Basierend auf diesen verschiedenen Variablen war Milankovitch in der Lage, ein umfassendes mathematisches Modell zu entwickeln, das in der Lage ist, Oberflächentemperaturen auf der Erde zu berechnen, die weit in die Vergangenheit zurückreichen, und die Schlussfolgerung ist einfach: Das Klima der Erde hat sich immer verändert und ist konstant Zustand des Wandels ohne eigenes Verschulden als Menschen. Als Milankovitch sein Modell zum ersten Mal vorstellte, wurde es fast ein halbes Jahrhundert lang ignoriert. Dann, 1976, bestätigte eine in der Zeitschrift Science veröffentlichte Studie, dass Milankovitchs Theorie tatsächlich zutreffend ist und dass sie sich auf verschiedene Perioden des Klimawandels bezieht, die im Laufe der Geschichte aufgetreten sind. 1982, sechs Jahre nach der Veröffentlichung dieser Studie, nahm der National Research Council der U.S. National Academy of Sciences Milankovitchs Theorie als Wahrheit an und erklärte: „… Orbitalvariationen bleiben der am gründlichsten untersuchte Mechanismus des Klimawandels auf Zeitskalen von mehreren zehn Tausenden von Jahren und sind bei weitem der klarste Fall einer direkten Auswirkung einer sich ändernden Sonneneinstrahlung auf die untere Atmosphäre der Erde.“ Wenn wir das Ganze in einem einfachen Satz zusammenfassen müssten, wäre es dieser: Der größte Faktor, der Wetter- und Klimamuster auf der Erde beeinflusst, ist die Sonne, Punkt. Abhängig von der Position der Erde zur Sonne zu einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt werden die Klimabedingungen dramatisch variieren und sogar drastische Anomalien schaffen, die allem widersprechen, was die Menschen über die Funktionsweise der Erde zu wissen glaubten. Aber anstatt diese Wahrheit anzunehmen, bestehen die heutigen Klima-„Wissenschaftler“, zusammen mit linken Politikern und mitschuldigen Mainstream-Medien, darauf, dass der Verzicht auf wiederverwendbare Einkaufstüten im Supermarkt und der Verzicht auf Elektrofahrzeuge den Planeten so schnell zerstören, dass wir dies unbedingt umsetzen müssen globale Klimasteuern als Lösung. „Bei der Debatte über den Klimawandel geht es nicht um Wissenschaft. Es ist ein Versuch, der Bevölkerung politische und wirtschaftliche Kontrolle durch die Elite aufzuerlegen“, schrieb ein Kommentator in der Hal Turner Radio Show. „Und es ist ein weiterer Weg, die Bevölkerung gegen sich selbst zu spalten, mit einigen, die an die menschengemachte globale Erwärmung glauben, und anderen, die dies nicht tun, d.h. Teile und herrsche.“ Sie können den vollständigen Hal Turner Radio Show Bericht unter diesem Link lesen.

cef0a3d1	Beruf: Präsident und CEO, Bettencourt Tax Advisors L.L.C. Legislative Erfahrung: Senatsmitglied: 2015 – heute Partei: Republikaner Senator Paul Bettencourt wurde 2014 erstmals in den Senat gewählt und vertritt den Senatsbezirk 7, der den größten Teil von West Harris County umfasst. Zuvor war er 10 Jahre lang, von 1998 bis 2008, als Tax Assessor-Collector von Harris County tätig, wo er „Smart Government“ beim Finanzamt von Harris County einführte und eine kundenorientierte Organisation aufbaute. Sein Team erstellte das erste große Online-Zahlungssystem für Grundsteuern und die erste Website des County Tax Office mit Online-Fahrzeugregistrierung in Texas. (Sein Motto war „Get on-line, not in-line“.) Er war bekannt als „Tax Man“ für seine unverblümten Bemühungen, die Grundsteuern zu senken. In der letzten Legislativsitzung verabschiedete Senator Bettencourt mit 21 zu 9 Stimmen erfolgreich Senat Bill 2, das Texas Property Tax Reform and Transparency Act von 2019, um allen texanischen Steuerzahlern eine sinnvolle Grundsteuerreform und Erleichterungen zu bringen. Dies war die erste große Grundsteuerreform seit fast 40 Jahren und der Höhepunkt von zwei Jahrzehnten Lobbyarbeit. Er setzte auch seine Arbeit an adulten Stammzelltherapien in Texas fort, indem er HB 3148 sponserte und auf früheren Legislaturperioden aufbaute, um die Regierung aus dem Weg zu räumen, neue Therapien zu fördern und unheilbar und chronisch kranken Patienten Hoffnung auf eine bessere Lebensqualität zu geben. Seine Arbeit während der 86. Sitzung brachte ihm die Auszeichnung als „Senate MVP“ von Capitol Inside, „Bull of the Brazos“ von Texas Monthly, den Legislative Legacy Award der Texas Public Policy Foundation und den „Citizen’s Choice Award“ von Empower ein Texaner. Senator Bettencourt, ein Verfechter konservativer Lösungen für die Herausforderungen von Texas, hat sich im Kapitol einen guten Ruf aufgebaut, indem er sich für die Steuerzahler einsetzt. In seinen vorangegangenen Legislaturperioden arbeitete er unermüdlich daran, konservative Budgets zu verabschieden, eine Übermehrheitspflicht innerhalb einer Steuerhoheit zur Steuererhöhung zu erlassen (die eine Steuererhöhung von 100.000.000 USD im ersten Jahr verhinderte) sowie den Autor SB 7, der versuchte, das Wachstum auszumerzen Plage unangemessener Schüler-Lehrer-Beziehungen. Senator Bettencourt, ein mitfühlender Konservativer, war führend im „Recht auf Versuch“ und in der Gesetzgebung zu Stammzellen für Erwachsene und kämpfte dafür, dass unheilbar und chronisch kranke Patienten in ganz Texas einen besseren Zugang zu Behandlungen und neuen Therapien haben. Die von ihm gesponserte Gesetzgebung zu diesem wichtigen Thema wurde vom American Legislative Exchange Council als nationales Modell angenommen, dem andere Staaten folgen konnten. Er hat auch die dualen Kreditmöglichkeiten (SB 1004) für texanische Studenten und die gemeinsam verfasste überparteiliche Gesetzgebung stark erweitert, um die Bildungschancen für Studenten durch ISD/Charter-Partnerschaften (SB 1882) zu verbessern. Zahlreiche Organisationen haben Senator Bettencourt für seine Arbeit im Senat von Texas gewürdigt.

Die CDC hat zugegeben, dass Gesichtsmasken angesichts des zunehmenden Drucks, die Maskenmandate in den USA aufzuheben, wenig dazu beitragen, die Ausbreitung von COVID-19 zu verhindern. In einer neuen Studie stellte die CDC fest, dass Gesichtsmasken einen vernachlässigbaren Einfluss auf die Coronavirus-Zahlen hatten, die die statistischen Margen nicht überschritten des Fehlers. Die Studie ergab, dass zwischen März und Dezember 2020 die Bestellungen von Gesichtsmasken die Infektionsraten über die fortlaufenden Zeiträume von jeweils zwei Monaten um 1,5 Prozent reduzierten. Die Masken waren in den ersten 20 Tagen der Mandate zu 0,5 Prozent wirksam und nach 100 Tagen zu weniger als 2 Prozent wirksam. Die CDC fügte hinzu, dass sie weiterhin das Tragen von Gesichtsmasken empfiehlt, obwohl sie zugab, dass solche Mandate keinen statistischen Unterschied machen. In der Zwischenzeit sind einige Bundesstaaten im ganzen Land langsam zur Normalität zurückgekehrt, indem sie die Maskenpflichten beendet haben.	true
460156f1	Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOcasio-Cortez: Aktivisten haben demokratische Positionen zum Klima „tief beeinflusst“ Manchin-Schwimmer brechen Bidens Infrastrukturvorschlag auf David Sirota diskutiert den Kampf der Demokraten um die Aufhebung der SALT-Obergrenze Umfrage zeigt, dass das Weiße Haus hoffnungsvoll um 1 Prozentpunkt voraus ist. Eine am Donnerstagabend veröffentlichte Umfrage der USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times zeigt, dass Sanders mit 44 Prozent vor Clintons 43 Prozent führt. Der 1-Punkte-Vorsprung von Sanders liegt innerhalb der Fehlergrenze der Umfrage. Die Vorwahlen in Kalifornien stehen unabhängigen Wählern offen, die Sanders Auftrieb geben; Unter den registrierten Demokraten führt Clinton Sanders immer noch mit 4 Punkten Vorsprung, während Sanders 50 Prozent Unterstützung von Unabhängigen gegenüber Clintons 34 Prozent hat. Aber die Umfrage ergab, dass Clinton einen 10-Punkte-Vorsprung unter denjenigen hat, die wahrscheinlich nächste Woche wählen werden, hauptsächlich aufgrund der Unterstützung älterer Wähler. Sanders hat die Lücke zwischen ihm und Clinton weiter geschlossen und im ganzen Bundesstaat hart gekämpft. „Bernie Sanders hat in den letzten Wochen eine Quelle der Unterstützung in den demokratischen Vorwahlen angezapft und er schließt mit einem Ansturm“, sagte Dan Schnur, Direktor des Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics der USC, das mit der L.A. Times zusammenarbeitete die Umfrage. „Wenn es Clinton gelingt, ihn aufzuhalten und die Vorwahlen zu gewinnen, wäre das das Ergebnis einer geringen Wahlbeteiligung, die die Wählerschaft in ihre Richtung lenkt.“ Sanders hat in den letzten Wochen Kalifornien gestürmt, in der Hoffnung, einen großen Teil der 475 zugesagten Delegierten des Staates zu gewinnen. Wenn die Ergebnisse der Vorwahlen jedoch so nah beieinander liegen, wie jüngste Umfragen zeigen, würden Sanders und Clinton die 475 Delegierten gleichmäßig aufteilen, was dem Senator von Vermont bei seiner Suche nach der Nominierung keinen großen Auftrieb geben würde. Clinton führt Sanders in der zugesagten Delegiertenzahl von 1.769 bis 1.501 an. Wenn die Superdelegierten, die ungebundenen Parteiführer, die auf dem Juli-Kongress abstimmen, berücksichtigt werden, steigt der Vorsprung der ehemaligen First Lady auf 2.313 und bringt ihr nur 70 Delegierte hinter der demokratischen Nominierung zurück, so der Delegierten-Tracker von The Associated Press. Sanders hat versprochen, bis zum Parteitag der Demokraten zu kämpfen, um die Superdelegierten zum Umdrehen zu bewegen, und hofft, dass ein überzeugender Sieg in Kalifornien helfen wird. Die Umfrage der Los Angeles Times ist nur die neueste, die zeigt, dass es ein enges Rennen für die beiden demokratischen Kandidaten werden wird. Eine am Donnerstagmorgen veröffentlichte Field-Umfrage zeigte, dass Clinton unter den wahrscheinlichen demokratischen Primärwählern nur 2 Punkte, 45 Prozent zu 43 Prozent, vor Sanders liegt. Und eine am Mittwoch veröffentlichte NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist-Umfrage zeigt Clinton und Sanders in ähnlicher Weise innerhalb von 2 Punkten: Clinton führt Sanders in dieser Umfrage mit 49 Prozent zu 47 Prozent an. Die Umfrage der LA Times befragte vom 19. bis 31. Mai 1.500 Wähler und hat eine Fehlerquote von 2,9 Prozentpunkten. Dazu gehörten 903 demokratische Wähler mit einer Fehlerquote von 3,7 Prozentpunkten und 503 wahrscheinliche demokratische Wähler mit einer Fehlerquote von 5 Punkten.

fad64e2f	Die Obama-Regierung besteht darauf, dass es keine Gegenleistung gab, aber Kritiker beschuldigen die Zahlung eines Lösegelds. US-Außenminister John Kerry sprach mit iranischen Beamten, einschließlich seines Amtskollegen Javad Zarif, nachdem im Juli 2015 in Wien eine Einigung erzielt worden war. WASHINGTON – Die Obama-Regierung organisierte heimlich eine Luftbrücke im Wert von 400 Millionen Dollar in bar in den Iran, die mit dem Januar zusammenfiel Freilassung von vier in Teheran inhaftierten Amerikanern, so US- und europäische Beamte und Kongressmitarbeiter, die anschließend über die Operation informiert wurden. Laut diesen Beamten wurden Holzpaletten mit Euro, Schweizer Franken und anderen Währungen mit einem nicht gekennzeichneten Frachtflugzeug in den Iran geflogen. Die USA beschafften das Geld von den Zentralbanken der Niederlande und der Schweiz, hieß es. Das Geld stellte die erste Rate einer Einigung in Höhe von 1,7 Milliarden US-Dollar dar, die die Obama-Regierung mit dem Iran erzielt hatte, um einen jahrzehntealten Streit über ein gescheitertes Waffenabkommen beizulegen, das kurz vor dem Sturz des letzten iranischen Monarchen, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, im Jahr 1979 unterzeichnet wurde. Die Einigung, die Ansprüche vor einem internationalen Tribunal in Den Haag beilegte, fiel auch mit der formellen Umsetzung des wegweisenden Nuklearabkommens zusammen, das am selben Wochenende zwischen Teheran, den USA und anderen Weltmächten im Sommer zuvor geschlossen worden war. „Nachdem das Nuklearabkommen abgeschlossen und die Gefangenen freigelassen wurden, war die Zeit reif, auch diesen Streit beizulegen“, sagte Präsident Barack Obama am 17. Januar im Weißen Haus – ohne die Barzahlung in Höhe von 400 Millionen Dollar offenzulegen.	Die USA wiederholen sich als Weltmeister und schlagen die Niederlande mit 2:0	partially false
11aea5b0	Von Jim Francesconi Während wir die Governance-Fackel vom State Board of Higher Education an unabhängige Gremien der University of Oregon, der Portland State University und der Oregon State University weitergeben, werden wir in eine Zukunft mit erhöhten Risiken und Belohnungen navigieren. Die Belohnung liegt in der Verstärkung des Privatsektors, der unseren drei großen Forschungsuniversitäten zu Hilfe kommt. Das Kaliber einiger Vorstandskandidaten ähnelt dem an Stanford, Yale, Harvard und anderen angesehenen Privatuniversitäten. Bedeutende CEOs und Unternehmer aus Oregon haben sich bereit erklärt, ihre Macht, ihren Einfluss und ihre Ressourcen zum Nutzen der öffentlichen Universitäten von Oregon einzusetzen. Oregon ist ein kleiner Staat mit begrenzten öffentlichen Ressourcen, großen Bedürfnissen und hohen Ambitionen. Obwohl unsere Universitäten einige der besten Programme des Landes haben, werden wir unserem Potenzial nicht gerecht. Das passiert, wenn die staatliche Finanzierung für mehr als 20 Jahre in der Nähe des unteren Endes aller Staaten versinkt. Jetzt gibt es das Versprechen, private Ressourcen für diesen lebenswichtigen öffentlichen Zweck einzusetzen. Aber es gibt auch Risiken. Wir brauchen hochwertige Ingenieur- und andere Forschungsprogramme, aber wir können sie uns nicht an jedem Campus leisten. Portland muss versorgt werden, wobei die PSU zuständig ist, aber das gilt auch für jeden Teil unseres Bundesstaates. Unsere kleinen Schulen sollten gestärkt und nicht geopfert werden. Sport ist wichtig, aber nicht die höchste Priorität. So wichtig Universitäten auch sind, sie sind Mittel für öffentliche Zwecke, nicht Selbstzweck. Oregon braucht eine lebendige, innovative Wirtschaft. Unsere Universitäten können mehr Forschungskooperationen wie ONAMI (Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute) und das Portland Life Sciences Center schaffen, die erstklassige Talente anziehen und Arbeitsplätze schaffen. Als nächstes … das Light Metals Institute, das von den Universitäten Oregon und Washington und der Unternehmenskoalition Manufacturing 21 gesponsert wird. Oregons Pro-Kopf-Einkommen liegt fast 10 Prozent unter dem nationalen Durchschnitt. Universitäten können mehr Oregonianer auf gut bezahlte Jobs im Gesundheitswesen, in MINT-Fächern (Wissenschaft, Technologie, Ingenieurwesen, Mathematik), in fortgeschrittener Fertigung und in beruflich-technischen Karrieren vorbereiten. Und wir sollten die wachsende demografische und politische Stärke der Latino-Gemeinschaft nutzen, indem wir zusammenarbeiten, um den Zugang zum College und zu von der Familie bezahlten Jobs zu ermöglichen. Vor allem muss Oregon zeigen, dass Arbeiter und arme Leute es in Amerika noch schaffen können. Bildung nach der High School ist der Weg, aber für viele Kinder unerreichbar, besonders im ländlichen Oregon. Fast die Hälfte der Kinder in Oregon sind arm. Die Hälfte der Studenten der Oregon University erhält Pell Grants. Die durchschnittliche Studentenverschuldung beträgt mehr als 25.000 US-Dollar. Infolgedessen gehen weniger Oregonianer aufs College. Wie viele andere haben auch meine Großeltern und Eltern Opfer gebracht, damit ich der Erste in meiner Familie sein konnte, der aufs College gehen konnte. Zum ersten Mal in der Geschichte Oregons ist meine Generation besser ausgebildet als die Generation, die jetzt im College-Alter ist. Neue Mitglieder des Universitätsvorstands können Stipendienmittel aufbringen, damit mehr Oregoner einen Abschluss an der UO, PSU und OSU machen können. Aber diese Vorstandsmitglieder sollten auch dazu beitragen, die Philanthropie am Southern, Western, Eastern und am Oregon Institute of Technology zu steigern. Alle Oregoner aus allen Teilen des Bundesstaates sollten die Möglichkeit haben, ihr Potenzial auszuschöpfen und zu unserem Bundesstaat beizutragen. Schließlich müssen wir verstehen, dass Philanthropie allein keine hervorragenden Universitäten mit innovativer Forschung, qualitativ hochwertiger Lehre und Zugang für alle Einwohner von Oregon hervorbringen kann. Die gesetzgebende Körperschaft hat das Budget konsequent auf dem Rücken der Studenten ausgeglichen, wodurch Studiengebührenerhöhungen erzwungen wurden. Neue Vorstandsmitglieder haben die Macht, diese Praxis umzukehren und große öffentliche Investitionen in unsere Universitäten zum Wohle Oregons zu erzwingen. Lassen Sie uns zusammenarbeiten, um diese Kraft für den Aufbau eines erschwinglichen und zugänglichen Universitätssystems von Weltklasse einzusetzen. Jim Francesconi ist Mitglied des State Board of Higher Education und lebt im Nordosten von Portland.

9d3ac1f0	Drei von vier Arbeitsstationen haben über Nacht keine Berater. Ein heute veröffentlichtes großes Audit zeigt auch, dass es fast der Hälfte der Krankenhäuser am Wochenende an leitenden Spezialisten mangelt. Und laut dem Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists war nur in zwei von 165 Entbindungsstationen rund um die Uhr ein Berater anwesend. Scrollen Sie nach unten für das Video Eine heute veröffentlichte große Prüfung zeigt auch, dass es fast der Hälfte der Krankenhäuser am Wochenende an leitenden Spezialisten mangelt. Stock Bild Werdende Mütter werden stattdessen überforderten Hebammen und unerfahrenen und oft erschöpften Nachwuchsärzten überlassen. Obwohl die Berater von zu Hause aus auf Abruf sind, können sie bis zu 30 Minuten entfernt wohnen, und die Mitarbeiter rufen sie nur in Notfällen herbei. Mehr als die Hälfte der Geburten finden außerhalb der Geschäftszeiten statt. Und die Forschung zeigt, dass Babys, die zu diesem Zeitpunkt geboren wurden, ein Drittel häufiger sterben oder ernsthafte Komplikationen erleiden. Das Royal College erhielt die Zahlen von 165 NHS-Entbindungsstationen – 82 Prozent der Gesamtzahl. Sie zeigen Folgendes: Knapp über 73 Prozent hatten keine Berater in der Nachtschicht an Wochentagen, typischerweise von 22.00 bis 8.00 Uhr; Weitere 43 Prozent gaben an, dass am Wochenende niemand vor Ort sei; 89 Prozent gaben an, dass Berater am Wochenende nicht in der Spätschicht anwesend waren; Das Heart of England NHS Trust in Birmingham und die Central Manchester University waren die einzigen Zentren mit Beratern Tag und Nacht, die ganze Woche über. Maureen Treadwell von der Birth Trauma Association sagte: „Wir sind besorgt über die Anzahl der Krankenhaus-Trusts, die nachts keine Beraterabdeckung haben. „Es gibt eine Reihe seltener, aber plötzlicher katastrophaler Ereignisse während der Wehen, bei denen ein weniger erfahrener Arzt möglicherweise den Rat oder die Unterstützung eines erfahrenen Kollegen benötigt. „Dies sind keine gewöhnlichen Ereignisse, aber jedes Jahr sterben einige Frauen und Babys an den Folgen mangelhafter Pflege, oft von Mitarbeitern, die ihr Bestes geben, aber vielleicht nie mit einer solchen Erkrankung fertig geworden sind.“ Die Zahlen sind besorgniserregend, weil die Geburten es sind aufgrund von Fettleibigkeit und dem Trend, dass Frauen später Kinder bekommen, immer komplexer werden. Experten sagen, dass Hebammen und Ärzte in der Ausbildung seltener erkennen, wenn etwas schief geht, und zögern, die Hilfe von Beratern in Anspruch zu nehmen. Auch die Arbeitsstationen stehen aufgrund hoher Geburtenraten aufgrund der Migration unter Druck. Jonathan Ashworth, Gesundheitssprecher von Labour, sagte, es zeige, dass die Tories nicht einmal einen fünftägigen NHS liefern können alle, die sie nutzen – Tag und Nacht. „Die Tories sprechen von einem siebentägigen NHS, aber diese Zahlen zeigen, dass sie nicht einmal einen fünftägigen NHS liefern können.“ Elizabeth Duff vom National Childbirth Trust sagte: „Frauen brauchen bei jeder Geburt sichere Mutterschaftsdienste. Wir wissen, dass mehr getan werden muss, um das richtige Personal bereitzustellen, um bei Bedarf Unterstützung zu leisten.“ Das Royal College gab 2009 Empfehlungen heraus, wonach Entbindungsstationen darauf hinarbeiten sollten, dass Berater rund um die Uhr anwesend sind. Dadurch würden die Betreuung von Frauen und die Ausbildung von Nachwuchskräften verbessert, heißt es in den Leitlinien. Fachärzte sollen die Versorgung aller Patientinnen in Entbindungsstationen überwachen und eingreifen, wenn etwas schief geht. Eine große Studie des Imperial College London aus dem letzten Jahr ergab, dass Babys, die am Wochenende geboren wurden, mit 7 Prozent höherer Wahrscheinlichkeit tot geboren wurden. Und eine von der Cambridge University im Jahr 2010 veröffentlichte Studie ergab, dass Babys, die über Nacht oder am Wochenende in schottischen Krankenhäusern geboren wurden, ein Drittel häufiger starben. MEIN BABY WÜRDE HEUTE LEBEN, WENN ICH SIE IN DER WOCHE HÄTTE Angela Owens mit Baby abgebildet Hope glaubt, dass ihre Tochter Ella heute leben würde, wenn sie an einem Wochentag geboren hätte Angela Owens glaubt, dass ihre Tochter Ella heute leben würde, wenn sie geboren hätte an einem Wochentag. Sie war zwei Wochen überfällig, als sie vier Tage vor Weihnachten 2013 an einem Samstagnachmittag starke und plötzliche Schmerzen verspürte. Die 31-Jährige ging auf die Arbeitsstation des Warrington Hospital und beschrieb es als eine Geisterstadt. Hebammen sagten ihr immer wieder, sie solle nach Hause gehen und Paracetamol nehmen – und ignorierten ihre Bitten um eine Fachärztin. Schließlich – nachdem ihr GP-Bruder angekommen war – piepsten sie den Berater, aber zu diesem Zeitpunkt war es zu spät. Als Ella schließlich am Samstag um 23 Uhr auf die Welt kam, wurde sie tot geboren. Die Mutter, die mit ihrem Partner Paul zwei weitere Töchter hat, sagte: „Es gab eine allgemeine leichtsinnige Haltung mir gegenüber.“ „Man hat in diesen Situationen auf das Gesundheitspersonal vertraut, aber ich musste sie um Hilfe bitten. „Krankenhäuser scheinen an den Wochenenden in den Schlafmodus zu gehen, und für uns führte dies zur ultimativen Tragödie. Es war entsetzlich. Ich werde mich nie von ihrem Tod erholen.“ Ella war eines von zehn Babys, die in einem Zeitraum von 12 Monaten zwischen 2013/14 tot geboren wurden oder unter ungeklärten Umständen im Warrington Hospital starben. Die Todesfälle waren vermeidbar und wurden auf Personalmangel zurückgeführt – die Hälfte ereignete sich an Wochenenden. Die Autoren sagten, dass das Gleiche für englische Krankenhäuser gelten würde. Sie machten die zusätzlichen Risiken auf mangelndes Eingreifen von Nachwuchsärzten zurückzuführen. NHS-Zahlen zeigen, dass Ärzte 2014/15 fast 40 Prozent der Geburten durchgeführt haben und Hebammen den größten Teil des Rests. Sie geben nicht an, ob erstere Fachärzte oder Assistenzärzte waren. Aber die Zahl ist von 24 Prozent im Jahr 1989 stetig gestiegen.Ein Sprecher von NHS England sagte: „Ein Baby zu bekommen ist jetzt sicherer als je zuvor, und die überwiegende Mehrheit der Mütter berichtet, dass sie eine großartige NHS-Mutterschaftsversorgung erhalten.“ Der Sprecher hob hervor Eine Studie aus dem letzten Jahr, die behauptete, es gebe keine Beweise dafür, dass Berater über Nacht einen Unterschied in der Sicherheit machten. Aber er weigerte sich, andere Forschungsergebnisse anzuerkennen, die zeigten, dass Babys, die außerhalb der Arbeitszeit geboren wurden, mit größerer Wahrscheinlichkeit starben. Morgen wird der NHS seine allerersten Bewertungen im Ofsted-Stil für die Mutterschaftspflege veröffentlichen, um die Standards zu erhöhen.	„Es werden nicht nur Sanktionen sein“: Biden-Berater droht, Russland mit „gesehenen und unsichtbaren Werkzeugen“ für den SolarWinds-Hack zu bestrafen	true
645808de	Rainsys Verurteilung eine „rechtliche Angelegenheit, keine politische“. Ein außerhalb von Kambodscha aufgenommenes Bild von Sam Rainsy C, L und den sieben anderen ehemaligen CNRP-Abgeordneten, die wegen des Putschversuchs verurteilt wurden. Regierungsbeamte von Facebook haben die Verurteilung des ehemaligen Oppositionsführers Sam Rainsy und acht weiterer hochrangiger Beamter wegen eines Komplotts zum Sturz der Regierung vor dem Stadtgericht von Phnom Penh verteidigt. Der Sprecher des Justizministeriums, Chin Malin, sagte gestern, dass die Entscheidung des Gerichts gegen ehemalige Oppositionsführer im Einklang mit dem Gesetz getroffen worden sei, und sagte, das Gericht habe genug Argumente, um sie strafrechtlich zu verfolgen. „Noch wichtiger ist, dass die Behörden in Übereinstimmung mit den gesetzlichen Verfahren gehandelt haben und die Gerichte den Prozess auf der Grundlage des Verfahrens geführt und Entscheidungen auf der Grundlage der Tatsachen und bestehenden rechtlichen Aspekte getroffen haben“, sagte er. Der vorsitzende Richter Duch Sok Sarin verurteilte am Montag den im Exil lebenden Rainsy zu 25 Jahren Gefängnis, während Mu Sochua und Eng Chhai Eang, beide Vizepräsidenten und ehemalige Gesetzgeber der Ex-CNRP, zu 22 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt wurden jeder. Der Richter verurteilte außerdem sechs weitere ehemalige CNRP-Gesetzgeber zu jeweils 20 Jahren Gefängnis, nachdem sie für schuldig befunden worden waren, versucht zu haben, die Regierung „anzugreifen“. Sie sind Rainsys Frau Tioulong Saumura, Ou Chanrith, Ho Vann, Long Ry, Men Thavarin und Nuth Romduol. Alle leben im Exil im Ausland. Den Verurteilten wurde das Wahl- und Wahlrecht entzogen. Rainsy schwor, am 9. November 2019 in das Königreich zurückzukehren, um Demokratie und Menschenrechte wiederherzustellen, aber seine geplante Rückkehr kam nicht zustande. Die Regierung beschuldigte ihn und seine Verbündeten jedoch, einen Putsch geplant zu haben. In seiner Erklärung zur Verurteilung sagte Rainsy, es sei einfach eine „politische Erklärung“, die aus Schwäche und Angst geboren wurde. „Der kambodschanische Premierminister Hun Sen befürchtet das Risiko meiner Rückkehr auf die kambodschanische politische Bühne. Er fürchtet auch die Aussicht auf freie und faire Wahlen, die unweigerlich zum Ende seines derzeitigen autokratischen und anachronistischen Regimes führen würden“, sagte er. Rainsy behauptete, Herr Hun Sen habe sich wiederholt geweigert, ihm und anderen führenden Persönlichkeiten des Ex-CNRP die Rückkehr nach Kambodscha zu gestatten, und sagte, das Urteil sei lediglich dazu gedacht, Ex-CNRP-Anhänger im Land einzuschüchtern. Malin sagte jedoch, dass ehemalige CNRP-Führer ihr Fehlverhalten nie eingestanden hätten. „Es ist normal, dass sie ihre Fehler nie zugeben. Als Rechtfertigung gibt der Täter niemals zu, dass er ein Verbrechen begangen hat“, fügte Malin hinzu. In ihrer Erklärung beschrieb die gerichtlich aufgelöste CNRP das Urteil wie folgt: „Kambodschas politisiertes Gericht bestätigt den Putsch und die Abschaffung der Demokratie“. Es sagte, es bestreite vollständig alle Vorwürfe und weise das Urteil entschieden zurück. Es fügte hinzu, dass 130 Mitglieder der Ex-CNRP im vergangenen Jahr in Untersuchungshaft gehalten und als Komplizen der neun CNRP-Führer angeklagt wurden. „Die internationale Gemeinschaft muss auf diese unerträglichen Entwicklungen ebenso entschlossen reagieren“, fügte sie hinzu. „Diese Urteile müssen angeprangert, verworfen und schließlich zurückgenommen werden.“ Die US-Botschaft in Phnom Penh sagte gestern, sie sei beunruhigt über die Urteile, die gegen die neun kambodschanischen politischen Oppositionsführer verhängt wurden, darunter einige, die auch amerikanische Staatsbürger sind. „Diese Urteile sind Teil einer Reihe von Massenprozessen gegen mehr als 130 Unterstützer der politischen Opposition und Aktivisten der Zivilgesellschaft, denen ein grundlegendes ordnungsgemäßes Verfahren fehlt“, hieß es. „Wir fordern die Regierung von Kambodscha nachdrücklich auf, die Meinungs- und Vereinigungsfreiheit zu schützen, wie sie in der Verfassung des Landes verankert ist, und fordern die Behörden auf, im Vorfeld der Kommunalwahlen 2022 und der nationalen Wahlen 2023 sinnvolle Schritte zu unternehmen, um den bürgerlichen und politischen Raum wieder zu öffnen “, fügte es hinzu. Der Sprecher der kambodschanischen Volkspartei, Sok Eysan, sagte jedoch gestern, dass die Verurteilung dazu führen werde, dass ehemalige CNRP-Führer nicht mehr an den Kommunal- und Nationalwahlen 2022 und 2023 teilnehmen und daran teilnehmen können. Er sagte, das politische Leben der ehemaligen CNRP-Führer sei wegen ihrer schlechten Absichten gegen das Volk und die Nation zu Ende gegangen. „Der Fall ist eine juristische Angelegenheit, keine politische.“	Warum Wissenschaftler über die globale Erwärmung uneins sind Der NIPCC-Bericht über den wissenschaftlichen Konsens	false
80c02218	"Der abgebildete Sajid Javid stand letzte Nacht vor einer totalen Revolte über die Geschäftstarife. Theresa May hat weiterhin „volles Vertrauen“ in den Gemeindesekretär Sajid Javid, obwohl er mit einer umfassenden Revolte über die Geschäftstarife konfrontiert ist. Der umkämpfte Kabinettsminister hat darauf bestanden, dass Kritiker der Neubewertung der Unternehmenszinsen durch eine „unerbittliche Kampagne von Verzerrungen und Halbwahrheiten“ in die Irre geführt wurden. Aber Herr Javid sieht sich mit Behauptungen von Tory-Kollegen konfrontiert, dass er „die Zahlen dreht“, und ein Brief, der gesendet wurde, um die Reihe zu beruhigen, spielte die Anstiege herunter. Als der Streit überzukochen drohte, wurde der offizielle Sprecher von Frau May gefragt, ob der Premierminister weiterhin volles Vertrauen in Herrn Javid habe. Er antwortete: 'Ja.' Die Regierung besteht darauf, dass 73 Prozent der Unternehmen die gleichen Sätze oder niedrigere Rechnungen haben werden – aber dadurch müssen 510.000 Unternehmen mit höheren Gebühren konfrontiert werden. In einem Brief bat Herr Javid die Abgeordneten, ihre Wähler in Bezug auf die Änderungen zu beruhigen, und argumentierte, dass drei Viertel der Unternehmen ihre Zinsen einfrieren oder senken werden. Aber letzte Nacht wurde Herr Javid beschuldigt, selbst mit Fehlinformationen hausiert zu haben, als eine neue Analyse darauf hinwies, dass die Zahlen der Regierung ungenau waren. Die Studie besagt, dass die Rechnungen, die Unternehmen in den nächsten Wochen tatsächlich erhalten werden, im Durchschnitt 7 Prozentpunkte höher sein werden, als die Minister sagen. Dies liegt daran, dass eine Inflation von 2 Prozent nicht eingerechnet wurde und die Regierung davon ausgegangen ist, dass ihr Berufungssystem allen Unternehmen 5 Prozent Rabatt gewähren wird – obwohl Herausforderungen schwieriger und kostspieliger zu bewältigen sind. Ex-Minister Grant Shapps beschuldigte heute Herrn Javid, „die Zahlen zu verdrehen“. Er sagte gegenüber Sky News: „Die Regierung hat vorgeschlagen, dass dies steuerlich neutral ist, aber 1 Milliarde Pfund einbringt. ""Besser, das einfach zu sagen, anstatt es als etwas auszuspinnen, das Unternehmen tatsächlich Geld spart, wenn dies nicht der Fall ist."" Ex-Minister Grant Shapps beschuldigte heute Herrn Javid, die Zahlen in der Reihe über eine Neubewertung der Geschäftszinsen zu verdrehen. „Ich bin enttäuscht, dass die Zahlen, die wir erhalten haben, den Anschein erwecken, als würden sie nicht die tatsächliche Lage wiedergeben“, sagte er. „Die Liste enthält ein Best-Case-Szenario. Ich habe den Bundeskanzler darauf angesprochen, aber keine Antwort erhalten.' In Herrn Javids Brief – ebenfalls unterzeichnet vom Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke – hieß es, dass die Tarife in 250 der 329 lokalen Abrechnungsbehörden in England sinken würden – und führte diese in einer dem Brief beigefügten Liste auf. Laut einer Analyse des Rating-Spezialisten Gerald Eve werden die Zinsen nur in 135 Gemeinden sinken – und in 191 steigen. Basildon, Harrogate, Canterbury und Stafford gehören zu den 124 lokalen Behörden, die für eine allgemeine Erhöhung der Unternehmenszinsen im Gegensatz zu der Senkung anstehen von der Regierung versprochen. Basildon wird sehen, dass die Geschäftsraten um 0,15 Prozent steigen, anstatt um 6,3 Prozent zu fallen. Harrogate wird einen Anstieg um 2,27 Prozent erleben, im Gegensatz zu einer Kürzung um 4,3 Prozent, und Canterbury wird einen Anstieg um 0,92 Prozent statt eines Rückgangs um 4,3 Prozent erleben. Der Gemeindeminister behauptet, kleine Unternehmen seien durch eine „unerbittliche Kampagne von Verzerrungen und Halbwahrheiten“ in die Irre geführt worden. Die Analyse besagt, dass der Wahlkreis Maidenhead von Theresa May einen Anstieg der Unternehmenssteuersätze um 15,75 Prozent sehen wird – statt eines Anstiegs um 8,3 Prozent, der in der Liste behauptet wird dem Schreiben von Herrn Javid beigefügt. Gleichzeitig wird der Rückgang der Zinsen im Wahlkreis Bromsgrove von Herrn Javid nur 9,29 Prozent betragen – im Gegensatz zu der Zahl der Regierung von 15,2 Prozent, sagte Jerry Schurder, Leiter der Geschäftsraten bei Gerald Eve, gestern Abend: „Die bereitgestellten Zahlen gegenüber Tory-Abgeordneten zeigen, dass das Ministerium für Gemeinschaften in einem Paralleluniversum lebt, in dem es keine Inflation und ein automatisiertes Berufungssystem gibt, das 5 Prozent Rabatte auf der ganzen Linie gewährt. Theresa May, die gestern im Wahlkampf bei den Nachwahlen in Stoke abgebildet war, vertraut Sajid Javid trotz der Aufregung über die Zinsen für Unternehmen 7 Prozent höher als diese Zahlen vermuten lassen, während Rechtsmittel sowohl teurer als auch erfolgloser werden, da die Regierung versucht, Unternehmen davon abzuhalten, ihre Rechnungen anzufechten.' Das Ministerium für Gemeinschaften und Kommunalverwaltung wies gestern Abend Behauptungen zurück, dass die Zahlen irreführend seien. Sie verwies die Mail auf das Kleingedruckte, in dem es heißt: „Die durchschnittliche Änderung der Rechnungen ist, bevor Inflations- oder Berufungsanpassungen vorgenommen wurden.“ Tim Farron, der Führer der Liberaldemokraten, sagte: „Sajid Javid hat sich über Halbwahrheiten beschwert und dann bringt er diesen Quatsch heraus. Diese Zahlen sind reine Fehlinformationen und Halbwahrheiten. Die Regierung sollte sich schämen. Sie drehen sich so sehr um dieses Thema, dass sie allen schwindelig machen. „Während sie unsere Daten mit Fehlern übersäten, geraten kleine Unternehmen angesichts der Auswirkungen dieser massiven Zinserhöhungen in Panik. Es ist Zeit für eine Kehrtwende. Die Regierung muss es bald schaffen.' Herr Javid wurde auch von Unternehmensgruppen, Abgeordneten und kleinen Firmen unter Beschuss genommen, die behaupteten, er habe in seinem Brief auch wichtige Informationen über die verheerenden Auswirkungen von Ratensteigerungen weggelassen. Das Institute of Directors beschrieb Herrn Javids Versäumnis, die halbe Million Unternehmen zu erwähnen, deren Zinssätze steigen werden, als „unaufrichtig“ und warnte, dass „Zehntausende“ pleite gehen könnten. Stephen Herring, Leiter der Steuerabteilung des IoD, sagte: „Die Regierung hat Recht, dass viele Unternehmen ihre Steuersätze sinken sehen werden, aber das Problem sind die plötzlichen und dramatischen Erhöhungen, mit denen viele Geschäfte und Pubs in der Hauptstraße fertig werden müssen. Es ist unaufrichtig, sich auf durchschnittliche Zinssenkungen zu konzentrieren und die Tatsache zu ignorieren, dass viele kleine Unternehmen mit enormen Zinserhöhungen konfrontiert sind. Wir könnten sehen, wie Zehntausende von Firmen pleite gehen.' Das British Retail Consortium sagte in einer Erklärung: „Niemand ist ein Gewinner dieser Neubewertung. Die Tarife für Unternehmen sind von einem Drittel des Mietwerts im Jahr 1990 auf die Hälfte heute gestiegen. Amanda Wrigley und ihre Mutter Shirley vor ihrem Geschäft Hirst Antiques in Notting Hill, das vor einer großen Erhöhung der Gewerbesteuersätze steht „Dies ist die höchste gewerbliche Grundsteuer in der entwickelten Welt. Das derzeitige System ist für das 21. Jahrhundert nicht geeignet und bedarf einer grundlegenden Reform.“ Ein Antiquitätenhändler sagte, die Zinserhöhung könnte der „letzte Nagel im Sarg“ für viele angeschlagene High Street-Einzelhändler sein. Amanda Wrigley leitet Hirst Antiques in Notting Hill, London, zusammen mit ihrer Mutter Shirley Hirst, die das Unternehmen vor 53 Jahren gegründet hat. Miss Wrigley, 36, sagte, ihre Raten würden sich verdoppeln, während Ketten mit viel geringeren Erhöhungen konfrontiert seien. Sie sagte der Mail: „Das ist kein Mythos. Wir erfinden das nicht. Das wirkt sich auf das Geschäft im ganzen Land aus. Viele von uns spüren bereits die Prise – aber dies könnte der letzte Nagel im Sarg sein. „Meine Mutter arbeitet mit 80 Jahren immer noch und hat Spaß an dem, was sie tut. Aber es macht viel weniger Spaß, wenn zuerst unsere Miete und dann unsere Preise steigen. Wir fragen uns, wie wir es zum Laufen bringen werden.' Gestern sagte ein anderer Rating-Spezialist, Herr Javid habe auch nicht erwähnt, dass Tausende von Unternehmen, die für die größten Senkungen der Geschäftszinsen anstehen, aufgrund von Übergangsregelungen jahrelang nicht von der vollen Senkung profitieren werden. Eine Analyse des Ratingspezialisten Daniel Watney ergab, dass die Hälfte der Unternehmen, die auf die größten Zinssenkungen eingestellt sind, drei Jahre lang nicht die volle Senkung erhalten werden – und eines von fünf wird den vollen Nutzen überhaupt nicht sehen, bevor die Zinsen in fünf Jahren erneut neu bewertet werden. Ein Regierungssprecher sagte: „Dies sind völlig falsche Behauptungen von Ratingagenten, die mehr an ihren eigenen Gewinnen interessiert sind als an einem fairen Geschäft für Unternehmen. „Wir haben deutlich gemacht, wie unsere Zahlen berechnet werden und was sie beinhalten. Tatsächlich bedeutet die Neubewertung der Geschäftstarife, dass drei Viertel der Unternehmen einen Rückgang oder keine Änderung ihrer Rechnungen feststellen werden – 600.000 kleine Unternehmen zahlen überhaupt keine Tarife. ""Unsere Reformen hindern niemanden daran, Einspruch gegen seine Rechnungen einzulegen oder legen eine Fehlermarge fest. Unsere Reformen werden dazu führen, dass Unternehmen diese angsteinflößenden Ratingagenturen nicht mehr durchlaufen müssen, sondern ihre Rechnungen schnell und einfach prüfen, anfechten und anfechten können."" Entlarvt: Forderungserhöhungen des Ministers sind ein Mythos Eine Analyse des Wirtschaftskorrespondenten James Salmon Sajid Javid hat direkt an die Abgeordneten geschrieben, um zu versuchen, die Rebellion gegen seine Zinsreformen zu unterdrücken. Der Gemeindesekretär bestand darauf, dass der Streit auf „Mythen“ beruhe. Aber Geschäftsgruppen beschuldigten ihn gestern Abend, selbst mit Halbwahrheiten hausieren zu gehen. JAVIDS BEHAUPTUNG Er sagt, der erste „Mythos“ über die Neubewertung sei, dass es „allgemeine Zinserhöhungen“ geben werde. WIRKLICHKEIT Niemand hat behauptet, dass die Geschäftsraten der meisten Unternehmen steigen werden. Herr Javid weist darauf hin, dass die Neubewertung etwa 600.000 kleinere Unternehmen aus der Zahlung von Geschäftstarifen befreien wird, während etwa 740.000 ihre Tarife eingefroren werden. Aber es gibt keine Erwähnung von Zahlen der Regierung, die zeigen, dass etwa eine halbe Million Unternehmen eine Erhöhung ihrer Raten von bis zu 300 Prozent erleben werden. Der Minister begrüßt auch das „beispiellose Zinserleichterungspaket in Höhe von 6,7 Milliarden Pfund“, um sicherzustellen, dass diejenigen, die mit den größten Zinserhöhungen konfrontiert sind, diese schrittweise einführen. Was Herr Javid jedoch nicht sagt, ist, dass die Unternehmen, die auf Kürzungen vorbereitet waren, jahrelang nicht in den vollen Genuss der Vorteile kommen werden. Eine „Abwärtsobergrenze“ für Steuersenkungen bedeutet, dass kleine Unternehmen ihre Steuersätze 2017/18 um maximal 20 Prozent senken können. Diese Obergrenzen sind für mittlere und größere Unternehmen sogar noch strenger – sie erhalten im ersten Jahr der neuen Regelung einen maximalen Rabatt von 4,1 Prozent. Die Erleichterungen kommen wahrscheinlich zu spät für die Tausenden von Unternehmen, die bereits über die Quoten zahlen, da die letzte Neubewertung auf dem Höhepunkt des Immobilienbooms vor der Kreditkrise im Jahr 2008 durchgeführt wurde. Laut dem Experten für Geschäftsraten, Daniel Watney, die Hälfte der Immobilien Unternehmen, die die größten Zinsrückgänge sehen, werden drei Jahre lang nicht von ihrer vollständigen Zinssenkung profitieren, während jeder Fünfte seine vollständige Zinssenkung nicht vor der nächsten Neubewertung in fünf Jahren erleben wird. CLAIM Revaluation wird „nachdrücklich nicht dazu benutzt, eine heimliche Steuererhöhung zu verbergen“. WIRKLICHKEIT Zahlen der Regierung deuten darauf hin, dass die Neubewertung allein im ersten Jahr eine zusätzliche Milliarde Pfund einbringen wird. Die Geschäftstarife werden 2017-18 25,5 Mrd. £ erhöhen, nachdem die Änderungen am 1. April eingeführt wurden, gegenüber 24,5 Mrd. £ in diesem Jahr. Herr Javid hat darauf bestanden, dass dies einfach darauf zurückzuführen ist, dass die Zahl der Unternehmen voraussichtlich wachsen wird, da einige Räumlichkeiten erweitert oder renoviert werden. Das bedeutet, dass mehr und größere Unternehmen in den Topf einzahlen werden. Aber das British Retail Consortium und das Institute of Directors befürchten beide, dass die Reformen viele Händler an die Wand treiben werden, was bedeutet, dass jede Steigerung der Einnahmen für die Staatskasse von Unternehmen kommen muss, die mehr zahlen. Behauptungen, dass die Preisüberprüfung Hauptstraßen verwüsten wird, sind „einfach nicht wahr“. Realität Wieder scheint Herr Javid Warnungen von Wirtschaftsführern absichtlich falsch interpretiert oder ignoriert zu haben. Lobbygruppen – darunter das Institute of Directors und das British Retail Consortium – haben nie angedeutet, dass Hunderttausende von Unternehmen pleite gehen werden. Angesichts der Tatsache, dass die Preise von mehr als einer halben Million Unternehmen um 300 Prozent in die Höhe schießen werden, glaubt das IoD, dass Zehntausende von Pubs und Restaurants, die bereits Probleme haben, über den Rand gekippt werden. Die Einzelhandelsexpertin Mary Portas hat davor gewarnt, dass die Neubewertung High Street-Läden in Gebieten, in denen die Immobilienpreise gestiegen sind, „lähmen“ wird. „Das Steuergesetz, das die Einzelhändler ab April treffen wird, wird der größte Schlag für unabhängige Geschäfte seit der Finanzkrise sein“, sagte sie. ""Ich würde schätzen, dass mindestens ein Drittel von ihnen sterben wird."" ANSPRUCH Die Regierung „reformiert das Berufungsverfahren, um es den Unternehmen zu erleichtern, ihre Rechnungen zu prüfen, anzufechten und Berufung einzulegen“. REALITÄT Es wird schwieriger und teurer für Unternehmen, Berufung einzulegen, sobald eine Beschwerde vom Bewertungsgericht der Regierung abgewiesen wurde. Was Herr Javid in seinem Schreiben nicht erwähnt, ist, dass die Regierung neue Gebühren in Höhe von 150 £ für kleine Unternehmen einführt, nur um ihren Satz vor einem Gericht anzufechten. Größere Unternehmen müssen 300 £ zahlen. Die Regierung plant außerdem, Unternehmen mit einer Geldstrafe von bis zu 500 £ zu belegen, wenn sie beim Ausfüllen ihrer Formulare einen „fahrlässigen“ oder absichtlichen Fehler machen. Beamte behaupten, es werde Unternehmen davon abhalten, spekulative Berufungen einzureichen, die mit wenig oder keinen Beweisen gestützt werden. Dies sollte dazu beitragen, einen Rückstand von 280.000 Beschwerdefällen aufzulösen, der bis ins Jahr 2010 zurückreicht. Es wurden jedoch auch mehrere andere Änderungen am Beschwerdeverfahren vorgenommen, die es den Unternehmen erschweren werden, sich zu beschweren. Bisher war es ein zweistufiger Prozess mit einem einfachen Formular und es wurden keine Gebühren erhoben. Jetzt wird erwartet, dass es sich um einen dreistufigen Prozess handelt, einschließlich einer anfänglichen „Prüfphase“, in der Unternehmen bestätigen müssen, dass jeder Teil ihres Eigentums, auf dem die Bewertung basiert, korrekt ist. Experten sagen, dass Unternehmen auch mehr formelle Nachweise als bisher vorlegen müssen. Wenn über die Beschwerde noch immer nicht entschieden wurde, ist die letzte Stufe ein Schiedsgericht, bei dem eine Gebühr erhoben wird."

7043de09	"Die Regierung von Theresa May steht unter Druck, Behauptungen zu erklären, sie habe es versäumt, den Brandschutz in Gebäuden zu verbessern, obwohl vor möglichen Tragödien wie der im Hochhaus Grenfell House gewarnt wurde. Gavin Barwell, der neue Stabschef des Premierministers, hat es versäumt, während seiner Amtszeit als Wohnungsminister grünes Licht für eine Sicherheitsüberprüfung zu geben, obwohl sich diese bereits um Jahre verzögert hatte. Sein Vorgänger als Wohnungsbauminister Brandon Lewis lehnte es ab, eine Verordnung einzuführen, die die Entwickler zum Einbau von Sprinkleranlagen zwingt, weil er sagte, dass dies nicht in der Verantwortung der Regierung liege. Jeremy Corbyn erhöhte den Druck, indem er forderte, dass Herr Barwell und andere, die auf Forderungen nach einer Sicherheitsüberprüfung nicht reagiert hatten, befragt werden sollten. Empfohlene Theresa May verspricht, die Katastrophe im Grenfell Tower zu untersuchen Theresa May ordnete am Mittwochnachmittag ein dringendes Treffen von Beamten an, um sicherzustellen, dass die Behörden am besten in der Lage sind, mit dem Brand und seinen Folgen fertig zu werden, wobei die Gruppe zu dem Schluss kam, dass Kontrollen in anderen Blöcken durchgeführt werden sollten. Im Jahr 2013 forderte die All-Party Parliamentary Fire Safety & Rescue Group eine Überprüfung der Sicherheitsvorschriften, nachdem bei dem Brand im Lakanal House in Camberwell im Jahr 2009 sechs Menschen starben und mehr als 20 verletzt wurden. Der ehrenamtliche Verwaltungssekretär der Gruppe, Ronnie King, sagte jedoch, dass aufeinanderfolgende Minister es versäumt hätten, die im Bericht der Gruppe geforderte Überprüfung durchzuführen.

Er fügte hinzu: „Herr Barwell sagte, er schaue es sich noch an und bereite sich auf ein Treffen mit der Allparteiengruppe vor. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt wurde die Wahl ausgerufen und das Treffen fand nie statt.“ Als die Zahl der Todesopfer in Grenfell auf 12 stieg, stellte sich auch heraus, dass Herr Lewis, der kürzlich zum Einwanderungsminister befördert wurde, es 2014 abgelehnt hatte, Bauträger zu zwingen, Sprinkler anzubringen. Der Bericht des Gerichtsmediziners im Lakanal House hatte empfohlen, die Vorschriften zu aktualisieren, und forderte, dass Entwickler, die Hochhäuser renovieren, ermutigt werden sollten, Sprinkleranlagen zu installieren. Aber fünf Jahre später sagte Herr Lewis den Abgeordneten: „Wir glauben, dass es eher in der Verantwortung der Feuerwehrindustrie als der Regierung liegt, Sprinkleranlagen effektiv zu vermarkten und ihre breitere Installation zu fördern.“ Er sagte, die Tory-Regierung habe sich verpflichtet, als erste die Vorschriften landesweit zu reduzieren und eine Eins-zu-zwei-Regel zu versprechen. Er fügte hinzu: „Die Kosten für die Installation einer Sprinkleranlage können sich auf den Wohnungsbau auswirken – etwas, das wir fördern möchten – also müssen wir abwarten, welche Auswirkungen diese Verordnung hat.“ ✕ Brandaktualisierung in Grenfell: 12 Tote, und die Zahl der Todesopfer wird voraussichtlich steigen Auch der Vorschlag von Ausgabenkürzungen könne eine Rolle spielen, sagte er: „Wenn Sie den lokalen Behörden die Finanzierung verweigern, die sie benötigen, dann wird ein Preis dafür gezahlt.“ Er fuhr fort: „Nach dem Brand in Camberwell fand eine Überprüfung statt, und die Regierung hat diese Überprüfung. „Ich glaube, wir müssen Fragen stellen, welche Einrichtungen und Ressourcen lokalen Behörden zur Verfügung gestellt wurden, die Hochhäuser in der Gegend haben, und ehrlich gesagt, die meisten haben dies. Wir müssen damit umgehen, wir brauchen Menschen, die sicher in Hochhäusern leben können.“ Auf die Frage, ob dies irgendwelche derzeit amtierenden Frontbench-Politiker betraf, antwortete er: „Offensichtlich müssen Minister befragt werden, die diesen Berichten gedient und diese erhalten haben. Aber heute muss jeder Fokus und jede Konzentration darauf gerichtet sein, Leben zu retten und zu schützen.“ Ein Regierungssprecher sagte, dass der Gerichtsmediziner nach dem Brand im Lakanal House empfohlen habe, die Leitlinien zum Brandschutz in den Bauvorschriften zu vereinfachen. Die Arbeit sei im Gange, sagte er. Der Gerichtsmediziner bat die Regierung auch, an die Räte zu schreiben und sie zu ermutigen, die Nachrüstung von Sprinklern in Betracht zu ziehen, sagte er und fügte hinzu, dass dies geschehen sei. Die feuerbeschädigten unteren Stockwerke des 24-stöckigen Wohnblocks Grenfell Tower Leon Neal/Getty Images Der Sprecher fügte hinzu: „Unsere Gedanken sind bei den Bewohnern und Familien aller, die von diesem schrecklichen Ereignis betroffen sind. Wir sind bereit, in jeder möglichen Weise zu helfen, während die Rettungsdienste die Situation weiter stabilisieren. „Die Londoner Feuerwehr wird ihre Ermittlungen durchführen, und zu diesem Zeitpunkt wäre es nicht angebracht, sich zur Brandursache zu äußern.“ Die Ursache des Feuers ist bisher unbekannt, aber Anwohner hatten zuvor Bedenken geäußert, dass ein „katastrophales“ Ereignis eintreten könnte, wobei eine Aktionsgruppe behauptete, dass ihre Warnungen auf „taube Ohren“ stießen. Die Gruppe sagte, dass es während der Verbesserungsarbeiten am Block in der Latimer Road einen Ein- und Ausgang zum Grenfell Tower gab und es Probleme mit den Evakuierungsverfahren gab. Nach dem Brand postete die Gruppe: „Alle unsere Warnungen stießen auf taube Ohren und wir sagten voraus, dass eine Katastrophe wie diese unvermeidlich und nur eine Frage der Zeit sei.“ Grenfell wurde nach einer Renovierung im Wert von 10 Millionen Pfund mit einer Regenschutzverkleidung aus Zink und einer verglasten Vorhangfassade ausgestattet, und einige haben angedeutet, dass dies die Ausbreitung des Feuers verschlimmert haben könnte, obwohl die Firma, die die Arbeiten ausführte, sagte, dass alles die Sicherheitsvorschriften erfüllte. Bei der Ankündigung eines dringenden Treffens von Ministern und Beamten nach dem Brand sagte die Premierministerin, sie sei „zutiefst traurig“. Nachdem die Sitzung beendet war, sagte Polizei- und Feuerwehrminister Nick Hurd, sie wollten den Menschen, die in anderen Gebäuden leben, so schnell wie möglich Sicherheit geben. Er sagte: „Wir haben mit dem Ministerium für Gemeinden und Kommunalverwaltung, den örtlichen Behörden und der Feuerwehr einen Prozess besprochen, bei dem wir versuchen, Türme zu identifizieren, die möglicherweise einen ähnlichen Sanierungsprozess durchlaufen, und ein Kontrollsystem durchführen, damit wir dies tun können schnellstmöglich Menschen beruhigen.“ Der Bürgermeister von London, Sadiq Khan, sagte, es gebe „Fragen, die beantwortet werden müssen“, nachdem den Bewohnern des Turms gesagt wurde, sie sollten im Brandfall in ihren Wohnungen bleiben. Herr Khan verurteilte den „schlechten Rat“, der den Bewohnern des Hochhauses im Westen Londons gegeben wurde, das über Nacht in Flammen aufging, mehrere Bewohner tötete und viele im brennenden Gebäude gefangen ließ. Ein Newsletter an die Bewohner aus dem Jahr 2014 besagte, dass die „Bleiben Sie an Ort und Stelle“-Richtlinie funktionierte, weil der Block nach „strengen Brandschutzstandards“ entworfen worden war."

c9a08752	Tom Clark: Osborne schwang seine Axt ohne Gnade Noch immer im Glanz des unerwarteten Wahlerfolgs der Konservativen badend, ist George Osborne nun entschlossen, seine neu bestätigten Tricks während des alten Parlaments im neuen Parlament zu wiederholen. Zu Beginn der Koalition stellte der neue Kanzler in seinem ersten Haushalt im Juni 2010 eine bequeme Unwahrheit fest: dass die große Rezession durch Labours wilden Ausgabenstil verursacht worden sei. Bei Großbritanniens Notstand, sagte er, ging es um staatliche Großzügigkeit, die „private Bemühungen verdrängt“. Er hat den ersten Haushalt des neuen Parlaments genutzt, um eine zweite wichtige Unwahrheit aufzudecken. Die Armut in Großbritannien ist nämlich in gewisser Weise das Ergebnis der Tatsache, dass die Regierung den armen Menschen zu viel Geld gegeben hat. Als der Kanzler Steuergutschriften für Familien verwüstete, war er schamlos darüber hinwegzutäuschen, dass dies tatsächlich die Bausteine ​​​​für den eigenen universellen Kredit der Tories sind, den er untergräbt, bevor er überhaupt in Gang gekommen ist. Schamlos vergaß er auch, wie er selbst – in den Tagen, als David Camerons Tories noch daran interessiert waren, ein gemäßigtes Gesicht zu zeigen – es für notwendig gehalten hatte, den Hauptsteuergutschriftsatz zu erhöhen, um arme Kinder zu schützen. Jetzt wurden die Kredite schlicht und einfach als das böse Vermächtnis von Gordon Brown dargestellt, das die Armen in ein abscheuliches System der Bürokratie verstrickte. Osborne versteckte sich hinter einer auffälligen Erhöhung und Umbenennung des Mindestlohns, der weniger Wirkung haben wird, als die Schlagzeilen vermuten lassen, weil er auf über 25-Jährige beschränkt ist, und schwang seine Axt gnadenlos. Kinder werden aus dem System ausgeschlossen und damit verarmt, einfach weil sie in größere Familien hineingeboren wurden. Vergessen Sie den Hype um ein Arbeitnehmerbudget: Geringverdiener können weniger von ihrem Gehaltspaket behalten, bevor sie anfangen, Sozialleistungen zu verlieren. Genau die Perversitäten, die der universelle Kredit zu lösen vorgibt, werden sich daher für diejenigen am Ende des Haufens verschärfen. Was für ein Kontrast zu der Position anderer, die höher in der Lohnskala stehen und in den Genuss realer Einkommenssteuersenkungen kommen werden. Polly Toynbee: Eine Rückkehr zu öffentlichem Elend und privatem Exzess Behalten Sie ihren Preis im Auge – das tiefe und dauerhafte Schrumpfen des Staates. Ignorieren Sie das Konfetti der Ablenkungen – schauen Sie, wohin die Reise geht. Der britische Staat mit „niedrigen Steuern und geringer Wohlfahrt“ wird bis 2019 im Verhältnis zum BIP sogar kleiner sein als die USA – weit entfernt von der europäischen sozialdemokratischen Norm. Vor diesen Kürzungen prognostizierten der IWF und die OECD, dass der britische Staat auf 36,6 % fallen würde, was den USA mit 35 % sehr nahe kommt. Deutschland liegt bei 45,4 %. Die heutigen Sozialkürzungen in Höhe von 12 Mrd. £ fügen weitere 1,6 % hinzu, sodass die britischen Ausgaben unter die amerikanischen fallen werden. Der Staat schrumpft, der Sozialstaat schwindet. Alles, was die Menschen stolz macht, schwindet, von Wissenschaft über Kunst, Verkehr, Bibliotheken, Sport, Parks und Schwimmbäder. Es ist zurück zum öffentlichen Elend inmitten privater Exzesse. Tories werden befreit, um die Besitzenden zu belohnen und die Nichtsnutzer zu verprügeln. Hurra für einen Erbschaftssteuerbonus von 1 Mio. £ für die reichsten 6 % der Familien, obwohl die 100 reichsten Menschen bis zu 19 Millionen andere besitzen. Senkung der Körperschaftssteuer, während ein FTSE-100-Chef in drei Tagen verdient, was ein durchschnittlicher Arbeitnehmer in einem Jahr verdient. Lassen Sie sich nicht von einer Mindestlohnerhöhung täuschen, die drastische Steuergutschriftkürzungen oder die 30 Pfund pro Woche, die von der Beschäftigungs- und Unterstützungszulage gestrichen werden, nicht ausgleicht. Steuersenkungen helfen den 6 Millionen, die zu schlecht bezahlt sind, nicht, um Steuern zu zahlen. Wohngeldkürzungen werden den Südosten von den Armen säubern. Dies war in der Tat ein „Notfall“-Budget für die Armen, für Kinder, für Studenten. Osborne spottete in der Sonne, er erwarte „deprimierend vorhersehbares Protestgeheul“. Nun, fang jetzt an zu heulen. Matthew d’Ancona: Ein überwältigender Sieg für die sich modernisierenden Tories Kurz bevor George Osborne aufstand, um sein bemerkenswertes Budget vorzulegen, rief mich ein hochrangiger Konservativer an, um mir mitzuteilen, dass es eine Ankündigung geben würde, die den langen Marsch der Modernisierung der Torys „abrunden“ würde. Wie sich herausstellte, war diese Prognose genau richtig. Ein Prozess, der vor einem Jahrzehnt mit David Camerons recycelten Turnschuhen und einem Fototermin mit Huskies begann, endet vorerst in der folgenschweren Einführung eines nationalen Existenzminimums. Natürlich gab es Hinweise. Osborne ist ein scharfsinniger politischer Stratege, der ohne eine ausgleichende Neuerung zur Sicherung der Ein-Nation-Reputation seiner Partei niemals die Sozialhilfe so hart getroffen hätte wie heute. Er nahm ein Kriegsbeil, um Kredite zu besteuern, und musste ein politisches Gegenleistungsangebot anbieten, eine Maßnahme, die den Prozess einleitet, solche Kredite unnötig zu machen. Warum sollte der Steuerzahler schließlich die Sparsamkeit der Arbeitgeber subventionieren? Wenn es jemals eine Idee gab, deren Zeit gekommen ist, dann ist es diese. Steve Hilton war oft Osbornes Rivale, dankt ihm aber in der Danksagung für sein jüngstes Buch More Human. Im Kapitel über Armut entwickelt Hilton ein Argument für den nationalen existenzsichernden Lohn, das meiner Meinung nach nicht zu beantworten ist: Was tut der Staat, fragt er, um Unternehmen zu stützen, die ihren Mitarbeitern keinen angemessenen Lohn zahlen? Tories hassen instinktiv Eingriffe in den Arbeitsmarkt und warnten vor Massenarbeitslosigkeit, als New Labour den nationalen Mindestlohn einführte. Schon jetzt wird es Konservative geben, die vor dieser aufgeklärten Maßnahme zurückschrecken. Aber der modernisierende Flügel der Partei investierte immer stärker in diese spezielle Idee. Im Observer dieser Woche veröffentlichte Rohan Silva, ein enger Freund von Hilton und Osborne, der für Cameron in Nr. 10 arbeitete, eine leidenschaftliche Forderung nach einem obligatorischen existenzsichernden Lohn. So viel steht fest: Silva hätte am Vorabend des ersten konservativen Etats seit 1996 niemals versucht, die Kanzlerin in Verlegenheit zu bringen. Zumindest deutete sein Artikel die Richtung an. Tory-Modernisierer haben immer argumentiert, dass die Partei am besten ist, wenn sie progressive Ziele mit Tory-Mitteln sichert. Die gleichgeschlechtliche Ehe war ein solches Beispiel. Dies ist eine andere. Es ist im Prinzip richtig, aber es ist auch eine kühne Landnahme durch Osborne, die Terrain kolonisiert, das lange Zeit der souveräne Boden der Labour Party war. Was werden die Anwärter auf die Führung zu dieser allmächtigen Wendung in der Geschichte zu sagen haben? Und wird die Tory-Rechten in der Lage sein, sich davon abzuhalten, es zu ruinieren? Bleiben Sie dran. Gaby Hinsliff: Osbornes listiger Trick wird Labour ins Wanken bringen. Das Wichtigste, woran Sie denken sollten, wenn Kanzler Kaninchen aus Hüten herstellen, ist, dass Kaninchen eigentlich nicht in Hüten heimisch sind. Es braucht viel Fingerspitzengefühl, um die verdammten Dinger dort hineinzuzwingen. So verlockend es auch ist, nur das Kaninchen anzustarren – ein obligatorischer Lebensunterhalt von 9 £ pro Stunde für alle! – Es ist normalerweise besser, mit einem kleinen Auge auf die Hand zu fokussieren. Und George Osborne war damit beschäftigt, Taschen zu durchsuchen. Was er enthüllte, war tatsächlich eine großzügigere als erwartete Erhöhung des Mindestlohns, keine existenzsichernde, da der existenzsichernde Lohn in London bereits 9,15 £ beträgt, woanders 7,85 £ und wer weiß, wo er bis 2020 liegen könnte. Es reicht nicht aus, ihn festzulegen gute Zeiten für Familien, die anfangen, Steuergutschriften zu verlieren, bevor das Minimum von 9 £ einsetzt; oder um Stunts wie die schamlose Streichung von Studienbeihilfen zu kompensieren, die im Gegensatz zu Studiengebühren Kinder aus armen Familien, die für die Universität bestimmt sind, direkt treffen werden. Die Kluft zwischen Erwerbstätigen und Arbeitslosen – insbesondere jenen, die trotz härterer neuer Arbeitsfähigkeitstests noch krank genug sind, um ESA zu bekommen, die jetzt nicht mehr als normale Arbeitslosengeld erhalten – wird sich in der Zwischenzeit stark öffnen. Es gibt Ärger. Aber das unmittelbare Ergebnis ist, dass Labour ins Wanken gerät, seine Kritik an den Tories als Anbietern von Niedriglohnjobs in Sackgassen; und es gab gerade genug unerwartete Schritte – Eindämmung des Buy-to-let-Booms durch Reduzierung der Steuererleichterungen für Vermieter, Beendigung des dauerhaften Non-Dom-Status – um die Dinge unvorhersehbar zu halten. Osbornes Ruf als politischer, wenn nicht sogar wirtschaftlicher Stratege – und damit seine eigenen Karriereaussichten – kann nur gesteigert werden. Aditya Chakrabortty: Eine ernsthafte Invasion in Labour-Territorium – aber keine substanzielle. George Osborne, der klügste Stratege der Torys, ist nicht damit zufrieden, Labour bei den Wahlen zu schlagen, sondern will nun die meisten ihrer Kleidungsstücke klauen – und sie dann zu Tode schlagen. Das war viel mehr als eine Ehrenrunde eines Budgets. Frisch nach dem Wahlsieg im Mai, als er den ersten wirklich blauen Haushalt seit fast einem Vierteljahrhundert vorstellte, hätte der Kanzler einfach aufstehen, die Maßnahmen wiederholen können, die seine Schergen in den letzten zwei Wochen an die Zeitungen weitergegeben haben, und sich zu einem Gebrüll hinsetzen können Ovation. Aber heute Nachmittag ging er so viel weiter und startete eine ernsthafte Invasion auf dem Territorium der Labour Party. Zuerst kam der Fingerhieb auf die Gegenseite und die Hinweise darauf, dass die Tories die Partei seien, die ihre Versprechen einhalte. Die wiederholten Bekenntnisse, die Konservativen seien die Partei der Arbeiter. Die Erwähnung der Errichtung des nördlichen Kraftzentrums im Kernland der Labour Party und das Angebot, mit Städten im Norden Englands zusammenzuarbeiten. Dann kam das harte Vorgehen gegen Non-Doms – nicht hart genug, aber viel besser als alles, was Blair und Brown in ihren 13 Jahren geschafft haben. Schließlich die Umbenennung des Mindestlohns in den „nationalen existenzsichernden Lohn“ und die Verpflichtung, ihn für Personen ab 25 Jahren bis 2020 auf 9 £ pro Stunde anzuheben. Vergleichen Sie das mit dem Versprechen von Ed Miliband vor den Wahlen, den Mindestlohn bis Ende dieses Jahrzehnts auf 8 Pfund pro Stunde anzuheben. Vergessen Sie Red Ed, der Kanzler schien zu sagen: Ich bin Red George. So lautet zumindest die Rhetorik. Schauen Sie sich das Detail an und es ist natürlich nicht besonders fortschrittlich. Die Anhebung des Mindestlohns ist eine großartige Nachricht – wird aber durch das Hacken von Steuergutschriften untergraben. Ich werde die Folgenabschätzungen abwarten, aber ich vermute, dass Niedriglohnfamilien mit Kindern am Ende dieses Jahrzehnts immer noch ärmer sein werden. Dann denken Sie an die Senkung der Erbschaftssteuer – eingeführt von einem Finanzministerium, das zuvor geurteilt hatte, dass „es keine starken wirtschaftlichen Argumente für die Einführung einer Erbschaftssteuerbefreiung speziell in Bezug auf Hauptwohnsitze gibt“. Wer profitiert von diesem scheinbaren Hund einer Idee? „Überproportional“ die Reichsten der Gesellschaft, so das Institute for Fiscal Studies. Denken Sie an die Senkung der Körperschaftssteuer – in einem Land, das bereits niedrigere Körperschaftssteuersätze und großzügigere Körperschaftssteuervorteile als die USA, Deutschland oder einer unserer Hauptkonkurrenten hat. Wie wir diese Woche im Guardian berichteten, übergibt die Regierung, die Milliarden aus dem Sozialhaushalt streicht, Unternehmen 93 Milliarden Pfund pro Jahr an direkter Unternehmenswohlfahrt – das entspricht 3.500 Pfund von jedem einzelnen Haushalt in Großbritannien. Schauen Sie sich die äußerst bizarren Angriffe auf Wohnungsbaugesellschaften an, die bereits damit kämpfen, den Überblick über die Leistungsänderungen zu behalten, die ihren Mietern auferlegt werden. Jetzt will Osborne noch weiter gehen, indem er sie dazu zwingt, ihre Häuser mit Rabatt zu verkaufen und die Miete zu kürzen – Häuser, die er nicht besitzt, und Miete, die er nicht einzieht. Aber dann schauen Sie hinüber zu einer Frontbank der Labour-Partei, die angesichts der Aussicht, ein weiteres Jahrzehnt ohne Macht zu verbringen, verwirrt ist, zu verängstigt, um etwas Linkes zu sagen. Die Opposition Ihrer Majestät zieht sich aus ihrem eigenen Territorium zurück – und überlässt es Osborne, hereinzustürmen und eine große blaue Flagge darauf zu hissen. Unterschätzen Sie nicht die politische Ernsthaftigkeit hinter diesem Budget: Genau wie die letzten konservativen Regierungen von Thatcher und Lawson und Major bringt diese Regierung einen überzeugenden, wahrhaft blauen Appell an die Wähler der Arbeiter- und Mittelklasse zusammen. Ja, es ist grausam für diejenigen, die schlecht bezahlt werden oder keine Arbeit haben, selbst wenn es Geld an die Reichsten weiterleitet. Aber ich würde nicht darauf setzen, dass eine schüchterne, uninspirierte Labour-Partei darauf hinweist – oder ihr eigenes Revier verteidigt.	Haushalt 2015: das Urteil unserer Kolumnisten	true
753da2b7	"Was ist das Coronavirus? Ein Coronavirus ist eine Virusart, die bei Tieren und Menschen Krankheiten verursachen kann. Viren brechen in Zellen innerhalb ihres Wirts ein und verwenden sie, um sich selbst zu reproduzieren und die normalen Funktionen des Körpers zu stören. Coronaviren sind nach dem lateinischen Wort ""Corona"" benannt, was Krone bedeutet, weil sie von einer stacheligen Hülle umgeben sind, die einer Königskrone ähnelt. Das Coronavirus aus Wuhan ist eines, das vor diesem Ausbruch noch nie gesehen wurde. Es wurde vom International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses als SARS-CoV-2 bezeichnet. Der Name steht für Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. Experten sagen, dass der Virus, der seit Beginn des Ausbruchs im Dezember etwa einen von 50 Patienten getötet hat, eine „Schwester“ der SARS-Krankheit ist, die China im Jahr 2002 heimsuchte, so wurde er genannt Danach. Die Krankheit, die das Virus verursacht, wurde COVID-19 genannt, was für Coronavirus Disease 2019 steht. Dr. Helena Maier vom Pirbright Institute sagte: „Coronaviren sind eine Familie von Viren, die eine Vielzahl verschiedener Arten infizieren, darunter Menschen und Rinder , Schweine, Hühner, Hunde, Katzen und Wildtiere. „Bis dieses neue Coronavirus identifiziert wurde, gab es nur sechs verschiedene Coronaviren, von denen bekannt ist, dass sie Menschen infizieren. Vier davon verursachen eine leichte Erkältungskrankheit, aber seit 2002 sind zwei neue Coronaviren aufgetaucht, die Menschen infizieren und zu schwereren Erkrankungen führen können. „Es ist bekannt, dass Coronaviren gelegentlich von einer Art zur anderen springen können, und das ist im Fall von SARS, MERS und dem neuen Coronavirus passiert. Der tierische Ursprung des neuen Coronavirus ist noch nicht bekannt.“ Die ersten Fälle bei Menschen wurden öffentlich aus der chinesischen Stadt Wuhan gemeldet, in der etwa 11 Millionen Menschen leben, nachdem Mediziner am 31. Dezember erstmals öffentlich über Infektionen berichtet hatten. Bis zum 8. Januar wurden 59 Verdachtsfälle gemeldet, und sieben Personen befanden sich in einem kritischen Zustand. Es wurden Tests für das neue Virus entwickelt und die Zahl der registrierten Fälle begann zu steigen. Die erste Person starb in dieser Woche und bis zum 16. Januar waren zwei tot und 41 Fälle wurden bestätigt. Am nächsten Tag sagten Wissenschaftler voraus, dass sich 1.700 Menschen infiziert hatten, möglicherweise bis zu 7.000. Woher kommt das Virus? Laut Wissenschaftlern stammt das Virus mit ziemlicher Sicherheit von Fledermäusen. Coronaviren neigen im Allgemeinen dazu, von Tieren zu stammen – es wird angenommen, dass die ähnlichen SARS- und MERS-Viren von Zibetkatzen bzw. Kamelen stammen. Die ersten Fälle von COVID-19 stammten von Personen, die einen Lebendtiermarkt in Wuhan besuchten oder dort arbeiteten, der inzwischen wegen Ermittlungen geschlossen wurde. Obwohl der Markt offiziell ein Fischmarkt ist, wurden dort auch andere tote und lebende Tiere verkauft, darunter Wolfsjunge, Salamander, Schlangen, Pfauen, Stachelschweine und Kamelfleisch. Eine Studie des Wuhan Institute of Virology, die im Februar 2020 in der Fachzeitschrift Nature veröffentlicht wurde, ergab, dass die bei Patienten in China gefundenen genetischen Make-up-Virusproben zu 96 Prozent mit einem Coronavirus identisch sind, das sie in Fledermäusen gefunden haben. Es gab jedoch nicht viele Fledermäuse auf dem Markt, daher sagen Wissenschaftler, dass es wahrscheinlich ein Tier gab, das als Mittelsmann fungierte und es von einer Fledermaus anzog, bevor es es dann auf einen Menschen übertrug. Um welche Art von Tier es sich dabei handelte, konnte noch nicht bestätigt werden. Dr. Michael Skinner, ein Virologe am Imperial College London, war nicht an der Forschung beteiligt, sagte aber: „Die Entdeckung legt den Ursprung von nCoV definitiv in Fledermäusen in China. ""Wir wissen immer noch nicht, ob eine andere Art als Zwischenwirt diente, um das Virus zu vervielfältigen und es möglicherweise sogar auf den Markt zu bringen, noch welche Art dieser Wirt gewesen sein könnte."" Bisher sind die Todesfälle recht gering. Warum sind Gesundheitsexperten so besorgt darüber? Experten sagen, dass die internationale Gemeinschaft besorgt über das Virus ist, weil so wenig darüber bekannt ist und es sich schnell auszubreiten scheint. Es ähnelt SARS, das 8.000 Menschen infizierte und fast 800 bei einem Ausbruch in Asien im Jahr 2003 tötete, da es sich um eine Art Coronavirus handelt, das die Lungen des Menschen infiziert. Es ist jedoch weniger tödlich als SARS, das etwa einen von 10 Menschen tötete, verglichen mit etwa einem von 50 bei COVID-19. Ein weiterer Grund zur Sorge ist, dass niemand gegen das Virus immun ist, weil er ihm noch nie begegnet ist. Dies bedeutet, dass es möglicherweise mehr Schaden anrichten kann als Viren, denen wir häufig begegnen, wie Grippe oder Erkältung. Bei einem Briefing im Januar sagte Dr. Peter Horby, Professor an der Universität Oxford: „Neuartige Viren können sich viel schneller in der Bevölkerung ausbreiten als Viren, die ständig zirkulieren, weil wir keine Immunität gegen sie haben. „Die meisten saisonalen Grippeviren haben eine Sterblichkeitsrate von weniger als einem von 1.000 Menschen. Hier sprechen wir von einem Virus, bei dem wir das Schwerespektrum nicht vollständig verstehen, aber es ist möglich, dass die Sterblichkeitsrate von Fällen bis zu zwei Prozent beträgt. Wenn die Sterblichkeitsrate wirklich zwei Prozent beträgt, bedeutet dies, dass zwei von 100 Patienten, die es bekommen, sterben werden. ""Mein Gefühl ist, dass es niedriger ist"", fügte Dr. Horby hinzu. „Wahrscheinlich übersehen wir diesen Eisberg milderer Fälle. Aber das ist der aktuelle Umstand, in dem wir uns befinden. „Die Sterblichkeitsrate von zwei Prozent ist vergleichbar mit der Spanischen Grippepandemie im Jahr 1918, daher ist dies weltweit ein erhebliches Problem.“ Wie verbreitet sich das Virus? Die Krankheit kann sich nur durch Husten und Niesen zwischen Menschen ausbreiten, was sie zu einer äußerst ansteckenden Infektion macht. Und es kann sich auch ausbreiten, noch bevor jemand Symptome hat. Es wird angenommen, dass es im Speichel und sogar durch Wasser in den Augen wandert, daher sind enger Kontakt, Küssen und das Teilen von Besteck oder Utensilien riskant. Es kann auch bis zu 72 Stunden auf Oberflächen wie Kunststoff und Stahl überleben, was bedeutet, dass Menschen es durch Berühren kontaminierter Oberflächen bekommen können. Ursprünglich wurde angenommen, dass die Menschen es auf einem Markt für lebende Tiere in der Stadt Wuhan fangen. Aber bald tauchten Fälle bei Menschen auf, die noch nie dort gewesen waren, was die Mediziner zwang, zu erkennen, dass es sich von Person zu Person ausbreitete. Was macht das Virus mit dir? Was sind die Symptome? Sobald sich jemand mit dem COVID-19-Virus infiziert hat, kann es zwischen zwei und 14 Tagen oder sogar länger dauern, bis er Symptome zeigt – aber er kann während dieser Zeit immer noch ansteckend sein. Typische Anzeichen dafür sind eine laufende Nase, Husten, Halsschmerzen und hohes Fieber. Die überwiegende Mehrheit der Patienten wird sich ohne Probleme davon erholen, und viele werden überhaupt keine medizinische Hilfe benötigen. Bei einer kleinen Gruppe von Patienten, bei denen es sich offenbar hauptsächlich um ältere Menschen oder Langzeitkranke handelt, kann es zu einer Lungenentzündung kommen. Eine Lungenentzündung ist eine Infektion, bei der das Innere der Lunge anschwillt und sich mit Flüssigkeit füllt. Sie erschwert das Atmen zunehmend und kann unbehandelt tödlich sein und Menschen ersticken. Zahlen zeigen, dass kleine Kinder anscheinend nicht besonders stark von dem Virus betroffen sind, was ihrer Meinung nach angesichts ihrer Anfälligkeit für Grippe eigenartig ist, aber es ist nicht klar, warum. Was haben Gentests über das Virus ergeben? Wissenschaftler in China haben die genetischen Sequenzen von etwa 19 Virusstämmen aufgezeichnet und sie an Experten auf der ganzen Welt weitergegeben. Dies ermöglicht es anderen, sie zu studieren, Tests zu entwickeln und möglicherweise die Behandlung der von ihnen verursachten Krankheiten zu untersuchen. Untersuchungen haben ergeben, dass sich das Coronavirus in den frühen Stadien seiner Ausbreitung nicht stark verändert hat – Veränderung wird als Mutation bezeichnet. Der Generaldirektor des chinesischen Zentrums für die Kontrolle und Prävention von Krankheiten, Gao Fu, sagte jedoch, das Virus mutiere und passe sich an, während es sich unter Menschen ausbreite. Dies bedeutet, dass die Bemühungen, das Virus zu untersuchen und möglicherweise zu kontrollieren, zusätzlich erschwert werden können, da das Virus bei jeder Analyse durch Wissenschaftler anders aussehen könnte. Weitere Studien könnten möglicherweise Aufschluss darüber geben, ob das Virus zuerst eine kleine Anzahl von Menschen infizierte, sich dann veränderte und von ihnen ausbreitete, oder ob es verschiedene Versionen des Virus gab, die von Tieren stammten, die sich separat entwickelt haben. Wie gefährlich ist das Virus? Das Virus hat eine Todesrate von rund zwei Prozent. Dies ist eine ähnliche Sterblichkeitsrate wie beim Ausbruch der Spanischen Grippe, bei der 1918 rund 50 Millionen Menschen ums Leben kamen. Experten sind seit Beginn des Ausbruchs umstritten, ob die tatsächliche Zahl der Infizierten wesentlich höher ist als die offiziellen Zahlen der registrierten Fälle. Von manchen Menschen wird erwartet, dass sie so milde Symptome haben, dass sie nicht einmal bemerken, dass sie krank sind, es sei denn, sie werden getestet, sodass nur die schwerwiegenderen Fälle entdeckt werden, wodurch die Zahl der Todesopfer höher erscheint, als sie wirklich ist. Eine Untersuchung der staatlichen Überwachung in China ergab jedoch, dass kein Grund zu der Annahme gefunden wurde, dass dies wahr ist. Dr. Bruce Aylward, ein Beamter der Weltgesundheitsorganisation, der eine Mission nach China unternahm, sagte, es gebe keine Beweise dafür, dass die Zahlen nur die Spitze des Eisbergs zeigten, und dass die Aufzeichnung korrekt zu sein schien, berichtete Stat News. Kann das Virus geheilt werden? Das COVID-19-Virus ist nicht heilbar und lässt sich nur schwer eindämmen. Antibiotika wirken nicht gegen Viren, kommen also nicht infrage. Antivirale Medikamente können wirken, aber der Prozess, ein Virus zu verstehen und dann Medikamente zu seiner Behandlung zu entwickeln und herzustellen, würde Jahre und riesige Geldsummen dauern. Es gibt noch keinen Impfstoff gegen das Coronavirus und es ist unwahrscheinlich, dass rechtzeitig einer entwickelt wird, um bei diesem Ausbruch von Nutzen zu sein, aus ähnlichen Gründen wie oben. Die National Institutes of Health in den USA und die Baylor University in Waco, Texas, arbeiten an einem Impfstoff, der auf ihrem allgemeinen Wissen über Coronaviren basiert und Informationen aus dem SARS-Ausbruch verwendet. Laut Pharmaceutical Technology kann die Entwicklung jedoch ein Jahr oder länger dauern. Derzeit arbeiten Regierungen und Gesundheitsbehörden daran, das Virus einzudämmen und kranke Patienten zu versorgen und zu verhindern, dass sie andere Menschen anstecken. Menschen, die sich mit der Krankheit infizieren, werden in Krankenhäusern unter Quarantäne gestellt, wo ihre Symptome behandelt werden können und sie von der nicht infizierten Öffentlichkeit ferngehalten werden. Und Flughäfen auf der ganzen Welt führen Screening-Maßnahmen ein, wie z. B. die Einrichtung von Ärzten vor Ort, die Messung der Körpertemperatur von Personen zur Überprüfung auf Fieber und die Verwendung von Wärmescreenings, um Personen zu erkennen, die möglicherweise krank sind. Infektionen verursachen eine erhöhte Temperatur. Es kann jedoch Wochen dauern, bis Symptome auftreten, sodass die Wahrscheinlichkeit gering ist, dass Patienten auf einem Flughafen entdeckt werden. Ist dieser Ausbruch eine Epidemie oder eine Pandemie? Der Ausbruch wurde am 11. März zur Pandemie erklärt. Eine Pandemie wird von der Weltgesundheitsorganisation als „weltweite Ausbreitung einer neuen Krankheit“ definiert. Zuvor sagte die UN-Agentur, die meisten Fälle außerhalb von Hubei seien vom Epizentrum „überschwappt“ worden, sodass sich die Krankheit nicht wirklich aktiv auf der ganzen Welt ausbreitete."

246c4405	Einem Bericht des National Audit Office zufolge müssen die Schulen bis 2019-20 real mit Kürzungen von 8 % rechnen. Während die Regierung sagte, die Schulfinanzierung würde zweckgebunden sein, stehen die Schulleiter vor einem Berg von erhöhten Kosten: höhere Beiträge zur Sozialversicherung und Lehrerrente, die Einführung des „nationalen existenzsichernden Lohns“, Gehaltserhöhungen und die Lehrlingsabgabe. Dafür gibt es weder zusätzliches Geld, noch steigt die Förderung pro Schüler mit der Inflation. Das NAO warnte davor, dass Kürzungen die „Bildungsergebnisse“ der Schüler gefährden könnten. Um die Sache noch schlimmer zu machen, wird auch der Zuschuss für Bildungsdienste im Wert von 600 Millionen Pfund gekürzt, was bedeutet, dass den lokalen Behörden oder Akademien weniger Geld für Dienstleistungen wie Schulverbesserungen zur Verfügung steht. In der Zwischenzeit behalten die Schulleiter nervös Vorschläge für eine neue Finanzierungsformel für Schulen im Zeitraum 2018-19 im Auge, von denen erwartet wird, dass Gelder von innerstädtischen Schulen auf ländliche Gebiete umverteilt werden. Aber selbst Schulen, die wahrscheinlich von diesem Modell profitieren, sagen, dass zusätzliches Geld durch erhöhte Kosten aufgezehrt wird. „Wir haben die Stunden unseres Beraters trotz Suizidversuchen gekürzt“ Alles wurde gekürzt. Früher haben wir viel Geld für Logopädie ausgegeben, besonders in der Grundschule, aber die Stundenzahl wurde gekürzt. Unser Gangarbeiter ist gegangen, unser Drogenarbeiter ist gegangen. Das waren wichtige Menschen in unserer Gegend, wo Studenten diese Unterstützung brauchen. Unsere Beraterin hat ihre Stunden gekürzt. Ich habe eine Reihe von Schülern, die sich einer Suizidrisikobewertung unterziehen, weil sie entweder zu Hause oder in der Schule einen Suizidversuch unternommen haben. Für diese Kinder besteht ein Teil ihrer Risikobewertung darin, dass sie den Therapeuten aufsuchen. Abgesehen von einem, der zu einer Schulphobie geworden ist, sind sie alle dabei und besuchen sie und sind meistens erfolgreich. Ich denke, das kann man der Therapie zuschreiben. Meine Sorge ist, dass es eine ziemlich große Warteliste von Kindern gibt, die nicht versucht haben, sich umzubringen, und ich sie nicht in eine Therapie bringen kann, weil wir nicht genug Kapazität haben. Außerhalb der Schule gibt es absolut keine Hilfe. Das einzige, was wir nicht gekürzt haben, sind die Klassenlehrer, aber der Personalbestand ist schlanker geworden. Wir haben Lehrassistenten, Verwaltungspersonal, leitende Führungskräfte verloren, und dazu gehörten auch Entlassungen. Wenn ein Lehrassistent ausscheidet, ersetzen wir ihn durch einen billigeren – weniger Stunden oder weniger Verantwortung. In den letzten drei Jahren haben wir 25 Menschen verloren. Zur Weihnachtszeit haben wir früher Theatergruppen eingeladen, um Pantomimen zu machen, weil viele Familien unserer Kinder so etwas einfach nicht machen. Es würde 350 £ kosten und normalerweise würden wir um Beiträge von den Eltern bitten – wir würden 100 £ bekommen und dann würden wir es aufladen. Wir können es nicht mehr aufstocken. Dieses Jahr ist es nicht passiert. Die Kluft zwischen meinen Kindern und einigen anderen Schulen in der Gegend wird mit erschreckender Geschwindigkeit größer. Eltern anderswo treten auf und zahlen für Dinge. Aber in meiner Schule habe ich mehr als eine Familie pro Jahrgang, wo die Kinder dieses Weihnachten keine Geschenke bekamen und sie in ihren Schlafzimmern saßen und Sandwiches aßen. Ich kann das nicht beheben, aber ich kann versuchen, den Schulbesuch so angenehm wie möglich zu gestalten. Schulleiter, Westengland David Waugh, Schulleiter, Cheshire: „Ich kann mir meinen eigenen Koordinator für besondere Bedürfnisse nicht leisten, also teile ich. Ich habe eine Schule mit 1.500 Schülern und die andere Schule hat 1.100 Schüler.“ „Ich verwende neun Jahre alte Computer.“ Ich habe mein Schulungsbudget für Mitarbeiter auf 10.000 £ reduziert – ich habe 178 Mitarbeiter und die Anleitung sagt es sollte zwischen 70.000 und 80.000 £ liegen. In einer Zeit, in der die Regierung jeden Kurs und jeden Prüfungslehrplan geändert hat, habe ich Mühe, mit der Schulung meiner Mitarbeiter fertig zu werden, und ich kann es mir nicht leisten, diese Kurse mit Ressourcen zu finanzieren. Ich habe im Moment 32 Abiturzeugnisse für meine Sekundarstufe, und ich teile sie in drei Kategorien ein: Abitur, die ich selbst abliefere, Abitur, für das ich eine andere Art des Absolvierens finden muss, und Abitur werde ich nie wieder anbieten. Manche Abiturienten, wie Musik und Sprachen, muss ich vielleicht gemeinsam mit anderen Schulen absolvieren. Ich kann mir meinen eigenen Koordinator für besondere Bedürfnisse [der sicherstellt, dass Schüler mit Behinderungen oder besonderen Bedürfnissen die richtige Unterstützung bekommen] nicht leisten, also teile ich mir einen mit einer anderen Schule. Ich bin eine Schule mit 1.500 Schülern und die andere Schule hat 1.100 Schüler. Ich habe alles umstrukturiert. Ich habe in den letzten Jahren 13,2 Vollzeitäquivalente Lehrkräfte durch betriebsbedingte Kündigungen und Nichtersatz aus dem System genommen. Dazu gehören zwei Mitglieder des Senior Leadership Teams. Ich stecke kein Geld in Computer, ich betreibe neun Jahre alte Computer. In meiner Schule gibt es kein schlechtes Gewissen, weil es eine verdammt gute Schule ist und die Leute bleiben wollen. Aber wenn ich in einer anderen Schule wäre, mit einer anderen Bevölkerungsgruppe, wäre das katastrophal. Als Kommune sind wir die sechstschlechtest finanzierten Schulen des Landes. Viele von uns haben auf die nationale Finanzierungsformel gewartet, um uns zu retten. Aber Cheshire East wird offiziell die 150. in der Liste der 150 Kommunalbehörden im Rahmen der neuen Finanzierungsformel. Wir werden vom sechstschlechtesten zum schlechtesten gehen. Ich kann nicht mehr zurückschneiden. David Waugh, Poynton High School, Poynton, Cheshire Sean Maher, Schulleiter, Greater London: „Wenn wir das Problem nicht lösen, könnte das System innerhalb von zwei bis drei Jahren implodieren.“ „Wir können Informatik nicht so anbieten, wie wir können „keinen lehrer leisten“ In den letzten drei Jahren haben wir eine Richtlinie eingeführt, Mitarbeiter dort nicht zu ersetzen, wo wir es nicht müssen, und letztes Jahr haben wir schließlich vier Mitarbeiter entlassen. Es war das Brutalste, was ich je tun musste, es war einfach schrecklich. Wenn Sie in der Ausbildung sind und mit Kindern arbeiten, möchten Sie Mitarbeiter, die glücklich sind und an einem Strang ziehen – versuchen Sie das und sagen Sie auch: „Einige von Ihnen verlieren Ihren Job“. Es hat eine massive Wirkung auf die Kinder. Wir verlassen uns so sehr auf unsere Lehrer; Wir sind eine hervorragende Schule und führen viele, viele breitere Lehrplanaktivitäten durch. Mitarbeiter tun dies kostenlos, aus Kulanz. Sie werden solche Dinge nicht weiter tun, wenn die Moral nicht hoch ist. Wir mussten unser Curriculumangebot prüfen und sagen: „Nun, wir können Informatik in diesem Jahrgang nicht anbieten, weil wir diesen Mitarbeiter nicht ersetzen können“. Mit diesen neuen Kursen für Abitur und GCSE kommen Mitarbeiter zu mir und sagen: „Ich möchte 2.500 £, um einen neuen Satz Lehrbücher zu kaufen“. Ich sage „nein, ich kann sie mir nicht leisten, finde einen anderen Weg, es zu tun“. Bei allem versuchst du nur, Wege zu finden, um Geld zu sparen. Wenn etwas im Gebäude kaputt geht, werden wir es nicht reparieren, es sei denn, wir müssen es tun. Uns wurde gesagt, dass kein Geld mehr im Pot ist. Eines der Dinge, die ich ärgerlich finde, ist, dass, wenn die Premierministerin beschließt, dass sie eine Politik hat, die sie ankündigen möchte, wie z. B. mehr Gymnasien, sie plötzlich Millionen finden, um neue Gymnasien zu gründen. Das Bildungswesen befindet sich an einem Wendepunkt – ich glaube wirklich, wenn wir das Finanzierungsproblem und die Rekrutierungskrise nicht lösen, dann könnte das gesamte System innerhalb von zwei bis drei Jahren implodieren. Fantastische, engagierte Unterrichtspraktiker werden sich einfach umdrehen und sagen: Ich mache diesen Job nicht mehr, nicht für dieses Geld, nicht für diese Arbeitsbelastung, nicht mit diesem Stress. Sean Maher, Richard-Challoner-Schule, New Malden, Greater London „Kein Wunder, dass die Lehrer gehen, sie haben genug.“ Wir haben einige Klassen von 34; Wir sind irgendwann auf 35 gestiegen, weil wir es uns nicht leisten konnten, eine neue Klasse zu eröffnen. Wir haben einen Jungen im Rollstuhl, der Einzelbetreuung benötigt, aber für Einzelbetreuung nicht finanziert wird, also ziehe ich Mitarbeiter aus anderen Klassen ab, die andere Kinder unterstützen sollten. Wir haben nicht genug Personal. Sie haben am Ende einen Lehrer mit 34 Kindern in einer Klasse, von denen viele besondere Bedürfnisse und medizinische Probleme haben, und Sie erhalten keine medizinische Unterstützung mehr [die früher für die spezielle Ausbildung eines Mitarbeiters bezahlt wurde]. Wir haben ein Kind mit Diabetes, das immer wieder ohnmächtig wird; Wir bekommen keine medizinische Finanzierung, um sie zu unterstützen. Kein Wunder, dass die Lehrer gehen; sie haben genug. In den letzten zwei bis drei Jahren bin ich sehr vorsichtig mit dem Budget umgegangen, aber nächstes Jahr werden wir anfangen, ins Defizit zu gehen. Wir verwenden keine Lehrer mehr für die Versorgung; Wir setzen Lehrassistenten auf höherem Niveau ein. Früher hatten wir ein ziemlich großes Kapitalbudget [das für Verbesserungen am Schulgelände bezahlt wird]. jetzt sind es 6.000 £. Ich musste bei der örtlichen Behörde beantragen, dass mein Dach ersetzt wird, und ich muss die ersten 15.000 Pfund aufbringen. Ich muss das Geld irgendwie finden. Das bedeutet, dass ich nächstes Jahr nichts für meine Lehrplanbudgets ausgeben kann – Lese- und Rechenressourcen, IT-Ausgaben und so weiter. Einige Schulen haben eine engagierte Familienverbindungsperson, aber keine der Schulen in Cambridgeshire hat eine, weil wir sie uns einfach nicht leisten können. Ich sitze hier und berate Woche für Woche dieselben Eltern und streite mich heftig mit ihnen über die Anwesenheit, weil ich nach Anwesenheit beurteilt werde. Ich verweise ständig Fälle an Sozialdienste – die sagen, dass die Schwelle nicht erreicht wird. Grundschulleiterin, Cambridgeshire Helen Longton Howorth, Schulleiterin, Brighton: „Sie führen ein Gespräch mit Lehrern darüber, ob Sie einen Satz Pritt Sticks kaufen sollen. Es ist lächerlich.“ „Ich mache mir Sorgen, Eltern um Geld zu bitten“ In Brighton haben wir eine seltsame Situation, wo im Stadtzentrum die Schulen – eher Mittelklasseschulen – voll sind, aber am Stadtrand unser Finanzierungsproblem ist, dass wir sind nicht voll. Ich habe ungefähr 100 Stellen, die ich nicht besetzen kann. Sie bekommen 3.000 £ pro Kind, also schauen Sie sich 300.000 £ an. Ich habe mein Budget bereits aufgebraucht, bevor Sie überhaupt an Finanzierungskürzungen denken. Wir haben nur kein Defizit, weil ich einen guten Geschäftsführer habe und wir absolut kein Geld ausgeben. Wir stellen keine Hilfslehrer ein, wir haben eine Person, die intern versorgt wird. Wenn jemand krank ist, neigen wir dazu, die Klassen aufzuteilen oder Lernmentoren einzusetzen, weil wir uns keine Lehrkräfte leisten können. Gott bewahre, wenn jemand lange krankgeschrieben wird, denn das würde das Budget in die roten Zahlen treiben. Es ist eine riesige Sorge. Ich verbringe viel Zeit damit, kreativ darüber nachzudenken, wie ich Geld verdienen kann. Wir müssen uns zu marktfähigen Waren machen – wir denken die ganze Zeit darüber nach, wie wir auf kreative Weise Gelder beschaffen, Gelder umleiten oder Gelder nicht ausgeben können. Unsere PTA- und Fundraising-Veranstaltungen finanzieren unsere Ausrüstung. Alle Computer werden durch die PTA finanziert. Zu Weihnachten bastelten alle Kinder im Unterricht Dekorationen und verkauften sie an die Eltern. Wir haben das Schulstück selbst gefilmt, das Wochenende damit verbracht, viele, viele DVDs zu brennen, sie billig an die Eltern zu verkaufen, und wir haben mit solchen Sachen 600 Pfund verdient. Damit wurden Ressourcen für den Unterricht bezahlt. Sie machen sich Sorgen darüber, dass wir Eltern zum Beispiel 1 £ pro Eintrittskarte berechnen, um zu kommen und den Kindern beim Spielen zuzusehen. Es ist so weit gekommen, dass Sie mit Lehrern darüber sprechen, ob sie es sich leisten können, vor Ende des Geschäftsjahres einen Satz Pritt Sticks zu kaufen – das ist ziemlich lächerlich.

f92d4814	R io 2016 ist offiziell Großbritanniens beste Olympiade in Übersee, nachdem sie die Bilanz von Peking mit 47 Medaillen übertroffen haben, fünf Tage vor Schluss. Die Bronzemedaille des Boxers Josh Buatsi brachte Großbritannien 48 Medaillen ein, als sie die bisherige Bestmarke in Peking vor acht Jahren übertrafen, und sie hatten am Ende des Spiels am Dienstag 50 in der Tasche. Kurz nachdem die Medaille von Buatsi bestätigt wurde, triumphierte der Radfahrer Jason Kenny im Keirin der Männer und brachte das Team GB in Rio auf 19 Goldmedaillen – die gleiche Anzahl, die in Peking gewonnen wurde. Es war ein goldener Tag für Kenny und seine Verlobte Laura Trott, mit der Goldmedaillenbilanz des verlobten Paares im zweistelligen Bereich – wobei das Paar nun 10 zusammen vorweisen kann. Großbritanniens olympischer Goldrausch – wer hat bisher was in Rio gewonnen? Trott war die erste britische Frau, die mit ihrem Sieg im Omnium vier olympische Goldmedaillen gewann, während Kenny den britischen Rekord von Sir Chris Hoy erreichte, nachdem er sein sechstes olympisches Gold gewonnen hatte, indem er den höchsten Titel im Keirin holte. Es gibt noch viel zu tun, um die Bilanz von London 2012 mit 65 Medaillen, davon 29 Goldmedaillen, zu erreichen, aber es bleiben noch viele Chancen. Trott weinte an der Seitenlinie, als Kenny mit erhobenen Armen seine Ehrenrunde radelte, bevor sich das Paar umarmte und küsste, während die Menge jubelte. Im Gespräch mit der BBC nach seinem Sieg sagte Kenny: „Heute fühlte sich wirklich wie ein Traum an, ich glaube, ich bin einfach so müde, dass ich nur durch ihn schwebe. Also ja, ich habe es heute wirklich genossen.

664308f8	Plastikstrohhalme, Rührstäbchen und Wattestäbchen sollen in England ab April nächsten Jahres verboten werden, ein Schritt, den Aktivisten begrüßt, aber davor gewarnt haben, dass er „nur an der Oberfläche kratzen“ wird, um die Schäden anzugehen, die nicht abbaubarer Abfall der Umwelt zufügt. Der Umweltminister Michael Gove bestätigte das Verbot der Lieferung der Artikel, nachdem eine offene Konsultation eine „überwältigende“ öffentliche Unterstützung für den Umzug ergeben hatte. Das Verbot wird Ausnahmen beinhalten, um sicherzustellen, dass Menschen mit medizinischen Bedürfnissen oder einer Behinderung weiterhin Zugang zu Plastikstrohhalmen haben, sagte die Regierung. Herr Gove sagte: „Es sind dringende und entschlossene Maßnahmen erforderlich, um die Plastikverschmutzung zu bekämpfen und unsere Umwelt zu schützen. Diese Gegenstände werden oft nur wenige Minuten lang verwendet, aber es dauert Hunderte von Jahren, bis sie zerfallen, in unseren Meeren und Ozeanen landen und wertvolle Meereslebewesen schädigen. „Deshalb ergreife ich heute Maßnahmen, um das Blatt gegen die Plastikverschmutzung zu wenden und sicherzustellen, dass wir unsere Umwelt für zukünftige Generationen in einem besseren Zustand hinterlassen.“ Senegals Plastikmüll-Krise Alle anzeigen 10 1 /10 Senegals Plastikmüll-Krise Senegals Plastikmüll-Krise Senegalesische Jungen spielen an einem Strandabschnitt, der von einem großen Sturm erodiert wurde und Schichten von Müll im Strandsand im Fischerdorf Yenne Todd in freilegt Senegal, 24.

EPA-EFE In England verwenden wir nach Angaben der Regierung schätzungsweise 4,7 Milliarden Plastikstrohhalme, 316 Millionen Plastikrührstäbchen und 1,8 Milliarden Wattestäbchen mit Plastikstiel pro Jahr.

Die Konsultation ergab, dass 80 Prozent der Befragten ein Verbot der Verteilung und des Verkaufs von Plastikstrohhalmen, 90 Prozent ein Verbot von Rührstäbchen und 89 Prozent ein Verbot von Baumwolle befürworteten Knospen. Papierstrohhalme und Wattestäbchen mit Papierstiel sind bereits weit verbreitet. Es wird geschätzt, dass über 150 Millionen Tonnen Plastikmüll die Weltmeere verschmutzen und jedes Jahr etwa eine Million Vögel und über 100.000 Meeressäuger sterben, weil sie Plastikmüll fressen und sich darin verfangen. Ein kürzlich veröffentlichter Bericht schätzt, dass sich die Menge an Plastik im Meer bis 2025 verdreifachen wird. Das Verbot von Strohhalmen, Rührstäbchen und Wattestäbchen ist die jüngste Politik, die von der britischen Regierung angekündigt wurde, um hart gegen Plastik vorzugehen. Das Verbot von Plastikmikroperlen trat letztes Jahr in Kraft, und die 5-Pence-Gebühr für Plastiktüten wurde 2015 eingeführt – was laut Regierung dazu geführt hat, dass neun Milliarden weniger Tüten verteilt wurden. Sam Chetan-Welsh, politischer Aktivist von Greenpeace UK, sagte: „Es hat lange gedauert, aber wir begrüßen die Nachricht, dass DEFRA endlich ein Verbot von Wegwerfkunststoffen wie Strohhalmen, Wattestäbchen und Rührstäbchen durchsetzt. Die Realität ist jedoch, dass diese Verbote nur an der Oberfläche kratzen. „Um die Plastikkrise wirklich anzugehen, brauchen wir von dieser Regierung größere, mutigere Maßnahmen – einschließlich Zielen zur radikalen Reduzierung der Produktion von Einwegkunststoffen und eines umfassenden Pfandsystems für Getränkebehälter.“ Laura Foster von der Marine Conservation Society sagte: „Wir freuen uns über diese Regierungsentscheidung, die den Verbrauchern helfen wird, zu einem plastikfreieren Lebensstil überzugehen. ✕ Unterstützen Sie frei denkenden Journalismus und nehmen Sie an unabhängigen Veranstaltungen teil „Umfragen im vergangenen Jahr während unserer Great British Beach Clean zeigten beispielsweise, dass Wattestäbchen zu den Top 10 der von Freiwilligen gefundenen Gegenstände gehörten – mit durchschnittlich 17 gefundenen pro 100 Meter Strand England. Es ist richtig, dass Wattestäbchen aus Plastik verboten werden sollten. „Obwohl wir die heutige Ankündigung sehr begrüßen, brauchen wir jetzt Michael Gove, um weiter daran zu arbeiten, den Kunststoffverbrauch insgesamt zu reduzieren und die Recyclingquoten zu erhöhen, insbesondere mit einem vollumfänglichen Pfandsystem für Flaschen und Glas. „Es ist klar, dass sich die Stimmung in der Öffentlichkeit geändert hat, und was wir jetzt sehen müssen, sind weitere Maßnahmen von Einzelhändlern und der Regierung, um einen Schritt gegen alle Einwegkunststoffe zu fördern und das Recycling zu verbessern.“ Lauren West von Muscular Dystrophy UK sagte: „Plastikstrohhalme sind manchmal die einzige Art von Strohhalmen, die für Menschen mit Behinderungen geeignet sind, da sie flexibel sind und in heißen und kalten Getränken verwendet werden können. „Wir freuen uns, dass die Regierung dies in ihren heute vorgelegten Vorschlägen anerkannt hat.“	Plastikstrohhalme und Wattestäbchen sollen nächstes Jahr verboten werden, um die Plastikverschmutzung zu bekämpfen	false
58985a7d	Die Wut der Familien über unnötige Tragödien, wenn überarbeitetes Personal kranke und ältere Menschen ausfallen lässt, die „zu Tode vergessen“ werden. Exklusiv Shaun Wooller 8. Januar 2017, 23:11 Uhr Aktualisiert: 10. Januar 2017, 8:20 Uhr MINDESTENS zwei Briten pro Tag verdursten oder Hunger in unseren Krankenhäusern und Pflegeheimen. Die entsetzliche Statistik erhöhte den Druck auf Gesundheitsminister Jeremy Hunt, dem von der Krise heimgesuchten NHS zu Hilfe zu kommen. Aus den Augen ... Patienten werden in einem Sozialversicherungsskandal, der letzte Nacht landesweite Empörung auslöste, „zu Tode vergessen“ 10 Aus den Augen ... Patienten werden in einem Sozialversicherungsskandal, der zuletzt landesweite Empörung auslöste, „zu Tode vergessen“. nightCredit: Alamy Age UK beschrieb die Situation gestern Abend als „schrecklich“. Kritiker machen die bahnbrechende Arbeitsbelastung der NHS-Mitarbeiter verantwortlich, von denen viele nicht die Zeit haben, den Patienten beim Essen und Trinken zu helfen. Interessengruppen weisen auch auf die schlechte Qualität der servierten Speisen hin. Unterernährung wurde auf den Sterbeurkunden von 297 Patienten erwähnt, die im Jahr 2015 im Krankenhaus starben, während Dehydrierung auf 429 angegeben wurde. Bei Pflegeheimen waren es 54 bzw. 76. Viele der Patienten waren möglicherweise nicht in der Lage, Tassen oder Besteck zu halten, andere haben vielleicht vergessen, dass sie essen müssen. In 47 der Fälle von Dehydration und 66 der Fälle von Unterernährung wurde dies als Haupttodesursache identifiziert. Hunger und Durst waren ein Faktor bei den verbleibenden 743. „Zu Tode vergessen“ … Kritiker machen die halsbrecherische Arbeitsbelastung der NHS-Mitarbeiter verantwortlich, von denen viele nicht die Zeit haben, Patienten beim Essen und Trinken zu helfen 10 „Zu Tode vergessen“ . ..Kritiker geben den NHS-Mitarbeitern die Schuld an der erdrückenden Arbeitsbelastung, von denen viele nicht die Zeit haben, den Patienten beim Essen und Trinken zu helfenBildnachweis: Getty Images Im Laufe des Jahres starben jeden Tag durchschnittlich zwei Patienten entweder unterernährt oder dehydriert. Ian Mack, dessen Vater 2008 im Krankenhaus an Dehydrierung starb, sagte: „Er wurde absolut zu Tode vergessen.“ Joyce Robins von Patient Concern sagte gestern Abend: „Jeder dieser Todesfälle ist eine Tragödie. „Krankenstationen sind voll und das Personal ist überfordert, da es sich um so viele Patienten kümmert, dass es unmöglich ist, ihnen die Pflege zu geben, die sie brauchen. „Die Patienten brauchen Hilfe beim Essen oder Trinken, werden aber vernachlässigt.“ Die Zahlen des Office of National Statistics kommen, nachdem das Britische Rote Kreuz vor einer „humanitären Krise“ im NHS gewarnt hatte. Und Dr. Taj Hassan, Präsident des Royal College of Emergency Medicine, sagte am Freitag: „Das Notfallversorgungssystem liegt trotz der enormen Anstrengungen des Personals auf den Knien.“ Überforderte Unfalleinheiten erreichen wichtige Leistungsziele nicht und weisen Krankenwagen ab. Die Regierung hat die Ausgaben für die Sozialfürsorge gekürzt, Ärzte und Krankenschwestern sind mit Rekordzahlen von Patienten überlastet und Pflegeheime haben Mühe, Personal einzustellen. Trauer ... Gesundheitsminister Jeremy Hunt hat zuvor von seiner Verwüstung gesprochen, nachdem er gehört hatte, wie ein 100-jähriger Patient an Dehydration gestorben war 10 Trauer ... Gesundheitsminister Jeremy Hunt hat zuvor von seiner Verwüstung gesprochen, nachdem er gehört hatte, wie ein 100-jähriger alter Patient starb an DehydrationGutschrift: PA:Press Association Inspektionen ergaben, dass 312 Pflegeheime die Bewohner zwischen Januar 2015 und November 2016 nicht ausreichend ernährten und mit Flüssigkeit versorgten. Dies macht eines von 50 Pflegeheimen aus, das sich um 11.500 Menschen kümmert. Die Daten zeigen auch, dass täglich Millionen von Patientenmahlzeiten weggeworfen werden. Caroline Abrahams von Age UK sagte: „Es ist erschreckend, daran zu denken, dass ältere Menschen sterben, weil sie in Pflegeheimen und Krankenhäusern nicht genug zu essen oder zu trinken haben. „Unbehandelte Mangelernährung hat schwerwiegende Folgen, wie diese neuen Zahlen zeigen.“ Gesundheitsminister Jeremy Hunt hat zuvor von seiner Verwüstung gesprochen, nachdem er gehört hatte, wie ein 100-jähriger Patient an Dehydration starb. Urgroßmutter Lydia Spilner starb im Februar 2012 in der Leicester Royal Infirmary, nachdem die Bitten ihrer Tochter um einen Tropf ignoriert worden waren. Die Universitätskliniken des Leicester NHS Trust gaben zu, dass Lydia an einem durch Dehydration verursachten Nierenversagen gestorben war, und zahlten ihrer Familie eine nicht genannte Summe. Herr Hunt sagte damals: „Diese Geschichte ist verheerend. Es gibt noch zu viele Stellen, an denen der Patient nicht im Vordergrund steht.“ Die NHS Litigation Authority sagte, dass in den letzten fünf Jahren 311.750 £ als Entschädigung an Patienten und ihre Familien gezahlt wurden, nachdem sie behaupteten, schlechte Pflege habe Unterernährung verursacht. Kein Platz … überwältigte Unfalleinheiten erreichen wichtige Leistungsziele nicht und weisen Krankenwagen ab 10 Kein Platz … überforderte Unfalleinheiten erreichen wichtige Leistungsziele nicht und weisen Krankenwagen abBildnachweis: Getty Images Es ist unglaublich wichtig, dass Ärzte, Krankenschwestern und Pflegekräfte die Warnzeichen frühzeitig erkennen und dafür sorgen, dass älteren Menschen geholfen wird. „Sie brauchen Schulungen, um gefährdete ältere Menschen zu identifizieren, und die Fähigkeiten, um sicherzustellen, dass ältere Menschen alle Lebensmittel und Getränke erhalten, die sie benötigen. Das kann bedeuten, sich zu ihnen zu setzen, um ihnen beim Essen und Trinken zu helfen. „Der Regierung kommt eine wichtige Rolle dabei zu, sicherzustellen, dass die Finanzierung vorhanden ist, um eine qualitativ hochwertige Versorgung zu unterstützen. Unsere Sorge ist, dass diese Zahlen ein weiteres Zeichen dafür sind, dass unser System zur Pflege älterer Menschen versagt.“ Der Gesundheitssprecher der Liberaldemokraten, Norman Lamb, sagte: „Es ist ehrlich gesagt ein nationaler Skandal, dass Menschen an Durst und Hunger sterben. Das Personal ist überarbeitet und die Patienten sind gefährdet. „Jeder, der einmal im Krankenhaus war, weiß auch, wie schlecht das Essen ist. Wir müssen es beheben. „Die Leute erwarten kein Ritz, aber es muss essbar sein. „Wie können wir in einem Land leben, das kranken Menschen kein Wasser geben kann? Es ist unverschämt. „Theresa May bestreitet das Ausmaß der Krise, mit der der NHS konfrontiert ist. “Die Realität ist, dass die chronische Unterfinanzierung durch ihre Regierung unseren NHS in den Boden treibt.” Unter Druck ... Die Regierung hat die Ausgaben für die Sozialfürsorge gekürzt, Ärzte und Krankenschwestern haben es mit Rekordzahlen von Patienten zu tun PatientenBildnachweis: Getty Images Schattengesundheitsminister Jon Ashworth sagte: „Dies sind zutiefst traurige Zahlen, die ein Bild von der Belastung zeichnen, die die Regierung dem NHS auferlegt hat. Die Finanzierungslücke und die Belastung von Krankenhäusern und Pflegeheimen haben einen kritischen Punkt erreicht. „Der Premierminister muss für diese Krise aufwachen, die geplanten 700 Millionen Pfund an Sozialfürsorgemitteln vorziehen und eine neue Finanzierungsvereinbarung für den NHS und die Sozialfürsorge im Haushalt zusichern.“ Die 856 Erwähnungen stellen einen kleinen Anstieg gegenüber 833 im Jahr 2014 dar, sind jedoch von mehr als 1.000 pro Jahr im vorangegangenen Jahrzehnt zurückgegangen. Der umstrittene Liverpool Care Pathway – bei dem der Tod von Patienten durch den Entzug von Nahrung und Wasser beschleunigt wurde – wurde 2013 eingestellt. Patienten wurden oft auf den Weg gebracht, ohne dass die Angehörigen informiert wurden. Krankenhäuser erhielten außerdem einen Geldanreiz für jeden Patienten. Die Richtlinien, die das LCP ersetzten, besagen, dass die sterbende Person mindestens täglich auf Dehydration untersucht und auf Wunsch beim Trinken unterstützt oder mit medizinisch unterstützter Flüssigkeitszufuhr versorgt werden sollte. Beschämend … Norman Lamb, Gesundheitssprecher der Liberaldemokraten, sagte: „Es ist ehrlich gesagt ein nationaler Skandal, dass Menschen an Durst und Hunger sterben.

Der Premierminister gab zu, dass derzeit „enormer Druck“ auf Krankenhäuser und Hausarztpraxen ausgeübt wird, fügte jedoch hinzu: „Ich akzeptiere die Beschreibung des Roten Kreuzes nicht.“ Auch Forderungen nach einer weiteren Notrettung des Gesundheitswesens wies sie zurück. Grundversorgung vernachlässigt Stanley Mack, 77, starb an Dehydration, nachdem er in das Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham eingeliefert worden war 10 Stanley Mack, 77, starb an Dehydration, nachdem er in das Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham eingeliefert worden war Eine Untersuchung im Jahr 2013 erfuhr, dass Stanley Mack, 77, gestorben war an Dehydrierung, nachdem er im Juli 2008 in das Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham eingeliefert worden war. Der ehemalige Rover-Arbeiter war ursprünglich mit einer Brustinfektion eingeliefert worden, bei der später der Superbug C.diff diagnostiziert wurde. Sein Sohn Ian sagte: „Es war die Aufgabe des Krankenhauses, die Grundlagen richtig zu machen, und ganz klar sind sie gescheitert. Er war absolut zu Tode vergessen.“ Stanleys Witwe Carol sagte: „Er bekam Getränke und gelegentlich wurden sie als an ihn gegeben geschrieben, aber wir wussten, dass er es nicht trank.“ Erstickungsrisiko der Bewohner Das Pflegeheim Windsor in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, verwaltete die Flüssigkeitszufuhr und Ernährung der Bewohner nicht sicher Gefahr, an Essen zu ersticken, und ohne ausreichenden Zugang zu Getränken, wie eine Inspektion ergab. Die Care Quality Commission sagte, das Windsor Care Home in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, habe es versäumt, die Flüssigkeitszufuhr und Ernährung der Bewohner sicher zu verwalten. Die Inspektoren sahen einen Bewohner ersticken, nachdem ihnen die falsche Textur verabreicht worden war. Es wurden auch schlecht aufgezeichnete Nahrungs- und Flüssigkeitsdiagramme festgestellt. In dem Bericht heißt es: „In den Pflegeplänen waren keine Zielmengen festgelegt, daher war es nicht möglich zu wissen, ob jede Person die richtige tägliche Menge an Flüssigkeit hatte.“ Das Haus wurde letzte Woche als unzureichend gebrandmarkt.

87a297a2	"Der heute veröffentlichte NHS-Langzeitplan wird fast eine halbe Million weitere Leben retten, indem praktische Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Todesfälle und Investitionen in erstklassige Behandlungen, einschließlich Genomtests für jedes krebskranke Kind, getätigt werden. Die Blaupause, um den NHS fit für die Zukunft zu machen, wird die neuesten Technologien verwenden, wie z. B. digitale Hausarztkonsultationen für alle, die dies wünschen, gepaart mit Früherkennung und einem erneuten Fokus auf Prävention, um jährlich schätzungsweise 85.000 vorzeitige Todesfälle zu stoppen. Die heute von NHS-Führungskräften skizzierten Maßnahmen werden dazu beitragen, 150.000 Herzinfarkte, Schlaganfälle und Demenzfälle zu verhindern, während mehr als drei Millionen Menschen in den nächsten zehn Jahren von neuen und verbesserten Schlaganfall-, Beatmungs- und Herzversorgungsdiensten profitieren werden. Die Patienten werden von Dienstleistungen profitieren, die von verbesserter Neugeborenenversorgung für neue Eltern und Babys bis hin zu lebensverändernder Schlaganfalltherapie und integrierter Unterstützung reichen, um ältere Menschen aus dem Krankenhaus herauszuhalten und ein längeres und unabhängigeres Leben zu führen. Der NHS Long Term Plan ist auch das erste Mal in der 70-jährigen Geschichte des NHS, dass es eine neue Garantie gibt, dass die Investitionen in die primäre, kommunale und psychische Gesundheitsversorgung schneller wachsen werden als das wachsende Gesamtbudget des NHS. Damit wird ein neues Servicemodell in Höhe von 4,5 Milliarden £ für das 21. Jahrhundert in ganz England finanziert, bei dem Gesundheitseinrichtungen zusammenkommen, um in Partnerschaft mit der lokalen Regierung eine bessere, vernetzte Versorgung bereitzustellen. Die Verpflichtung zur Bekämpfung schwerwiegender körperlicher Erkrankungen geht mit der größten Investition aller Zeiten in psychische Gesundheitsdienste einher, die bis 2023/24 auf mindestens 2,3 Mrd. GBP pro Jahr steigen wird. Aufbauend auf der erheblichen Expansion in den letzten Jahren sieht der langfristige Plan vor, dass rund zwei Millionen weitere Menschen, die unter Angstzuständen, Depressionen oder anderen Problemen leiden, in den nächsten zehn Jahren Hilfe erhalten, einschließlich frischgebackener Väter und Mütter, und 24-Stunden-Zugang zur Krisenversorgung über den NHS 111. Der NHS-Langzeitplan wird außerdem: eine digitale „Haustür“ zum Gesundheitswesen öffnen, die es Patienten ermöglicht, auf Knopfdruck Zugang zur Gesundheitsversorgung zu erhalten Gentests für ein Viertel der Menschen mit gefährlich hohem angeborenem Cholesterin bereitzustellen , das rund 30.000 Menschen erreicht. 345.000 weitere Kinder und Jugendliche bei der psychischen Gesundheit durch den Ausbau von gemeindenahen Diensten, auch in Schulen, unterstützen. Einsatz modernster Scans und Technologien, einschließlich des potenziellen Einsatzes künstlicher Intelligenz, um die bestmögliche Schlaganfallversorgung zu gewährleisten Europa mit über 100.000 mehr Menschen, die jedes Jahr auf neue, bessere Dienste zugreifen. Investieren Sie in eine frühere Erkennung und bessere Behandlung von Atemwegserkrankungen, um vorzubeugen nt 80.000 Krankenhauseinweisungen und intelligente Inhalatoren werden erprobt, damit Patienten ihren Zustand problemlos überwachen können, unabhängig davon, wo sie sich befinden richtige Paket an Unterstützung, ohne eine Übernachtung zu benötigen. Der Geschäftsführer von NHS England, Simon Stevens, sagte: „Der NHS feiert sein 70-jähriges Bestehen, und die nationale Debatte hat sich zu Recht auf drei große Wahrheiten konzentriert. Wir sind stolz auf den anhaltenden Erfolg unseres Gesundheitsdienstes und auf das gemeinsame soziale Engagement, für das er steht. Es gab Bedenken – über Finanzierung, Personal, zunehmende Ungleichheiten und den Druck einer wachsenden und alternden Bevölkerung. Und es gab auch berechtigten Optimismus – in Bezug auf die Möglichkeiten für kontinuierlichen medizinischen Fortschritt und bessere Behandlungsergebnisse. „Mit Blick auf den 80. Geburtstag des Gesundheitsdienstes wirkt sich dieser NHS-Langzeitplan auf alle drei dieser Realitäten aus. Es bewahrt all das Gute an unserem Gesundheitsdienst und seinen Platz in unserem nationalen Leben. Es bewältigt den Druck, dem unsere Mitarbeiter ausgesetzt sind. Und es legt einen praktischen, kalkulierten, abgestuften Fahrplan für die Prioritäten des NHS für die Pflegequalität und die Verbesserung der Ergebnisse für das kommende Jahrzehnt fest.“ Siebzig Jahre nach der Gründung des NHS wird der Gesundheitsdienst die Versorgung von Patienten und ihren Familien in jeder Lebensphase erweitern und Menschen dabei unterstützen, gut zu beginnen, gut zu leben und gut zu altern. Der NHS wird der erste Gesundheitsdienst der Welt sein, der die Sequenzierung des gesamten Genoms für krebskranke Kinder und junge Menschen mit einer seltenen genetischen Störung anbietet, zusätzlich zu Erwachsenen, die an bestimmten seltenen Erkrankungen oder bestimmten Krebsarten leiden. Die neuen, individuell zugeschnittenen Behandlungen werden zusammen mit hochmodernen Testdiensten eingeführt, die dazu führen werden, dass drei Viertel der Krebspatienten früh diagnostiziert werden, wenn die Erkrankung leichter zu behandeln ist, gegenüber der Hälfte derzeit, was 55.000 Leben pro Jahr rettet. Rund 23.000 vorzeitige Todesfälle und 50.000 Krankenhauseinweisungen werden in den nächsten zehn Jahren verhindert, indem jedes Jahr über 100.000 Patienten mit Herzproblemen durch ein gesundes Lebens- und Bewegungsprogramm geführt werden. Die Gesundheit von Kindern und Jugendlichen wird mit der Einführung eines neuen Transformationsprogramms Priorität haben, um die Erfüllung der Verpflichtungen für die nächsten zehn Jahre zu überwachen, von der Zusammenführung von psychischer und körperlicher Pflege bis hin zu Diensten für 0-25 Jahre, damit die Pflege zeitnah und kontinuierlich erfolgt. Ein erneuter Fokus auf Prävention, einschließlich Maßnahmen, die Menschen helfen, ein gesünderes Leben zu führen, wird Tausende von Menschen davon abhalten, lebensbedrohliche oder einschränkende Erkrankungen zu entwickeln, einschließlich der Ausweitung des Diabetes-Präventionsprogramms. Und da immer mehr Menschen länger leben, wird die Pflege zunehmend bei den Menschen zu Hause oder an einem geeigneten Ort erfolgen, wodurch in Krankenhäusern Platz für diejenigen geschaffen wird, die ihn am dringendsten benötigen. Ian Dalton, Chief Executive von NHS Improvement, sagte: „Das Herzstück des NHS sind hart arbeitende Mitarbeiter, die jeden Tag alle Register ziehen, um sich um Patienten zu kümmern. Ihrem Engagement ist es zu verdanken, dass der NHS auf der ganzen Welt bewundert wird und in den letzten sieben Jahrzehnten große Fortschritte gemacht hat. „Wir müssen auf diesen Errungenschaften aufbauen und die neue Investition optimal nutzen, um die Funktionsweise des NHS grundlegend neu zu gestalten, damit unsere wachsende und alternde Bevölkerung die richtige Pflege zur richtigen Zeit und am richtigen Ort erhält. „Dies bedeutet, organisatorische Barrieren abzubauen, um einen ganzheitlicheren Ansatz für die Bereitstellung und Bezahlung der Pflege zu verfolgen, neue und bestehende Technologien zu nutzen, die richtige Anzahl von Mitarbeitern einzustellen und zu halten und den Fokus von Krankenhäusern auf Prävention und Pflege zu verlagern in der Gemeinschaft. „Der langfristige Plan wurde von Mitarbeitern des NHS entwickelt und enthält einen spannenden Fahrplan dafür, wie wir dies gemeinsam zum Wohle der Patienten tun werden.“ Professor Carrie MacEwen, Vorsitzende der Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, sagte: „Es ist gut, einen Plan zu haben, der eine klare Richtung für den NHS vorgibt und viele der Probleme angeht, von denen die Akademie seit langem sagt, dass sie angegangen werden müssen, wenn wir uns verbessern wollen Patientenversorgung. Unsere Herausforderung besteht jetzt darin, dafür zu sorgen, dass es richtig umgesetzt wird, und in dieser Hinsicht müssen wir, das heißt alle, die im NHS arbeiten, und Patienten, die den Dienst nutzen, alle unseren Beitrag leisten, wenn wir ihn zum Erfolg führen wollen.“ Simon Gillespie, Geschäftsführer der British Heart Foundation, sagte: „Dieser Plan ist ein willkommener und bedeutender Schritt im Kampf gegen Herz- und Kreislauferkrankungen, der verspricht, in den kommenden Jahren Tausende von Menschenleben zu retten. „Der starke Fokus des Plans auf die Verbesserung der Prävention und Erkennung von Herz- und Kreislauferkrankungen und deren Risikofaktoren hat das Potenzial, einen großen Unterschied zu machen und sicherzustellen, dass die Sterblichkeitsraten in Zukunft weiter sinken. Darüber hinaus wird eine bessere Versorgung und Unterstützung von Menschen mit Herzinsuffizienz die Lebensqualität vieler Menschen erheblich verbessern. ""Es ist jetzt wichtig, dass die Arbeit an der Umsetzung dieses Transformationsplans in die Tat umgesetzt wird."" Paul Farmer, Chief Executive von Mind, sagte: „Wir freuen uns sehr zu sehen, dass die psychische Gesundheit im langfristigen Plan des NHS einen so wichtigen Schwerpunkt darstellt, und wir begrüßen die 2,3 Milliarden Pfund, die für psychische Gesundheitsdienste vorgesehen sind. Dies ist die Art nachhaltiger Investitionen, die wir brauchen, um die psychische Gesundheit der körperlichen Gesundheit gleichzustellen, und wenn dieser Plan umgesetzt wird, wird dieser Plan das Leben von Tausenden von Menschen mit psychischen Gesundheitsproblemen verändern. „Alle müssen jetzt zusammenarbeiten, um die benötigten Arbeitskräfte zu entwickeln und diese Pläne umzusetzen und sicherzustellen, dass das Geld an vorderster Front ankommt. Lokale Entscheidungsträger müssen ihre eigenen Pläne entwickeln, und der Nachweis der Bereitstellung wird in den Erfahrungen der Menschen liegen, die versuchen, auf die von ihnen benötigten Dienstleistungen zuzugreifen.“ Lynda Thomas, Chief Executive von Macmillan, sagte: „Es war ein Privileg, mit NHSE zusammenzuarbeiten, um den Krebsabschnitt des langfristigen Plans zu gestalten. Ich freue mich, dass Krebs weiterhin eine hohe Priorität hat. Einer von zwei Menschen wird im Laufe seines Lebens eine Krebsdiagnose erhalten, und der Plan legt wichtige Meilensteine ​​fest, um das Überleben zu verbessern und eine qualitativ hochwertige personalisierte Versorgung für jeden Patienten sicherzustellen. Ich freue mich auf die weitere Zusammenarbeit mit dem NHS, um diese Meilensteine ​​zu erreichen und die Krebsbehandlung für Patienten jetzt und in Zukunft zu verbessern.“"	Langfristiger Plan des NHS zur Bekämpfung schwerwiegender Todesfälle und zur Rettung von bis zu einer halben Million Menschenleben	other
66e01970	"Ein Abgeordneter der Liberaldemokraten hat einen Parlamentsentwurf eingebracht, der es zu einer Straftat machen würde, ohne ihre Erlaubnis den Rock einer Person zu fotografieren. Wera Hobhouse stellte den Gesetzentwurf vor, nachdem sie festgestellt hatte, dass „Upskirting“ nicht illegal ist, da es kein spezifisches Verbrechen gibt, das die Tat abdeckt. Infolgedessen war die Polizei oft nicht in der Lage, Personen anzuklagen, bei denen festgestellt wurde, dass sie ohne ihre Erlaubnis unangemessene Fotos von Frauen machten. Der Gesetzentwurf von Frau Hobhouse würde den Sexual Offenses Act 2003 ändern, um Upskirting als Straftat unter einem Abschnitt über Voyeurismus hinzuzufügen. Die Vorschläge sehen vor, dass jeder, der des Verbrechens für schuldig befunden wird, mit einer Geldstrafe oder einer Gefängnisstrafe von bis zu zwei Jahren belegt wird. Die Abgeordnete von Bath wird sich mit Regierungsministern treffen, um das Gesetz zu erörtern, von dem sie hofft, dass es mit parteiübergreifender Unterstützung verabschiedet wird. Upskirting wurde 2009 in Schottland für illegal erklärt, aber in England und Wales wurden keine entsprechenden Gesetze verabschiedet. Der Gesetzesvorschlag von Frau Hobhouse basiert auf der schottischen Version.

Im Gespräch mit The Independent sagte Frau Hobhouse: „Es ist eine sehr abscheuliche Praxis – es ist demütigend, es ist erniedrigend, es passt nicht zu dem, was wir als Frauen im 21. Jahrhundert erwarten. „Es ist diskriminierend und widerlich und es gibt eine sehr einfache Änderung, die es zu einer Straftat machen würde.“ Sie fügte hinzu: „Es ist mir zum Glück noch nie passiert, aber ich weiß, wie peinlich und schrecklich ich mich fühlen würde, wenn mir jemand das angetan hätte. „Man bekommt sofort Mitgefühl und denkt: ‚Das sollte unbedingt gestoppt werden‘.“ Internationaler Frauentag: bahnbrechende Persönlichkeiten der Geschichte Alle anzeigen 17 1 /17 Internationaler Frauentag: bahnbrechende Persönlichkeiten der Geschichte Internationaler Frauentag: bahnbrechende Persönlichkeiten der Geschichte Die radikale politische Aktivistin Angela Davis spricht bei einer Demonstration in Raleigh Getty Internationaler Frauentag: bahnbrechende Persönlichkeiten der Geschichte Schlechte Bezahlung, 14-Stunden-Tage und gefährliche Arbeitsbedingungen führten 1888 zu einem Streik von rund 1400 Frauen und Mädchen in einer Streichholzfabrik in Bow, London.

Lassen Sie uns eine kleine Sache tun, die einen Unterschied machen wird. „Ich denke, das hat das Potenzial, einen Unterschied zu machen. Es wird die Welt nicht verändern, aber es wird für viele Frauen anders sein.“ Es gebe „keine Entschuldigung“, nicht zu handeln, fügte sie hinzu. Der Gesetzentwurf von Frau Hobhouse soll am 11.

8c7cfe8f	Einer von zehn Patienten, die ins Krankenhaus eingeliefert werden, leidet an einer Form von Diabetes, die mit Übergewicht und Inaktivität verbunden ist. Das Ausmaß der wachsenden Krise wurde gestern Abend offengelegt, als bekannt wurde, dass Krankenhäuser jeden Tag mit 5.000 Patienten mit Typ-2-Diabetes überschwemmt werden. Es fordert einen beispiellosen Tribut vom unter Druck stehenden NHS, da Ärzte jetzt Kinder unter neun Jahren sehen, die Hilfe benötigen. Der Grund, warum die Krankheit für den NHS so belastend ist, sind ihre verheerenden Komplikationen, zu denen Herzinfarkte, Schlaganfälle, Nierenversagen und Amputationen gehören. Die Zahlen zeigen, dass es 2018/19 4.992 Einweisungen bei Frauen im Alter von 20 bis 29 Jahren gab, verglichen mit 1.755 bei Männern. Im vergangenen Jahr gab es mehr als 1,7 Millionen Aufnahmen von Patienten mit Typ-2-Diabetes, was den NHS schätzungsweise 22 Millionen Pfund pro Tag kostete. Eine Aufnahme kann denselben Patienten mehr als einmal zählen. Die Zahl hat sich in einem Jahrzehnt verdoppelt, und letzte Nacht warnte der Leiter des NHS: „Unsere ständig wachsenden Taillen fordern einen wachsenden Tribut.“ Simon Stevens warnte, dass der „alarmierende Anstieg“ der Zulassungen auf breiter Front „vermeidbaren Druck“ ausübe unsere Krankenhäuser. Die Zahlen zeigen auch, dass es 2018/19 940 Aufnahmen mit Kindern und Jugendlichen unter 19 Jahren gab. Dazu gehörten 45 Einweisungen für Kinder unter neun Jahren – eine schockierende Statistik für eine Krankheit, die einst nur bei Erwachsenen mittleren Alters aufgetreten ist . Zwei Drittel der Typ-2-Diabetes-Einweisungen bei den unter 40-Jährigen im letzten Jahr betrafen weibliche Patienten, und es gibt Hinweise darauf, dass sie anfälliger für Komplikationen sind. Die Daten beziehen sich nur auf Patienten mit Typ-2-Diabetes, der stark mit Übergewicht und Bewegungsmangel zusammenhängt – und weitgehend vermeidbar ist. Der Grund, warum die Krankheit für den NHS so belastend ist, sind ihre verheerenden Komplikationen, zu denen Herzinfarkte, Schlaganfälle, Nierenversagen und Amputationen gehören. Die Zahlen zeigen, dass es 2018/19 4.992 Zulassungen für Frauen im Alter von 20 bis 29 Jahren gab, verglichen mit 1.755 für Männer. Hausärzte warnten auch davor, dass einige Patienten bis zu 200 Gesundheitstermine pro Jahr benötigen, um mit ihrem Zustand fertig zu werden. Im vergangenen Jahr gab es mehr als 1,7 Millionen Aufnahmen von Patienten mit Typ-2-Diabetes [Aktenfoto] Ebenso gab es 16.707 Aufnahmen für Frauen im Alter von 30 bis 39 im Vergleich zu 10.207 für Männer. Insgesamt machten Frauen im vergangenen Jahr 65 Prozent der 34.601 Zulassungen unter den unter 40-Jährigen aus. Obwohl Typ-2-Diabetes häufiger bei Männern auftritt, haben Untersuchungen gezeigt, dass Frauen einem höheren Risiko für Komplikationen ausgesetzt sind, darunter Herzerkrankungen, Nierenerkrankungen sowie Depressionen. Beunruhigenderweise zeigen die Zahlen auch, dass es 2018/19 940 Aufnahmen mit Kindern und Jugendlichen unter 19 Jahren gab. Dazu gehörten 45 Einweisungen für Kinder unter neun Jahren – eine schockierende Statistik für eine Krankheit, die einst nur bei Erwachsenen mittleren Alters auftrat. Unabhängig von ihrem Alter oder Geschlecht müssen die meisten Patienten, bei denen Typ-2-Diabetes diagnostiziert wurde, für den Rest ihres Lebens Medikamente einnehmen und regelmäßig zu Kontrolluntersuchungen gehen. Herr Stevens, Chief Executive des NHS, sagte: „Unsere ständig wachsenden Taillen fordern einen wachsenden Tribut von der Gesundheit unserer Familien und von unserem NHS, wobei dieser alarmierende Anstieg der Einweisungen den vermeidbaren Druck zeigt, den er auf Krankenhäuser ausübt. „Der NHS Long Term Plan leistet mehr als nur seinen Beitrag, mit Plänen, 200.000 Menschen pro Jahr vor der Entwicklung von Typ-2-Diabetes zu bewahren, aber die breitere Gesellschaft, einschließlich Supermärkte und Einzelhändler, muss sich im Kampf gegen die Überfüllung verstärken.“ Caroline Cerny von der Die Obesity Health Alliance, ein Zusammenschluss von 40 Organisationen, die darauf abzielen, die Fettleibigkeit zu reduzieren, sagte: „Fettleibigkeit erhöht das Risiko für Typ-2-Diabetes erheblich, und deshalb brauchen wir die Regierung, um energische Maßnahmen zum Schutz der Gesundheit von Kindern zu ergreifen, mit umfassenden Einschränkungen zur Eindämmung die unermüdliche Vermarktung und Förderung von Junk Food.“ Jeder zehnte Patient, der ins Krankenhaus eingeliefert wird, leidet an einer Form von Diabetes, die mit Übergewicht und Inaktivität in Verbindung steht. Das Ausmaß der Krise wurde gestern Abend offengelegt, als bekannt wurde, dass Krankenhäuser jeden Tag mit 5.000 Patienten mit Typ-2-Diabetes überschwemmt werden [Dateifoto] Schätzungsweise 4,7 Millionen Erwachsene und Kinder in Großbritannien leben mit Diabetes, und die Mehrheit hat Typ-2 Diese Zahl hat sich seit 1998 verdoppelt, im Einklang mit der steigenden Fettleibigkeit, und es wird angenommen, dass die Krankheit den NHS jährlich 14 Milliarden Pfund kostet. Um die Auswirkungen der Krankheit auf Krankenhäuser abzuschätzen, analysierte die Mail die Aufnahmedaten von NHS Digital für die letzten zehn Jahre. Dies ergab, dass es 2018/19 1.749.025 Einweisungen wegen Typ-2-Diabetes gab, gegenüber 1.637.565 in 2017/18 und 924.536 in 2009/10. Eine Aufnahme kann sowohl eine geplante Diabetes- als auch eine Komplikationsuntersuchung beinhalten – oder eine Notaufnahme über die Notaufnahme. Nach dem 40. Lebensjahr holen die Männer die Frauen ein und stellen einen höheren Anteil der Einweisungen bei den 50- bis 90-Jährigen. Dies liegt wahrscheinlich daran, dass Männer häufiger an Typ-2-Diabetes erkranken und die Krankheit am häufigsten im Alter von 2 bis 4 Jahren auftritt über 50. Frühere Studien haben jedoch gezeigt, dass Frauen mit Typ-2-Diabetes anfälliger für Herzerkrankungen und Schlaganfälle sind. Die Diabetiker, die den NHS 200 Mal im Jahr nutzen Von Sophie Borland, Gesundheitsredakteurin der Daily Mail Professorin Helen Stokes-Lampard sagte oben, dass Erwachsene in den „späteren Stadien“ der Erkrankung tägliche Konsultationen oder Hausbesuche erfordern Diabetes stellt eine große Belastung für den Hausarzt dar Operationen mit Patienten, die bis zu 200 NHS-Termine pro Jahr benötigen, hat ein Top-Arzt ergeben. Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard sagte, Erwachsene in den „späteren Stadien“ der Erkrankung erforderten tägliche Konsultationen oder Hausbesuche. Sie sagte, die „stetige Zunahme“ der Zahl neuer Fälle schaffe „erhebliche Probleme“ für Operationen, die bereits unter starkem Druck stehen. Die Leiterin des Royal College of GPs enthüllte auch, wie Patienten 20 Jahre früher im Leben Symptome entwickeln als bei ihrer ersten Qualifikation in den frühen 2000er Jahren. Professor Stokes-Lampard, der 52.000 Hausärzte im Vereinigten Königreich vertritt, sagte: „Jede Person, bei der eine Diagnose gestellt wird, benötigt mehrere Termine bei ihrem Hausarzt, mehrere Termine bei der Praxisschwester, Ausbildung, Lebensstil, dann beim Optiker und Fußpfleger . „In Ihrem ersten Jahr mit Diabetes haben Sie wahrscheinlich acht bis zehn gesundheitsbezogene Termine, vorausgesetzt, alles läuft nach Plan. Dann brauchen Sie für den Rest Ihres Lebens eine Überwachung mit Blutuntersuchungen, Sie werden wahrscheinlich für den Rest Ihres Lebens Medikamente brauchen. „Wenn Sie jedoch Komplikationen haben – ein Patient, dessen Kontrolle nicht gut war, sich in einem späteren Stadium befindet, muss er möglicherweise täglich in der Operation gesehen werden. „Sie könnten 200 Termine im Jahr haben oder eine Bezirkskrankenschwester, die täglich zu Ihnen nach Hause ruft. Dies ist das äußerste Ende des Spektrums.“ Diabetes stellt eine enorme Belastung für Allgemeinmediziner dar, da Patienten jährlich bis zu 200 NHS-Termine benötigen, hat ein Top-Arzt enthüllt. Hausärzte versuchen, übergewichtige Patienten dazu zu ermutigen, schlanker zu werden, um die Rate von Diabetes und anderen Gesundheitsproblemen zu senken [Aktenfoto] Hausarztpraxen stehen unter starker Belastung, da immer mehr Ärzte vorzeitig in Rente gehen oder ihre Arbeitszeit reduzieren, ohne ersetzt zu werden. Und das in einer Zeit, in der die Nachfrage nach Terminen aufgrund der alternden Bevölkerung und der zunehmenden Prävalenz von Zivilisationskrankheiten wie Diabetes steigt. Hausärzte versuchen, übergewichtige Patienten zum Abnehmen zu ermutigen, um die Rate von Diabetes und anderen Gesundheitsproblemen zu senken. Aber Professor Stokes-Lampard, die in Lichfield, Staffordshire, praktiziert, sagte, einer der schwierigsten Teile ihrer Arbeit sei es gewesen, den Eltern zu sagen, dass ihre Kinder zu dick seien und eine Diät machen müssten. Sie sagte: „Wenn ich einen sehr übergewichtigen Elternteil sehe, der ein Kind mitbringt, das in die übergewichtige Kategorie geht, ist es ein schwieriges Gespräch. „Sie stellen die Frage, ob Sie bemerkt haben, dass sie seit dem Schulbeginn zugenommen haben, wie Sie mit gesunder Ernährung zu Hause zurechtkommen, Sie lenken das Gespräch auf verschiedene Arten, um die Reaktion herauszuarbeiten und zu sehen, was sie motiviert. „Manchmal, wenn die Leute die Botschaft wirklich, wirklich nicht zu verstehen scheinen, muss man ein direkteres Gespräch führen.“ Obwohl Typ-2-Diabetes eng mit Fettleibigkeit verbunden ist, sind bestimmte Gruppen einem viel höheren Risiko ausgesetzt, darunter Menschen südasiatischer Herkunft oder die mit einer Familiengeschichte. Professor Stokes-Lampard sagte, dass einige Patienten sich so schämten, eine Krankheit „von dicken Menschen“ zu haben, dass sie sich weigerten, Medikamente einzunehmen.

6f2dd3a8	Neue Untersuchungen zeigen, dass die rücksichtslosen Ausgabenpläne von Labour jedem Steuerzahler jedes Jahr eine zusätzliche Rechnung von 2.400 Pfund einbringen könnten, wenn Jeremy Corbyn Premierminister wird. Diese Zahl – die „Kosten von Corbyn“ – entspricht einem ganzen Monatslohn für den Durchschnittsverdiener. Jeremy Corbyns Labour würde für das nächste Parlament eine Ausgabenrechnung von zusätzlichen 1,2 Billionen Pfund anhäufen. Darin enthalten sind Investitionen in Höhe von 546 Mrd. £ – für die sie aufgrund ihrer Steuerordnung Kredite aufnehmen könnten. Die verbleibenden Ressourcenausgaben in Höhe von 651 Mrd. £ müssten durch Steuermaßnahmen finanziert werden. Die Analyse der Ausgabenpläne von Labour zeigt, dass es ein schwarzes Loch in Höhe von 374 Mrd. Labour muss Steuern erheben, um den Fehlbetrag zu decken.‍ ‍ Zu den Steuern, die Corbyn’s Labour erwägt, gehören: Eine Grundsteuer. ‍Eine Umzugssteuer. Eine Schenkungssteuer. Treibstoffsteuererhöhungen und erhöhte Urlaubssteuern. ‍ Schatzkanzler Sajid Javid kommentierte: „Jeremy Corbyn plant einen rücksichtslosen Kaufrausch, für den wir alle bezahlen müssen. Er wird ein riesiges schwarzes Loch in den Finanzen der Nation öffnen und hart arbeitende Menschen werden diejenigen sein, die darunter leiden. Um seine Policen bezahlen zu können, muss er nicht nur Kredite und Schulden massiv erhöhen, sondern auch die Steuern um 2.400 Pfund pro Person erhöhen – das entspricht einem ganzen Monatsgehalt für den Durchschnittsverdiener. „Das britische Volk hat in den letzten zehn Jahren enorme Fortschritte bei der Behebung des Schadens gemacht, den uns die letzte Labour-Regierung hinterlassen hat. Wenn Jeremy Corbyn an die Macht käme, würde er all diese harte Arbeit wegwerfen. „Eine Stimme für Corbyn’s Labour ist eine Stimme für höhere Steuern und das Chaos von zwei weiteren Referenden. Nur eine vernünftige, mehrheitlich konservative Regierung wird den Brexit durchsetzen und die wirtschaftliche Planungssicherheit für Familien und Unternehmen schaffen. Wir können uns die Kosten für Corbyn einfach nicht leisten.“ ‍ Was Sie wissen müssen: John McDonnell hat die Aufnahme von Krediten zur Finanzierung der täglichen Ausgabenpläne von Labour ausgeschlossen. ‍„Die fiskalische Glaubwürdigkeitsregel von Labour erlaubt keine Kreditaufnahme für die täglichen Ausgaben. Nach unserer von führenden Ökonomen ausgearbeiteten Regel ist die Kreditaufnahme nur für langfristige Investitionen erlaubt.“ John McDonnell, Twitter, 6. Januar 2019, Link Labours tägliches schwarzes Loch bedeutet, dass jeder einzelne Steuerzahler im Vereinigten Königreich seine Einkommensteuer sehen konnte um 2.400 £ pro Jahr steigen. ‍Aufgrund ihrer eigenen Steuervorschriften darf Labour keine Kredite aufnehmen, um die 650 Milliarden Pfund an täglichen Ausgaben zu finanzieren, die sie eingegangen ist, und müsste stattdessen die Steuern erhöhen. Sie haben sich zu Einnahmensteigerungen in Höhe von 277 Mrd. £ verpflichtet, was bedeutet, dass sie eine Lücke von 374 Mrd. £ schließen müssen. Es gibt 31.199.000 Einkommensteuerzahler im Vereinigten Königreich, die jeweils über fünf Jahre zusätzliche 12.000 £ oder 2.400 £ pro Jahr zahlen müssten, um Labours Lücke jedes Jahr zu schließen HMRC, Number of Income Taxpayers, 28. Juni 2019, Link. Die durchschnittliche Person müsste 30 Tage länger arbeiten, um diese Erhöhung auszugleichen. ‍Der durchschnittliche Wochenlohn beträgt 479 £ – oder 394 £ nach Steuern nach den aktuellen Plänen. Dies entspricht etwa 78,80 £ pro Tag, also entsprechen 2.400 £ 30 Arbeitstagen. Dies basiert auf 30 Kalendertagen einschließlich Wochenenden, sodass es in Wirklichkeit mehr als sechs Wochen dauern würde, von Montag bis Freitag zu arbeiten, um ONS auszuzahlen, ASHE Table 1, 29.

August 2019, Link.‍ Das bedeutet, dass Familien zusätzlich 3.900 £ zahlen müssen an Steuern pro Jahr, um das schwarze Loch in Höhe von 374 Milliarden Pfund in Labours Ressourcenausgabenplänen zu decken. Dies entspricht jeder Familie im ganzen Land, die 75 £ pro Woche mehr an Steuern zahlt. Dies kann über die Regionen gemittelt werden, wie in der Tabelle unter dem Link HMRC, Number of Income Taxpayers, 28. Juni 2019, Link; ONS, Einnahmentabellen zu den Finanzen der Länder und Regionen des öffentlichen Sektors, 28. Mai 2019, Link. ‍ Berechnung des schwarzen Lochs von Labour:‍ Labour hat sich verpflichtet, in den nächsten fünf Jahren 1,2 Billionen Pfund auszugeben. Von dieser Gesamtsumme hat Labour Ausgabenverpflichtungen im Wert von 651 Mrd. £ eingegangen, die als tägliche Ausgaben gelten und daher nicht für The Telegraph, 10.

November 2019, auf Anfrage erhältlich.‍ Labour sagte, ihr Manifest von 2017 würde 48,6 Milliarden Pfund pro Jahr oder 243 Milliarden Pfund für ein Parlament aufbringen. Ein Teil davon umfasst jedoch Einnahmen aus der Einführung der Mehrwertsteuer auf Privatschulen, die aufgrund eines Antrags, der auf einer Labour-Konferenz verabschiedet wurde, nun Parteipolitik ist, um sie abzuschaffen. Wir gehen im Zweifelsfall von Labour aus und sind davon ausgegangen, dass dies nicht im ersten Jahr passieren würde. Daher haben wir Einnahmen in Höhe von 1,6 Mrd. £ für das erste Jahr aus diesem Link The Labour Party, Funding Britain’s Future, Mai 2017, aufgenommen. ‍Seit 2017 hat sich Labour verpflichtet, weitere Einnahmequellen im Wert von 40,5 £ einzuführen. Milliarden über fünf Jahre CRD-Analyse, 10.

Sie haben sich zu täglichen Ausgaben in Höhe von 651 Mrd. £ verpflichtet, aber nur Einnahmen im Wert von 277 Mrd. £ über einen Zeitraum von fünf Jahren angekündigt – so bleibt ein schwarzes Loch von 374 Mrd. £ CRD-Analyse, 10. November 2019, auf Anfrage erhältlich. ‍ ‍ Aus diesem Grund muss Labour mehr Steuern in Betracht ziehen, um die Lücke zu schließen:‍ Eine Grundsteuer. ‍Ein Dokument zur Arbeitspolitik forderte eine neue „progressive Grundsteuer“, die dazu führen würde, dass der durchschnittliche Haushalt bis zu 375 £ mehr an Grundsteuer zahlen würde als unter dem derzeitigen Gemeindesteuersystem. Es wird erwartet, dass dies in ganz England zusätzliche 10,2 Mrd. £ einbringen wird, verglichen mit dem derzeitigen Council Tax System, Labour Party, Land for the Many, S. 33, Juni 2019, Link; Resolution Foundation, Options for reforming property tax, März 2018, Link; neben der Analyse des Grundbuchamts, UK House Price Index Summary, März 2019, und MHCLG, Live Tables on Council Tax, März 2019 A movers’ tax. ‍In einem Grundsatzdokument der Labour Party heißt es: „Die Anwendung einer Kapitalertragssteuer auch auf den Hauptwohnsitz würde es uns ermöglichen, die Vermögensungleichheit zu begrenzen, die durch den Immobilienboom entsteht.“ Die Abschaffung der Kapitalertragssteuerbefreiung für Hauptwohnsitze würde die Eigentümer zwingen, Einkommenssteuer auf die Gewinne zu zahlen, wenn sie nach Hause ziehen – und zu einer „Doppelschlag“-Abgabe auf ihren Nachlass führen, wenn die Eigentümer sterben. Eine solche Steuer könnte 28 Milliarden Pfund pro Jahr einbringen The Labour Party, Land for the Many, S. 34. Juni 2019, Link. Eine Schenkungssteuer. ‍Dies würde für die meisten Menschen, die das Familienhaus ihrer Eltern erben, eine enorme Steuererhöhung bedeuten. Der Vorschlag von Labour sieht eine neue „Lebensgeschenksteuer“ auf Bargeld oder Häuser vor, die Einzelpersonen im Laufe ihres Lebens geschenkt werden. Dies wird voraussichtlich weitere 9,2 Milliarden £ pro Jahr einbringen. The Labour Party, Land for the Many, Juni 2019, Link. ‍Treibstoffsteuererhöhungen und erhöhte Feiertagssteuern. ‍Schattenverkehrsminister Andy McDonald sagte: „Treibstoffsteuer, eingefroren seit 2010 … Fluggaststeuer in der Luftfahrt, weitgehend eingefroren über einen ähnlichen Zeitraum … Dies ist kein vernünftiger Ansatz für die Verkehrspolitik.“ ‍Es wird erwartet, dass die Erhöhung der Treibstoffsteuer bis zu 855 Millionen £ pro Jahr einbringt; die Erhöhung der Fluggaststeuer könnte 300 Millionen Pfund pro Jahr einbringen Rede von Andy McDonald vor dem Institute for Government, 20.

2e48fffe	Von den 113 erfolgreichen Bewerbern, die heute, am 12. Januar 2017, zum Queen’s Counsel ernannt wurden, waren 31 Frauen gegenüber 25 im letzten Jahr, und 16 hatten einen BAME-Hintergrund (von 9). Darüber hinaus gehören angesehene Akademiker zu den 5 neuen Honorary Queen’s Counsel, die ebenfalls heute ernannt werden. Die Nachricht wurde von Lordkanzlerin Elizabeth Truss begrüßt, die eng mit der Rechtsbranche zusammenarbeitet, um Barrieren abzubauen und die Förderung von Talenten auf breiter Front zu verbessern, von Anwaltskanzleien bis hin zu Richtern des Obersten Gerichtshofs. Lordkanzlerin Elizabeth Truss sagte: „Ich lobe jeden der 113 Anwälte und Anwälte sowie die fünf Ehrenanwälte der Königin für ihre Ernennungen. Ich möchte, dass wir alle Talente unserer Gesellschaft nutzen, und die heutigen Ernennungen sind ein Schritt in die richtige Richtung. Die Zahl der Frauen und BAME-Kandidaten, die sich bewerben und erfolgreich sind, geht in die richtige Richtung. Es gibt noch mehr zu tun, aber meine Botschaft ist klar: Wenn Sie den Talentpool erweitern, aus dem Anwälte und Richter gezogen werden, stärken Sie das Justizsystem. Heute startet die Judicial Appointments Commission auch das neueste Einstellungsverfahren für High Court-Richter. Das Auswahlverfahren wurde so geändert, dass die umfassenderen Verdienste aller Kandidaten anerkannt werden. Zum ersten Mal öffnet es die Tür zu einem größeren Pool von „Direkteinstiegskandidaten“ – Personen, die zwar außergewöhnlich talentiert sind, aber noch keine juristische Erfahrung gesammelt haben. Hinweise für Redakteure Die Liste der Queen’s Counsel-Ernennungen von 2016 bis 2017 Die 113 Queen’s Counsel QC, auch bekannt als Silks-Ernennungen, umfasst: - 31 weibliche Bewerber der 56, die sich beworben haben; letztes Jahr waren 25 der 48 weiblichen Bewerberinnen erfolgreich – 16 der 37 Bewerberinnen, die eine andere ethnische Herkunft als weiß angegeben haben; letztes Jahr wurden 9 von 32 Bewerbern ernannt QCs werden von der Queen auf Anraten des Lordkanzlers ernannt. Sie wird ihrerseits von einem unabhängigen Auswahlgremium beraten, das jede Bewerbung entgegennimmt, prüft und Empfehlungen zur Ernennung ausspricht. Der Lordkanzler wird am 13. Februar 2017 in der Westminster Hall die Ernennungszeremonie leiten, bei der erfolgreichen Bewerbern der Rang offiziell verliehen wird.

Biografien des Honorary Queen’s Counsel Professor John Mitchell Finnis Er ist ein führender Rechtsphilosoph und Rechtswissenschaftler an der Oxford University und Notre Dame. Viele seiner ehemaligen Studenten haben später an renommierten Universitäten auf der ganzen Welt gelehrt oder an den höheren Gerichten in England und Wales und darüber hinaus gesessen. Während seiner langen und herausragenden akademischen Laufbahn an den Rechtsfakultäten von Oxford und Notre Dame hat Professor Finnis einen produktiven und unvergleichlichen Beitrag zur Rechtswissenschaft geleistet. Er ist bekannt für seine Arbeit in der Tradition des klassischen Naturrechtsdenkens, die das Studium der Rechtswissenschaften auf der ganzen Welt verändert hat. Er ist auch eine angesehene Autorität in anderen Rechtsgebieten, insbesondere Verfassungsrecht und Medizinrecht, und seine Arbeit in diesen Bereichen wurde vom Obersten Gerichtshof des Vereinigten Königreichs und vom Berufungsgericht zitiert. Professor Finnis widmet sich seit vielen Jahren dem Dienst der Rechtswissenschaft und der juristischen Ausbildung und das auf höchstem Niveau. Marcia Willis Stewart Sie ist eine bekannte Rechtsanwältin für bürgerliche Freiheiten, die seit über einem Jahrzehnt an der Spitze des öffentlichen Rechts und des Verwaltungsrechts steht. Sie war in einer Reihe von herausfordernden und wichtigen Fällen tätig, darunter die Vertretung der Familie in der Duggan-Untersuchung und die Leitung eines Teams von über 30 Anwälten, die 77 der Hillsborough-Familien vertreten. Marcia hat enorme Fähigkeiten und Engagement bewiesen und sowohl ihren Kunden als auch ihren Kollegen außergewöhnliche Hingabe und unauffällige, effektive Führung geboten. Während der Hillsborough-Untersuchungen widmete sie ihre Zeit der Unterstützung und Betreuung von Schülern der örtlichen Gemeindeschule und ermutigte sie, sich für die Untersuchungen und das Gesetz zu interessieren. Als leidenschaftliche Verfechterin von Vielfalt hat sie Arbeitsumgebungen geschaffen, die Anwälten aus marginalisierten Gemeinschaften, denen in weiten Teilen des Berufs am wenigsten Möglichkeiten geboten werden, den Zugang ermöglichen. Marcia hat eine lange Geschichte des Engagements im Freiwilligensektor und leistete als Treuhänderin Beiträge zu verschiedenen Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen, darunter Camden Women's Aid, jetzt Solace Women's Aid, wo sie über ein Jahrzehnt sowohl die Position der Vorsitzenden als auch der Schatzmeisterin innehatte. Marcia wurde 2015 zur Legal Aid Lawyer Public Law Solicitor des Jahres ernannt. Professor Surya Subedi OBE Er ist ein angesehener Akademiker, der einen großen Beitrag zum Völkerrecht und zu den Menschenrechten geleistet hat. Er hat umfassend zu Völkerrecht und Menschenrechten publiziert. Zwischen 2010 und 2015 war er fünf Jahre lang Mitglied der Beratungsgruppe für Menschenrechte des britischen Außenministers. Während seiner Amtszeit als UN-Sonderberichterstatter für Menschenrechte erstellte er 4 von den Vereinten Nationen veröffentlichte wesentliche Berichte mit Schwerpunkt auf Justiz-, Parlaments-, Wahl- und Landreformen in Kambodscha. Einige seiner Empfehlungen wurden von der Regierung umgesetzt.

22b5eb59	"Fast 99 Prozent der Covid-19-Patienten mit Vitamin-D-Mangel sterben laut einer erschreckenden Studie, die zu den zunehmenden Beweisen beiträgt, dass der „Sonnenschein“ -Nährstoff ein Coronavirus-Lebensretter sein könnte. Indonesische Forscher analysierten Krankenhausakten von 780 Personen, die positiv auf SARS-CoV-2, das Coronavirus, das Covid-19 verursacht, getestet wurden. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass 98,9 Prozent der infizierten Patienten mit Vitamin-D-Mangel – unter 20 ng/ml – starben. Bei Patienten, die genug von dem Nährstoff hatten, fiel dieser Wert jedoch auf nur 4,1 Prozent. Die Forscher warnten jedoch davor, dass die Studie nicht endgültig sei, da die Patienten mit hohen Vitamin-D-Spiegeln gesünder und jünger seien. Es kommt daher, dass Gesundheitschefs dringend die Verwendung von Vitamin D als Lebensretter für Coronaviren prüfen, wobei mehrere Studien darauf hindeuten, dass Covid-19-Patienten mit weitaus höherer Wahrscheinlichkeit sterben, wenn sie einen Mangel haben. Eine Untersuchung – durchgeführt von der Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge – ergab, dass europäische Länder mit niedrigeren Vitamin-D-Spiegeln deutlich mehr Pandemie-Opfer hatten. Das National Institute for Health and Care Excellence führt eine „Rapid Evidence Review“ zu diesem Thema durch – und die Veröffentlichung wird bereits für nächste Woche erwartet. Eine abgebildete Grafik zeigt, wie die Sterblichkeitsrate von Covid-19 durch den Vitamin-D-Spiegel beeinflusst wird. Die Hauptquelle für Vitamin D ist für die meisten Menschen das Tageslicht – der Körper kann den Nährstoff selbst versorgen, wenn die Haut UV-Licht ausgesetzt ist Strahlen stockbild Forscher der University of East Anglia erstellten im Mai ein Korrelationsdiagramm, das die Beziehung zwischen den Vitamin-D-Spiegeln unten, gemessen in nmol/l, im Vergleich zu den Infektionszahlen des Coronavirus zeigt. Länder mit niedrigem Vitamin-D-Spiegel haben tendenziell die höchsten Fallraten pro Million. Sie fanden heraus, dass Daten in einem Bericht von Public Health England zeigten, dass die Sterblichkeitsrate – die Zahl der Menschen, die mit dem Coronavirus sterben, von jeweils 100.000 Menschen – für Schwarze erheblich höher war Männer als andere Gruppe. Das Risiko für schwarze Frauen, Menschen asiatischer Abstammung und Menschen gemischter Rassen war ebenfalls höher als für weiße Menschen beiderlei Geschlechts. Menschen mit nicht weißer Haut haben auch ein höheres Risiko für einen Vitamin-D-Mangel, weil sie länger brauchen, um es aus dem Sonnenlicht zu schaffen. Die indonesische Studie wurde im Gegensatz zu den meisten Covid-19-Forschungen nicht mit Experten einer Universität in Verbindung gebracht. Alle fünf Forscher, angeführt von Prabowo Raharusuna, wurden als „unabhängig“ aufgeführt. Einzelheiten zu ihren wissenschaftlichen Hintergründen wurden in dem Papier nicht genannt. Die im April veröffentlichte Studie muss noch von anderen Wissenschaftlern begutachtet werden, ein Prozess, der häufig Mängel in Studien aufdeckt. Das Team fand heraus, dass Patienten mit Vitamin-D-Mangel zehnmal häufiger starben, wenn Alter, Geschlecht und Komorbiditäten berücksichtigt wurden. Sie schrieben in der Zeitung: „Bei der Kontrolle von Alter, Geschlecht und Komorbidität ist der Vitamin-D-Status stark mit dem Sterblichkeitsergebnis von Covid-19-Fällen verbunden.“ Und sie forderten randomisierte kontrollierte Studien – die als Goldstandard der wissenschaftlichen Forschung gelten – um zu beweisen, ob Vitamin D ein Lebensretter sein kann. Einem von fünf britischen Erwachsenen und einem von sechs Kindern fehlt es an Vitamin D, was auf schlechte Ernährung, einen Lebensstil in Innenräumen und mangelnden Sonnenschein zurückzuführen ist. Experten schätzen, dass weltweit etwa 1 Milliarde Menschen einen Vitaminmangel aufweisen, wobei die Zahlen als „globales Problem der öffentlichen Gesundheit“ beschrieben wurden. Einige Wissenschaftler befürchten, dass der Lockdown und das monatelange Leben in Innenräumen die Werte noch weiter gesenkt haben. Einige ethnische Gruppen sind tendenziell einem höheren Risiko ausgesetzt, da ihre Haut das Vitamin als Reaktion auf Sonnenlicht weniger bilden kann. Auch ältere Menschen sind gefährdet, weil der Körper mit zunehmendem Alter weniger effizient das Vitamin produziert. Public Health England arbeitet mit NICE an der Überprüfung und hat den Wissenschaftlichen Beratungsausschuss für Ernährung gebeten, einen separaten Bericht zu erstellen. In anderen Entwicklungen in der Pandemie: VITAMIN-D-MANGEL KÖNNTE DAS TODESRISIKO VON COVID-19 FÜR BAME-MENSCHEN ERHÖHEN BAME-Menschen könnten einem höheren Risiko ausgesetzt sein, an dem Coronavirus zu sterben, weil sie mit größerer Wahrscheinlichkeit einen Vitamin-D-Mangel haben, behaupten Wissenschaftler. Die Pandemie sieht eine höhere Rate von Menschen mit schwarzem, asiatischem und ethnischem Minderheitenhintergrund, die sterben, wenn sie sich mit dem Coronavirus infizieren. Die Gründe sind noch unbekannt und werden wahrscheinlich zahlreich und kompliziert sein. Einige Experten glauben jedoch, dass ein Mangel an Vitamin D eine Rolle spielen könnte. Menschen mit dunklerer Haut müssen mehr Zeit im Sonnenlicht verbringen, um die gleiche Menge an Vitamin D aufzunehmen wie Menschen mit hellerer Haut. Aus diesem Grund schlägt der NHS vor, dass Menschen mit afrikanischem, afrikanisch-karibischem oder südasiatischem Hintergrund davon profitieren könnten, das ganze Jahr über eine tägliche Nahrungsergänzung einzunehmen. Vitamin D kann eine schützende Wirkung gegen schweres Coronavirus haben, indem es das Immunsystem reguliert, und Mängel davon wurden mit anderen Atemwegsviren in Verbindung gebracht. Die größte Studie zur Untersuchung des Zusammenhangs zwischen BAME, Covid-19 und Vitamin D in einer britischen Bevölkerung fand jedoch keinen Beweis. William Henley, Professor für medizinische Statistik an der University of Exeter, sagte gegenüber MailOnline, der Link sei es wert, untersucht zu werden. Er sagte: „Vorläufige Untersuchungen legen nahe, dass sich der Vitamin-D-Spiegel auch auf das Risiko von Menschen auswirken kann, die an schweren COVID-19-Infektionen leiden. „In Großbritannien und den nordeuropäischen Breiten ist ein Vitamin-D-Mangel ein Problem für die öffentliche Gesundheit, da die ultraviolette B-UVB-Strahlung in den Wintermonaten von unzureichender Intensität für die Vitamin-D-Synthese ist. ""Dies ist ein besonderes Problem für Menschen mit dunkler Hautfarbe, wie Menschen mit afrikanischer, afrikanisch-karibischer oder südasiatischer Herkunft, die länger in der Sonne verbringen müssen, um die gleiche Menge an Vitamin D zu produzieren wie jemand mit hellerer Haut."" Anzeige Die Dreifachsperre zum Schutz der Renten soll ausgesetzt werden; Boris Johnson sagte Tory-Abgeordneten, er wolle die Zwei-Meter-Regel zur sozialen Distanzierung aufgeben; Hausärzte äußerten sich besorgt darüber, dass die Sperrung zu schnell gelockert wurde; Kulturminister Oliver Dowden sagte, es sei „außergewöhnlich schwierig“ für die Wiedereröffnung der Theater; Die Chefs von 50 Brauereien und Kneipenketten forderten bis Freitag eine Bestätigung, wann sie den Handel wieder aufnehmen können; Mehr als 1.600 Kinderärzte forderten einen klaren Plan, um Kinder wieder in die Schule zu bringen; Experten warnten davor, dass es Monate dauern würde, bis der Rückstand bei verpassten Gebärmutterhalskrebs-Untersuchungen abgebaut wäre; Gesundheitswächter sollen Berichten nachgehen, dass Patienten mit Covid-19 in Pflegeheime entlassen wurden; Aktualisierte Ratschläge für 2,2 Millionen Menschen, die in England abgeschirmt sind, werden bald gegeben; Der Fußball kehrte nach 100 Tagen Abwesenheit endlich zurück. Vitamin-D-Tabletten sind extrem billig – sie kosten nur 3 Pence pro Tag – und Public Health England hat im April Leitlinien herausgegeben, in denen jedem empfohlen wird, die Nahrungsergänzungsmittel einzunehmen. Eine von Professor Adrian Martineau von der Queen Mary University in London geleitete Studie untersucht, wie bestimmte Lebensstilfaktoren – einschließlich des Vitamin-D-Spiegels – die Anfälligkeit für das Virus beeinflussen. „Vitamin D könnte fast als Designerdroge betrachtet werden, die dem Körper hilft, virale Atemwegsinfektionen zu bewältigen“, sagte er gestern Abend gegenüber The Guardian. Eine Überprüfung der University of Surrey, die letzten Monat im British Medical Journal veröffentlicht wurde, stellte fest, dass Vitamin D als Teil eines gesunden Lebensstils, aber nicht als „Wundermittel“ angesehen werden sollte – da die Beweise noch nicht eindeutig waren. Dr. Lee Smith, der die Studie von Anglia Ruskin leitete, sagte: „Es hat sich gezeigt, dass es vor akuten Atemwegsinfektionen schützt, und ältere Erwachsene, die Gruppe mit dem größten Vitamin-D-Mangel, sind auch am stärksten von Covid-19 betroffen. Eine frühere Studie ergab, dass 75 Prozent der Menschen in Einrichtungen wie Krankenhäusern und Pflegeheimen einen schweren Vitamin-D-Mangel aufwiesen.' Ein Sprecher von Public Health England sagte: „NICE arbeitet mit Unterstützung von Public Health England an einer schnellen Zusammenfassung der Beweise zu Vitamin D im Zusammenhang mit Covid-19. Dieser Bericht wird zu gegebener Zeit veröffentlicht.' Der NHS sagt, dass der allgemeine Konsens darin besteht, dass Werte von unter 25 nmol / l – das Äquivalent von 10 ng / ml – im Blut auf einen Vitamin-D-Mangel hinweisen. Es wird angenommen, dass dies der Einnahme von etwa 10 Mikrogramm Vitamin D pro Tag entspricht. Das Institute of Medicine – ein US-Gesundheitsberatungsgremium – gibt an, dass Werte unter 20 ng/ml 50 nmol/L ein Mangel sind. Hohe Dosen von Vitamin D können gefährlich sein, wobei alles über 100 Mikrogramm nur unter ärztlicher Aufsicht eingenommen werden darf.

991b2922	Nachwuchsärzte wurden von Gesundheitsminister Jeremy Hunt aufgefordert, an den Verhandlungstisch zurückzukehren, der ihren 24-Stunden-Streik in England als völlig unnötig bezeichnete. Laut NHS England hatten sich etwa 10.000 Nachwuchsärzte von 26.000, die für die Tagschicht vorgesehen waren, zum Dienst gemeldet. Tausende Routineoperationen wurden während des Streiks aus Protest gegen einen vorgeschlagenen neuen Vertrag abgesagt. Die BMA sagte, der Streik sei eine klare Botschaft an die Regierung. Wir bedauern das Ausmaß der verursachten Unterbrechung zutiefst, aber dies ist ein Kampf um die langfristige Sicherheit der Patienten und des Berufslebens der jungen Ärzte, sagte Dr. Johann Malawana, Vorsitzender des Nachwuchsärzteausschusses der British Medical Association BMA. Er sagte, die Nachwuchsärzte hätten kein Vertrauen in den neuen Vertrag. NHS England entschuldigte sich bei den betroffenen Patienten und sagte, dass Trusts versuchen würden, abgesagte Termine und Operationen so schnell wie möglich zu verschieben. „Kaum überraschend“ Der Streik, der um 08:00 Uhr GMT begann, findet statt, nachdem die Gespräche zwischen der Gewerkschaft und der Regierung keine Einigung über den vorgeschlagenen neuen Vertrag erzielten. Das BMA ist besorgt über die Bezahlung von Wochenendarbeit, den beruflichen Aufstieg und Schutzmaßnahmen zum Schutz der Ärzte vor Überarbeitung. Die Minister haben jedoch argumentiert, dass die derzeitigen Regelungen veraltet sind und Änderungen erforderlich sind, um die Versorgungsstandards am Wochenende zu verbessern. MedienunterschriftEmily Rogers sollte operiert werden, wurde aber wegen des Streiks abgesagt MedienunterschriftBerater: Wir werden alles tun, um sicherzustellen, dass die Patienten sicher sind NHS England sagte, dass am Dienstag mehr als 3.300 Operationen abgesagt wurden – etwa eine von 10 von denen geplant. Mehrere hundert weitere Betriebe wurden in den Tagen vor und nach dem Streik beeinträchtigt. Emily Rogers aus Cheltenham sagte der BBC, sie hätte sich einer Operation unterziehen müssen, um eine neue Ernährungssonde einzuführen, was vier Monate gedauert habe. Ich dachte, Ärzte seien weniger wegen des Geldwerts in [ihren Beruf] eingestiegen, als vielmehr weil es lohnend sei, sagte sie.

Assistenzärzte, die den Arbeitskampf unterstützen, leisten während der 24-Stunden-Periode nur Notfallversorgung. Der BBC-Gesundheitskorrespondent Nick Triggle sagte, es sei angenommen worden, dass viele der 10.000 erschienenen Ärzte Mediziner waren, die sich bereit erklärt hatten, für die Notfallversorgung zu arbeiten, obwohl einige Tausend wahrscheinlich auch Ärzte waren, die keine Mitglieder der BMA waren und nicht teilnahmen im Streik. Das BMA sagte: Da wir Nachwuchsärzte, die die Notfallversorgung abdecken würden, gebeten haben, heute zur Arbeit zu gehen, ist es kaum verwunderlich, dass sie dies zusammen mit denen getan haben, die nicht Mitglieder des BMA sind. line Die Sandwell-Krankenhaus-Saga Ein Demonstrant hält ein Tablett mit geschmückten Kuchen bei einem Protest junger Ärzte vor dem Frimley Park Krankenhaus in Frimley im Südwesten Londons Linien mit streikenden Nachwuchsärzten, mit Ausnahme von Schichten für dringende und Notfallarbeiten. Aber das Verständnis brach im Sandwell Hospital in den West Midlands eindeutig zusammen. Der Trust schrieb in einem Brief vom 11. Januar an örtliche Nachwuchsärzte, dass sie alle wegen eines internen Vorfalls arbeiten müssten und dass mit einer hohen Patientennachfrage gerechnet werde. Im Rahmen einer Vereinbarung mit dem BMA können Krankenhäuser bei lebensbedrohlichen Notfallszenarien streikende Ärzte zurückrufen. Aber die BMA argumentierte, Sandwell habe nicht im Einklang mit der Vereinbarung gehandelt und wies die Mitglieder daher an, dem Aufruf der Krankenhausleitung nicht Folge zu leisten. Eine peinliche Pattsituation folgte, nachdem eine Handvoll wieder an die Arbeit zurückgekehrt war. Am späten Nachmittag stellte das Krankenhaus seinen Hilferuf ein und sagte, die Dinge seien unter Kontrolle. Es war ein ominöses Beispiel dafür, was in der gegenwärtig angespannten Atmosphäre rund um den Streit schief gehen könnte. Line Herr Hunt sagte, die Zahl derer, die eine Arbeit aufgenommen hätten, zeige die Werte der überwiegenden Mehrheit der jungen Ärzte. Wir haben einige Meinungsverschiedenheiten mit dem BMA über die Bezahlung. Aber wir alle wollen jedem Patienten, der den NHS nutzt, jeden Tag der Woche die gleiche hochwertige Versorgung versprechen, sagte er.

Das kann nicht akzeptabel sein. Schattengesundheitsministerin Heidi Alexander sagte, der Umgang der Regierung mit dem Streik sei völlig chaotisch gewesen. Niemand wollte Arbeitskampfmaßnahmen sehen, am wenigsten die jungen Ärzte, aber wir verstehen, warum sie das Gefühl haben, keine andere Wahl zu haben, sagte sie. line BMA badgeimage copyrightPresseverband Worum geht es in dem Streit? Der Streit zwischen Ärzten in der Ausbildung und der Regierung geht um einen neuen Vertrag Die Gespräche brachen 2014 zusammen, aber der Streit ist seit dem Sommer eskaliert, nachdem die Minister erklärt hatten, sie würden den Deal durchsetzen. Die Minister boten den Ärzten letztes Jahr eine Erhöhung der Grundvergütung um 11 % an, aber das war es nicht wurde durch Beschränkungen für andere Elemente des Gehaltspakets ausgeglichen, einschließlich Zahlungen für unsoziale Stunden – sie haben behauptet, dass es kein zusätzliches Geld für die Bezahlung von Juniorärzten gibt Überstunden werden geschwächt Die Gewerkschaft wählte ihre Mitglieder im Herbst, und 98 % der Stimmberechtigten unterstützten Streiks. Die Gespräche wurden im Dezember wieder aufgenommen, was dazu führte, dass drei Tage lang Streiks abgesagt wurden, aber bisher gescheitert sind um einen Durchbruch zu erreichen, weshalb Streiks stattfinden. Für Dienstag, den 26. Januar, ist ein 48-stündiger Streik angesetzt - es wird wieder Notversorgung angeboten. Ein Vollstreik j Für Mittwoch, den 10. Februar, ist ein Streik der Unior-Ärzte geplant – Notversorgung wird nicht bereitgestellt. Die Gespräche sind noch nicht abgeschlossen, und die beiden Seiten werden voraussichtlich noch in dieser Woche an einen Tisch kommen. Wie ist Ihr Job im Vergleich? Ein Tag im Leben eines Assistenzarztes Was Patienten wissen müssen Antworten auf Ihre Streikfragen Die Lehren aus dem Ärztestreik von 1975 Viele unterstützen streikende Ärzte – Umfrageergebnisse Am Dienstagmorgen befahlen die Chefs des Sandwell Hospitals in West Bromwich Assistenzärzten, wieder an die Arbeit zu gehen nachdem er aufgrund einer sehr hohen Anzahl von Aufnahmen einen schwerwiegenden Vorfall gemeldet hatte, dieser Antrag jedoch später zurückgezogen wurde. Das BMA hatte sich geweigert, dem Antrag zuzustimmen, mit dem Argument, es sei nicht klar, ob die Situation als schwerwiegender Vorfall einzustufen sei. Die Zahl, die wir sicher entlassen konnten, ist gestiegen, so dass die Dienste heute Abend und morgen sicher sind, sagte eine Krankenhaussprecherin später. Anne Rainsberry vom NHS England entschuldigte sich bei allen betroffenen Patienten in England.

NHS-Trusts arbeiten jetzt hart daran, abgesagte Tests, Termine und Operationen so schnell wie möglich neu zu planen. Die Patients Association, eine unabhängige Gesundheitsorganisation, forderte beide Seiten auf, die Gespräche fortzusetzen. Jeder neue Vertrag muss für Ärzte faire Konditionen bieten und sie schützen. Junge Ärzte sind das Rückgrat des NHS, und es ist von entscheidender Bedeutung, dass sie in der Lage sind, die sichere und wirksame Versorgung zu gewährleisten, die Patienten benötigen, fügte er hinzu.

c46da247	Laut einer neu veröffentlichten Studie wird die Mehrheit der britischen Absolventen in Jobs gezwungen, die ihre Talente nicht erfordern. Untersuchungen für das CIPD Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, das Personalmanager vertritt, zeigen, dass 58,8 Prozent der britischen Absolventen in Jobs ohne Abschluss gelandet sind – eine Zahl, die nur von Griechenland und Estland übertroffen wird. Den Zahlen zufolge hat etwa jeder Zwölfte derjenigen, die in gering qualifizierten Berufen arbeiten – etwa in Cafés, Bars, Callcentern und im Front of House bei Veranstaltungen im Gastgewerbe – einen Hochschulabschluss. Die Untersuchung zeigt auch, dass das Vereinigte Königreich die zweithöchste Abschlussquote unter den westlichen OECD-Staaten hat – hinter Island. Es zeigt, dass es eine Abschlussquote von 54 Prozent hat. Deutschland hat dagegen nur eine Quote von 31 Prozent. Sie kommt zu dem Schluss, dass das Wachstum der Absolventen in den meisten OECD-Ländern „das Wachstum der vom Arbeitsmarkt geschaffenen hochqualifizierten Arbeitsplätze deutlich übertrifft“. Es fügt jedoch hinzu, dass der Trend „in Großbritannien besonders ausgeprägt“ sei. „Die Annahme, dass wir zu einer produktiveren, höherwertigen und höher qualifizierten Wirtschaft übergehen werden, indem wir einfach das Förderband der Absolventen erhöhen, hat sich als falsch erwiesen“, sagte Peter Cheese, Geschäftsführer des CIPD. Stattdessen haben Arbeitgeber begonnen, Abschlüsse als bestimmenden Faktor bei der Einstellung von Stellen zu verwenden, die traditionell keine Hochschulabsolventen waren.

Lesen Sie unsere Datenschutzerklärung „Viele Absolventen ersetzen einfach Nicht-Absolventen in weniger anspruchsvollen Jobs oder treten in Jobs ein, in denen die Nachfrage nach Absolventenqualifikationen nicht vorhanden oder rückläufig ist“, heißt es in dem Bericht. „Dieser Trend hat sich besonders auf Berufe ausgewirkt, in denen die Ausbildung von historischer Bedeutung war, wie Baugewerbe und Fertigung.“ Die Ergebnisse des Berichts gehen hervor, da britische Universitäten in diesem Herbst eine Rekordzahl von Absolventen einschreiben werden, nachdem die Regierung beschlossen hat, die Obergrenze für die Anzahl der Studenten, die Universitäten einstellen können, aufzuheben. Etwa einer von zwölf Menschen, die in Großbritannien in gering qualifizierten Berufen arbeiten, sind Absolventen Getty Getty Images Das, gepaart mit Tausenden von Studenten, die darauf abzielen, die Entscheidung der Regierung zu übertreffen, Unterhaltsstipendien ab dem nächsten September zu streichen, indem sie auf Lückenjahre verzichten, bedeutet die Anzahl der Rekruten zu Universitäten wird das Allzeithoch des letzten Jahres von einer halben Million übertreffen. Zahlen, die von UCAS, dem Zulassungsdienst für Universitäten und Hochschulen, veröffentlicht wurden, zeigten, dass sich in diesem Jahr bereits 461 120 für Universitätskurse eingeschrieben hatten – ein Anstieg von drei Prozent gegenüber dem gleichen Zeitpunkt im Vorjahr. Davon seien 34.000 über das Clearingsystem akzeptiert worden - eine Steigerung um sechs Prozent gegenüber dem Rekordjahr 2016. Darüber hinaus waren 5.020 von ihnen verspätete Antragsteller – was bedeutet, dass sie sich nach der Haushaltsentscheidung von Bundeskanzler George Osborne, Wartungszuschüsse abzuschaffen, hätten entscheiden können, ihre Meinung zu ändern. Der Anstieg der Studentenzahlen wird die Befürchtung schüren, dass immer mehr Studenten ihre Kredite nicht zurückzahlen können, wenn immer mehr Studenten für schlechter bezahlte Jobs rekrutiert werden. Derzeit müssen sie nur zahlen, wenn sie 21.000 Pfund pro Jahr verdienen und die Schulden nach 30 Jahren abgeschrieben sind. „Diese Situation ist unhaltbar, da die Regierung schätzt, dass 45 Prozent der Hochschulabsolventen nicht genug verdienen werden, um ihre Studiendarlehen zurückzuzahlen“, sagte Herr Cheese. Die Zahl ist die Schätzung, an der die Regierung arbeitet. „Die Bemühungen müssen verstärkt werden, um sicherzustellen, dass junge Menschen, die nach Erhalt ihrer GCSE- und Abiturergebnisse eine Wahl treffen, Zugang zu qualitativ hochwertigen Berufsinformationen, Beratung und Anleitung haben, damit sie fundiertere Entscheidungen treffen können“, fügte er hinzu. Der Bericht deckt sich auch mit weiteren heute Morgen veröffentlichten Untersuchungen, die einen gravierenden Mangel an Auszubildenden in der britischen Bauindustrie zeigen, wobei 66 Prozent der kleinen Bauunternehmen zugeben, dass sie gezwungen waren, Neuaufträge abzulehnen, weil sie einfach nicht die Mitarbeiter haben, um sie zu tragen aus. Fast die Hälfte musste Arbeiten an andere Firmen auslagern, anstatt sie unvollendet zu lassen. Mehr ansehen Die Studie der Federation of Master Builders macht Teenager dafür verantwortlich, dass sie unter Druck stehen, ihre Vollzeitausbildung fortzusetzen, und Lehrer und Freunde der Familie beeinflussen, mehr akademische Ziele zu verfolgen. Der CIPD-Bericht, der am Tag veröffentlicht wird, bevor mehr als eine halbe Million Teenager ihre GCSE-Ergebnisse erhielten, fordert die Minister auf, ihre Anstrengungen zu verstärken, um die Qualität und Quantität der Lehrlingsausbildung zu erhöhen, um die Lücken des Qualifikationsmangels zu schließen. Sie fordert Arbeitgeber dringend auf, die Einstellungspraktiken zu überprüfen, um zu vermeiden, dass Abschlüsse als Screening-Prozess für Stellen verwendet werden, die keine Universitätsausbildung erfordern. Am Donnerstag wird sich die Erfolgsquote von 98,5 Prozent voraussichtlich kaum ändern, und die 68,8 Prozent, die letztes Jahr fünf oder mehr Bestnote A * bis C bestanden haben. Die Prüfungsaufsichtsbehörde Ofqual hat bereits angedeutet, dass es eine weitere Abweichung bei den Zahlen geben wird, die akademische Kernfächer wie Mathematik, Englisch, Naturwissenschaften, Geschichte und Geographie belegen. Es wird erwartet, dass die Zahlen, die moderne Fremdsprachen belegen, ungefähr gleich bleiben. Eine Sprecherin des Ministeriums für Wirtschaft, Innovation und Qualifikationen sagte: „Wir bieten die richtige Mischung aus Studienplätzen und Ausbildungsplätzen, um sicherzustellen, dass mehr Menschen die Möglichkeit haben, ihre Karriere voranzutreiben, und Unternehmen die Fähigkeiten erhalten, die sie für ihr Wachstum benötigen. „Die Nachfrage nach Hochschulbildung bleibt stark und Absolventen genießen eine Prämie, die ihren Wert für Arbeitgeber widerspiegelt.“ Fallstudie Will Swabrick, 21, genoss eine bemerkenswerte akademische Laufbahn an der University of Warwick, die er im Sommer dieses Jahres mit einem erstklassigen Abschluss in Geschichte abschloss. Will Swabrick sicherte sich nach Abschluss seines Geschichtsstudiums einen Job im Technologiesektor. Trotz dieses akademischen Erfolgs hat er, wie viele seiner Kollegen, eine Beschäftigung in einem völlig anderen Sektor aufgenommen. Will sicherte sich gleich nach seinem Abschluss einen Job im Technologiesektor. Er arbeitet jetzt für die Spieleentwicklungsfirma Exient mit Sitz in Leamington Spa, wo er gesteht, dass er seinen Abschluss selten nutzt. „Abgesehen von sehr allgemeinen, übertragbaren Fähigkeiten hat mein Abschluss in meinem derzeitigen Job leider keine wirkliche Rolle gespielt“, sagte er. „Obwohl ich gerne Geschichte studiert habe, ist ihr praktischer Nutzen in meiner jetzigen Funktion praktisch nicht existent.“ Will beschäftigt sich nicht mehr mit Marx und Foucault und verbringt seine Tage damit, über die Entwicklung von Konsolen-, Handheld- und Handyspielen nachzudenken. Findet er, dass der Abschluss ein gutes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis bietet? „Noch nicht, aber vielleicht irgendwann auf längere Sicht.“ Seine Entscheidung, Geschichte zu studieren, bereut er nicht, achtet aber jetzt mehr auf die nicht-akademischen Aspekte der Universitätsausbildung wie außerschulische Aktivitäten und Arbeitgebernetzwerke. Er wünschte, seine Universität hätte mehr praktische und praktische Arbeitsunterstützung bereitgestellt, und sagt, dass diese Unterstützung während seines Studiums nicht ausreichte. „Die Universität hat ihr Bestes mit E-Mails und gelegentlichen Gesprächen versucht, aber die Erfahrung in der realen Welt hätte besser sein können.“ Er schlägt vor, dass die Universitäten Beschäftigungsfähigkeitssitzungen von Beginn des Studiengangs an in den Lehrplan einbauen und den Zugang zu Arbeitgeberinformationen leichter verfügbar machen könnten. Er rät zukünftigen Absolventen, mehr Wert auf Teilzeitarbeit und Berufserfahrung zu legen, um einen erfolgreichen Lebenslauf aufzubauen. „Ich hatte während meines Studiums einen Job und bin mir sicher, dass mir das geholfen hat, meine jetzige Anstellung zu sichern.“ Harvey-Tag	Die Mehrheit der britischen Absolventen wird laut Studie zu einer Arbeit ohne Abschluss gezwungen	partially false
b0ba5e99	Großbritannien zahlt eine Rechnung in Höhe von 36 Millionen Pfund für die Schließung des Dschungel-Migrantenlagers in Calais. Innenministerin Amber Rudd sagte, Großbritannien werde helfen, die am Montag begonnene Evakuierung und Maßnahmen zur Schließung des Standorts zu bezahlen. Großbritannien hat bereits 80 Millionen Pfund zugesagt, um private Sicherheitsfirmen drei Jahre lang für Patrouillenhäfen in Nordfrankreich zu bezahlen. Scrollen Sie nach unten für das Video Mehr als 2.000 Migranten wurden am Montag aus dem Dschungel verlegt, aber viele weitere bleiben abgebildet, und es gibt Befürchtungen, dass sich ein Hardcore weigern wird, sich zu rühren. um blinde Passagiere daran zu hindern, sich über den Kanal zu schleichen. Dies bedeutet, dass britische Steuerzahler mit einer Gesamtrechnung von 118 Millionen Pfund konfrontiert sind, um den Jungle-Standort und die französischen Häfen in den nächsten drei Jahren zu sichern, obwohl Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen davor warnen, dass viele Migranten unweigerlich zurückkehren werden. Auch der Spitzenkandidat der französischen Präsidentschaftswahlen, Alain Juppé, hat damit gedroht, den Le-Touquet-Deal zu zerreißen, der es Großbritannien erlaubt, Grenzkontrollen in Frankreich durchzuführen. Die linke Amber Rudd ist bereit, Frankreich 118 Millionen Pfund zu geben, um das Migrantenchaos zu beseitigen und die Grenzen zu sichern, aber Alain Juppé will mit einem Unterstützer Großbritanniens Recht entziehen, Grenzkontrollen auf der französischen Seite der Grenze durchzuführen. Die französischen Behörden begannen schließlich Evakuierung des provisorischen Dschungelcamps vor seinem Abriss, der heute beginnen sollte. Die ersten 2.000 Migranten wurden in provisorische Unterbringungszentren in ganz Frankreich evakuiert. Aber in einer Reihe von Entwicklungen: Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen warnten Tausende weitere Migranten, die sich in den kommenden Tagen weigern könnten, zu gehen, weil sie verzweifelt versuchen, Großbritannien zu erreichen; Hunderte versammelten sich zu Protesten, riefen „UK, UK, UK“ und schworen, einen neuen Dschungel zu bauen; Andere schworen, dass sie nach Calais zurückkehren würden, wenn sie umgesiedelt würden, und die illegalen Bemühungen zur Überquerung des Ärmelkanals verstärken würden; Die britische Polizei beteiligte sich an der Suche, um bis zu 200 britische Anarchisten zu identifizieren, die die Absicht hatten, die Proteste im Lager anzuheizen; Bis zu 70 junge männliche Flüchtlinge kamen in einem Herrenhaus aus dem 17. Jahrhundert in Devon an; Frankreich forderte Großbritannien auf, die Überstellung von Flüchtlingskindern vorübergehend auszusetzen. In einer dringenden Erklärung an das Unterhaus sagte Miss Rudd, die Verantwortung für Calais liege bei der französischen Regierung, bestand jedoch darauf, dass Grenzkontrollen zwischen den beiden Ländern für die Sicherheit Großbritanniens von entscheidender Bedeutung seien. Sie sagte: „Die britische Regierung wird bis zu 36 Millionen Pfund beitragen, um die Sicherheit dieser Kontrollen aufrechtzuerhalten, die Lagerräumung zu unterstützen und langfristig sicherzustellen, dass das Lager geschlossen bleibt. Diese Mittel werden auch verwendet, um die Sicherheit von Kindern in Frankreich zu gewährleisten. Ein junger Migrant radelt am Montagabend durch die Überreste des Lagers. Die meisten von denen, die sich noch im Dschungel befinden, sind junge Männer, hauptsächlich aus Afrika „Dieser Beitrag wird nicht bedingungslos geleistet, und wir werden weiterhin mit der französischen Regierung zusammenarbeiten, um sicherzustellen, dass die Räumungsoperation vollständig und dauerhaft ist“, sagte der Innenminister gegenüber britischen Beamten hatten erst letzte Woche Zugang zum Lager, um mit der Befragung von Kindern zu beginnen. Großbritannien könne nicht mit der Überstellung unbegleiteter Kinder beginnen, bis es die Erlaubnis von Frankreich habe, die erst kürzlich erteilt wurde, sagte sie. Aber in Calais sagten Migranten, sie würden einen neuen Dschungel bauen, als Busse begannen, Hunderte von hauptsächlich sudanesischen und eritreischen Männern zu provisorischen Unterkünften in ganz Frankreich zu bringen. Ein Migrant aus Äthiopiens verfolgtem Oromo-Stamm umarmt einen Freund, als er heute den Dschungel verlässt. Viele gingen freiwillig, aber andere sagten, sie würden „lieber sterben“, als ihre Träume, Großbritannien zu erreichen, aufgeben. Es kam zu Rangeleien, als eine schlecht geführte Gruppe von Migranten von der französischen Bereitschaftspolizei zusammengepfercht wurde, während sie auf ihre Abfertigung warteten. Als die Dämmerung hereinbrach, fanden Proteste von denen statt, die nicht gehen wollten, die „UK, UK, UK!“ skandierten, und Feuer wüteten im Lager, als behauptet wurde, Migranten hätten ein Gebiet in Brand gesteckt, das von britischen Wohltätigkeitsarbeitern als Stützpunkt genutzt wurde. Die Bereitschaftspolizei war in Bereitschaft, da befürchtet wurde, dass bis zu 200 Anarchisten der britischen Gruppe No Borders am Wochenende in das Lager eingedrungen waren und Gewalt vorhatten. Ein 16-jähriger Migrant aus Äthiopien weint, während er darauf wartet, sich in einem Bearbeitungszentrum im Dschungel in der Nähe von Calais zu registrieren. Ein Hubschrauber flog über ihn hinweg und zwei spezialisierte „Spotter“-Beamte der Metropolitan Police schlossen sich ihren französischen Kollegen an, um bei der Suche nach Verdächtigen zu helfen. Viele Migranten sagten der Daily Mail, die Schließung des Lagers bedeute, dass sie ihre Anstrengungen zur Überquerung des Ärmelkanals mit allen erforderlichen Mitteln verstärken würden. Imran Ali, 20, aus Afghanistan, sagte: „Wir müssen nach Großbritannien. Wenn ich sterbe, ist das kein Problem. Ich würde lieber sterben, als hier zu bleiben. In Frankreich mögen sie keine Flüchtlinge. Sie behandeln Flüchtlinge wie Hunde.“ Ein anderer Mann, der aus Afghanistan floh, gab zu, dass mehrere seiner Freunde in den Zwanzigern versucht hatten, sich als Kinder registrieren zu lassen, um nach Großbritannien zu gelangen. Die Migranten wurden registriert, bevor sie in Busse stiegen, die sie von Calais zu Aufnahmezentren in ganz Frankreich brachten wurden gesehen, als sie versuchten, in einen in Großbritannien zugelassenen Lastwagen einzusteigen, als dieser an einer Ampel im Stadtzentrum hielt. Christian Salome, Präsident der französischen Wohltätigkeitsorganisation Auberge des Migrants, sagte, er erwarte, dass 2.000 Menschen den Dschungel nicht verlassen würden. Er sagte der französischen Zeitung La Voix du Nord: „Sie wollen immer noch nach England. „Wenn die Evakuierungen am Montag ruhig verlaufen sind, muss man in den kommenden Tagen viel vorsichtiger sein, wenn nur noch diejenigen übrig sind, die nicht gehen wollen und darauf bestehen, dass sie weiterhin versuchen werden, dorthin zu gelangen England.“ Viele Migranten sind immer noch entschlossen, auf dem Haken oder auf Gaunern nach Großbritannien zu gelangen Die französischen Behörden gaben zu, dass diejenigen, die bereit waren, zu gehen, durch einen Mangel an Bussen verzögert wurden, und ein Unterkunftszentrum in Loubeyrat, Zentralfrankreich, wurde nur wenige Stunden zuvor in Brand gesteckt Migranten sollten ankommen. Das Innenministerium teilte mit, es habe auf Ersuchen der Franzosen die Überführung von Flüchtlingskindern aus dem Lager nach Großbritannien vorübergehend ausgesetzt. Die Labour-Abgeordnete Luciana Berger sagte, Sozialarbeiter, die in Großbritannien arbeiten, hätten ein „bürokratisches Durcheinander“ beschrieben, bei dem falsche Namen und Adressen angegeben und die falschen Formulare eingereicht wurden. Der Innenminister teilte den Commons mit, dass 36 britische Beamte daran arbeiten, die jüngsten und am stärksten gefährdeten Kinder zu finden und zu priorisieren, und dass Großbritannien eine „moralische Verantwortung“ habe, zu helfen. Sie sagte, britische Beamte hätten rund 800 Kinder im Dschungel interviewt und fast 200 seien bisher nach Großbritannien gebracht worden, darunter 60 Mädchen, die angeblich einem hohen Risiko sexueller Ausbeutung ausgesetzt seien. Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen schätzen, dass sich noch mehr als 1.000 Kinder im Inneren befinden könnten, darunter 49 unbegleitete Kinder unter 13 Jahren und drei unter 11 Jahren, und warnten, dass sie weiterhin dem Risiko von Menschenhandel und Missbrauch ausgesetzt seien. Der Innenminister sagte, dass in den nächsten Wochen mehrere hundert weitere Kinder in Großbritannien ankommen würden, aber neue Kinder, die nach der Räumung des Dschungels in Calais ankamen, würden in diesem Land nicht aufgenommen. England Teststar der Zukunft? Migranten spielen am Montag kurz vor Einbruch der Dunkelheit im Lager Cricket. Die französische Zeitung Le Figaro sagte, dass rund 500 unbegleitete Kinder in Calais behaupteten, Familien in Großbritannien zu haben, was bedeutet, dass sie berechtigt waren, hierher zu kommen. Miss Rudd sagte, 800 seien befragt worden und 200 seien nach Großbritannien überstellt worden, wobei mehrere hundert weitere in den nächsten Wochen erwartet werden. Sie sagte, dass Kinder, die als unbegleitete Flüchtlinge akzeptiert werden, ihre Eltern nicht „sponsern“ dürften, um nach Großbritannien zu kommen und sich ihnen anzuschließen. Die Konservativen forderten Großbritannien auf, seine Grenzsicherheit zu verstärken, um Migranten daran zu hindern, letzte Versuche zu unternehmen, den Kanal zu überqueren. Charlie Elphicke, Abgeordneter für Dover in Kent, sagte: „Die Menschen werden verzweifelter denn je sein, um zu sehen, ob sie in Großbritannien einbrechen können.“	Großbritannien erhält eine Rechnung in Höhe von 36 Millionen Pfund für die Schließung des „Dschungel“-Camps in Calais	false
856e15b2	Die Zahl der Menschen, die in Polizeigewahrsam sterben, hat den höchsten Stand seit fünf Jahren erreicht, so die neuesten Zahlen, die Stunden veröffentlicht wurden, bevor der Innenminister nach jahrzehntelangem Druck von Familien, die Angehörige verloren haben, eine unabhängige Überprüfung einleitet. Die neuen Statistiken der unabhängigen Polizeibeschwerdekommission IPCC besagen, dass 17 Menschen in oder nach der Inhaftierung durch die Polizei in den Jahren 2014-15 starben – sechs mehr als im Vorjahr. 15 der 17 in Gewahrsam Verstorbenen waren Weiße, 1 Asiate und 1 Schwarze; Zu den Toten gehören 14 Männer und 3 Frauen im Alter von 22 bis 57 Jahren, sagt IPCC – vikram dodd @VikramDodd 23. Juli 2015 Das letzte Mal, dass die Zahl höher war, war 2010-11, als sie bei 21 lag. Das IPCC enthüllte dies auch waren 69 offensichtliche Selbstmorde nach der Haft. Dies ist 50 % mehr als die 46 Personen in den Jahren 2010-11. Am Donnerstagnachmittag wird Theresa May eine unabhängige Überprüfung der Todesfälle in Polizeigewahrsam einleiten und versprechen, die „Ausweichmanöver und Behinderungen“, denen Familien durch die Behörden ausgesetzt sind, auszumerzen. Die Innenministerin will das Vertrauen der Öffentlichkeit in die Polizei umwandeln und erklärt, dass sie „betroffen ist von dem Schmerz und Leid der Familien, die immer noch nach Antworten suchen“. Die Rede, die in Süd-London gehalten werden soll, wird voraussichtlich einige der emotionalsten Themen in der Beziehung der Polizei zu den Gemeinden ansprechen, denen sie dient, und folgt auf fünf Jahre kaum verborgener Kriegsführung zwischen Ministern und der Polizei unter der von den Konservativen geführten Koalition . Die Einladung ausgewählter Gäste zur Teilnahme am Donnerstagnachmittag unterstreicht die Bedeutung von Mays Rede. Darin heißt es: „Der Innenminister wird die Reformen der Regierung darlegen, um die Beziehung zwischen der Öffentlichkeit und der Polizei zu verändern und das historische Prinzip zu bewahren, dass die Öffentlichkeit die Polizei und die Polizei die Öffentlichkeit ist.“ Wir haben die Statistiken für Todesfälle während oder nach Polizeikontakten 2014/15 veröffentlicht http://t.co/CYCLHjmAyU pic.twitter.com/S1JYA2Vc2w — IPCC @IPCCNews 23. Juli 2015 May wird auf ein Thema zurückkommen, auf das sie sich konzentriert hat eine kompromisslose Rede von 2014 vor der Konferenz der Polizeiföderation, die einfache Beamte vertritt. Sie warnte damals, dass Übergriffe durch Beamte das Fundament der britischen Strafverfolgung gefährdet hätten – die Polizeiarbeit mit Zustimmung der Öffentlichkeit. Familien und diejenigen, die ihre Kämpfe für Gerechtigkeit unterstützt haben, sagten, sie wollten alle Einzelheiten der Pläne der Regierung erfahren, bevor sie ihren Segen geben. In Auszügen, die von ihren Beamten im Voraus veröffentlicht wurden, sagt May: „In meiner Zeit als Innenministerin war ich beeindruckt von dem Schmerz und Leiden von Familien, die immer noch nach Antworten suchen, die von den Behörden nicht auf Mitgefühl und Wiedergutmachung gestoßen sind, sondern auf was sie als Ausweichen und Blockieren empfinden. „Ich habe auch aus erster Hand die Frustration von Polizeibeamten und Mitarbeitern gehört, deren Aufgabe es ist, Menschen zu helfen, deren Ausbildung und Verfahren jedoch zu Bürokratie und Verzögerungen führen können. „Niemand – am wenigsten Polizisten – will, dass solche Vorfälle passieren, und ich weiß, dass alle Beteiligten Schritte unternehmen, um sie zu vermeiden. Aber wenn solche Vorfälle passieren, stellt jeder einzelne einen Fehlschlag dar – und hat das Potenzial, die Beziehung zwischen der Öffentlichkeit und der Polizei dramatisch zu untergraben.“ Die Überprüfung der Todesfälle in Gewahrsam wird die von den Beamten angewandten Zwangsmaßnahmen und die Untersuchung von Vorfällen nach anhaltender Kritik von Familien am IPCC untersuchen. Es wird auch untersucht, wie Menschen mit psychischen Gesundheitsproblemen alternative Plätze zur Verfügung gestellt werden können, damit sie nicht in einer Polizeizelle landen, in der Beamte als letztes Mittel fungieren, weil es keine anderen Dienste gibt. Im April enthüllte der Guardian, dass die Innenministerin mehrere Treffen mit den Familien zweier Männer abgehalten hatte, die in Haft starben – Sean Rigg und Olaseni Lewis – und ihnen schrieb, wie bewegt sie von ihrem Leiden war, das dadurch noch schlimmer wurde die Mängel des Strafrechtssystems. Rigg und Lewis starben, nachdem sie 2008 bzw. 2010 von Beamten zurückgehalten worden waren. Ihre Familien müssen trotz jahrelanger rechtlicher Schritte noch vollständige Antworten und die endgültige Lösung erhalten, die sie wollen. Die Innenministerin, Theresa May. Foto: Rex Shutterstock Ajibola Lewis, die Mutter von Olaseni Lewis, sagte, Familien wie ihre hätten vom Innenminister konsultiert werden sollen, was die Überprüfung untersuchen sollte, und es sei zu früh, um zu sagen, ob es sich um eine PR-Maßnahme oder um eine Bedeutung handelte: „ Wir sind überrascht, dass die vorgeschlagene Überprüfung, ihr Zweck und ihr Umfang ohne vorherige Rücksprache mit uns oder anderen Familien in unserer Position bekannt gegeben werden.“ Lewis fügte hinzu: „Wir stellen fest, dass alle staatlichen Stellen, denen wir die Verantwortung übertragen möchten, um solche Todesfälle zu untersuchen und zu verhindern, tiefgreifende und wiederholte Versäumnisse feststellen, einschließlich der Betroffenen in der Geschäftsleitung unseres Polizeidienstes Unabhängige Kommission für Polizeibeschwerden, die Staatsanwaltschaft und die Gerichtsmediziner.“ Marcia Rigg-Samuel sagte über die vorgeschlagene Überprüfung: „Es besteht ein eindeutiger Bedarf für eine radikale Überarbeitung der Funktionsweise des gesamten Systems nach einem Tod in Polizeigewahrsam, und ich hoffe, dass die unabhängige Überprüfung dies sowie die eigentlichen Ursachen angehen wird dieser vermeidbaren Todesfälle und Gewährleistung der Rechenschaftspflicht für diejenigen, die ihren Pflichten gegenüber Mitgliedern der Öffentlichkeit nicht nachkommen.“ Die neuesten offiziellen Statistiken zeigen, dass sich 2013/14 68 Menschen innerhalb von zwei Tagen nach ihrer Festnahme oder Inhaftierung das Leben nahmen, die höchste Zahl seit zehn Jahren. Es gab auch 11 Todesfälle während oder nach dem Polizeigewahrsam. May wird sagen: „Allzu oft werden gefährdete Menschen, oft solche mit psychischen Gesundheitsproblemen, aufgenommen, weil es keinen anderen Ort gibt, an den sie gehen können.“ Es wird auch erwartet, dass May versprechen wird, die Polizei vielfältiger zu machen, da die Polizeibeamten derzeit weißer sind als die Gemeinden, denen sie dienen. Die Rede folgt auf eine Reihe von Ankündigungen zu wichtigen Politikbereichen der neuen konservativen Regierung, die zeigt, dass sie trotz einer nur knappen Mehrheit nicht davor zurückschreckt, ihre Agenda weiterzuverfolgen, die sie als reformistisch und radikal bezeichnet, während Kritiker sie als dogmatisch abtun und spaltend. Jetzt mit parlamentarischer Mehrheit gewählt und mit einem neuen Wahlmandat bewaffnet, scheinen die Konservativen bereit zu sein, den Polizeidienst bis 2020 zu übernehmen. Die Minister werden sagen, dass es notwendige Reformen sind, während einige in der Polizei es als eine Fortsetzung des Bashings sehen werden Der Dienst hat sich in den letzten fünf Jahren, in denen große Budgetkürzungen vorgenommen wurden, bereits verringert und demoralisiert. Der Innenminister droht der Polizei mit Gesetzen über ihre Anwendung von Kontroll- und Durchsuchungsbefugnissen, wenn sie nicht nachweisen, dass sie freiwillig die übermäßige Ausrichtung auf Schwarze und andere Minderheitengruppen ausmerzen. Als Teil der Bestrebungen, die Polizei zu professionalisieren, drängte die Regierung auf die Gründung eines College of Policing, was 2012 der Fall war inhaftierte Personen, die aggressiv und missbräuchlich sein können. Die Polizeiarbeit wird jedoch oft als letzter Ausweg angesehen, und Beamte kommen oft mit Menschen in einem gefährdeten Zustand in Kontakt. „Während wir in den letzten zehn Jahren erhebliche Verbesserungen in diesem Bereich gesehen haben, bleibt noch viel zu tun, um die sektorübergreifende Arbeit zu verbessern. Es ist von entscheidender Bedeutung, dass Gesundheits- und Sozialdienste ihre Rolle anerkennen, um den tragischen Verlust für die betroffenen Familien zu verhindern.“ Deborah Coles von Inquest, die diejenigen unterstützt, die Angehörige während der Haft oder im Kontakt mit staatlichen Stellen verloren haben, sagte: „Es ist noch zu früh zu sagen, ob es sich hier mehr um eine PR-Maßnahme als um einen echten Versuch handelt, einen effektiven Systemwandel herbeizuführen und die notwendige Rechenschaftspflicht von Polizeibeamten.“	Todesfälle in Polizeigewahrsam auf höchstem Niveau seit fünf Jahren	partially false
688adf93	Die Zahl der Briten, die die EU-Staatsbürgerschaft eines anderen Mitgliedsstaates angenommen haben, hat sich im Jahr des Brexit-Referendums mehr als verdoppelt, zeigen offizielle EU-Zahlen. Eurostat, das Statistikamt der EU, zeigt, dass 6.555 britische Staatsangehörige im Jahr 2016 eine solche Staatsbürgerschaft erworben haben, gegenüber 2.478 im Jahr 2015. Deutschland war mit 2.702 das größte Land, in dem Briten die Staatsbürgerschaft annahmen. Frankreich und Belgien folgten mit jeweils 517 bzw. 506 Einwohnern. Andere bedeutende Nutznießer britischer Bürger waren Zypern, Irland und Italien. „Wir sehen einen Brexodus von Menschen, die ihre Pässe aufgeben und sich beeilen, die Staatsbürgerschaft in EU-Ländern anzunehmen, während der Brexit näher rückt“, sagte Paul Butters, ein Sprecher der pro-EU-Kampagne „Best for Britain“. „Die Leute haben das getan, um sich selbst etwas Sicherheit zu geben. Dies sollte David Davis schämen, dass die Menschen das Gefühl haben, keine andere Wahl zu haben, als ihre Staatsbürgerschaft aufzugeben oder einen Antrag auf Doppelstaatsbürgerschaft zu stellen. Diese Menschen geben einen Teil ihrer Identität auf, um zu versuchen, ihre Zukunft zu sichern. „Die Regierung scheint sich nicht darum zu kümmern, und ihr einziges Interesse ist ihr schlecht beratenes Einwanderungsziel von ‚Zehntausenden‘. „Die Regierung hat sich über die Rechte der EU-Bürger hinweggesetzt, und dies ist die reale Manifestation ihrer Taktik. Die Regierung sollte heute unglaublich verlegen sein.“ Inside Politics-Newsletter Die neuesten Nachrichten zu Brexit, Politik und mehr jeden Wochentag direkt in Ihren Posteingang Bitte geben Sie Ihre E-Mail-Adresse ein Bitte geben Sie eine gültige E-Mail-Adresse ein Bitte geben Sie eine gültige E-Mail-Adresse ein REGISTRIEREN Vielen Dank, dass Sie sich für den Inside Politics-Newsletter angemeldet haben {{#verifyErrors }} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} Ich möchte per E-Mail über Angebote, Veranstaltungen und Updates von The Independent informiert werden.

Britische Staatsbürger verlieren nach dem Brexit das automatische Recht, in anderen EU-Ländern zu arbeiten und sich niederzulassen, wodurch die britischen Pässe an Kraft verlieren. Die Regierung hat jedoch gesagt, dass die britischen Pässe in blau geändert werden, was laut Brexiteers nicht der Fall sein könnte, solange das Vereinigte Königreich noch im Block war. Das EU-Referendum fand am 23. Juni 2016 statt, was bedeutet, dass eine Beschleunigung der Anträge auf Staatsbürgerschaft nach dem Referendum nur in der zweiten Jahreshälfte angewendet worden wäre.

Ein mögliches Post-Brexit-Einwanderungsprogramm könnte Schwierigkeiten haben, Arbeitnehmer in weniger attraktive Rollen zu lenken – während ein anderes das Risiko der Ausbeutung der Arbeitskraft erhöhen könnte, warnt ein neuer Bericht. PA Die größten Probleme für das Vereinigte Königreich beim Austritt aus der EU-Zollunion Ein Schlüsselpunkt in den Verhandlungen bleibt der Zugang Großbritanniens zur EU-Zollunion oder der Austritt aus ihr. Seit dem Referendum wird heiß über die Bedeutung des Brexits diskutiert: Würde es einen vollständigen Austritt aus dem bestehenden Abkommen bedeuten, der als harter Brexit bekannt ist, oder die weiche Version, in der wir Teil eines gemeinsamen Zollgebiets für die meisten Waren bleiben würden, wie z Türkei tut? Nr. 10 hat bisher darauf bestanden, dass „Brexit Brexit bedeutet“ und dass Großbritannien die Zollunion verlassen wird, könnte jedoch geneigt sein, seine Position zu ändern, sobald die potenziellen Risiken für die wirtschaftlichen Aussichten des Vereinigten Königreichs klarer werden. Alamy Die größten Probleme für das Vereinigte Königreich beim EU-Austritt Nordirisch-irische Grenze Obwohl im vergangenen Jahr Fortschritte erzielt wurden, gab es immer noch keine solide Einigung darüber, ob es eine harte Grenze zwischen Nordirland und der Republik Irland geben sollte. Um grenzenloses Reisen auf der Insel zu gewährleisten, müssen sich die Länder ordnungsrechtlich angleichen und sich daher an die gleichen Regeln wie die Zollunion halten. Im Dezember lehnte der Koalitionspartner der Konservativen Partei, die DUP, einen Abkommensentwurf ab, der die Grenze zwischen Großbritannien und der EU in die Irische See verlegen würde, da dies die Union untergraben könnte. May hat versprochen, dass dies nicht der Fall sein würde, und hat vorgeschlagen, dass eine „spezifische Lösung“ gefunden werden müsste. Getty Die größten Probleme für das Vereinigte Königreich beim EU-Austritt Übergangsfrist Trotz Protesten einer kleinen Zahl konservativer Abgeordneter sind sich die Regierung und die EU weitgehend einig, dass nach dem Brexit eine Übergangsfrist erforderlich ist. Die Gespräche sind jedoch in eine Sackgasse geraten. Obwohl May zugestimmt hat, dass das Vereinigte Königreich bis 2021 weiterhin zum EU-Haushalt beitragen wird, möchte der Premierminister in der Lage sein, auszuwählen, welche Gesetze, die während dieser Zeit erlassen werden, das Vereinigte Königreich einhalten muss. Chefunterhändler Michel Barnier sagte, das Vereinigte Königreich müsse alle während des Übergangs verabschiedeten Gesetze ohne jeglichen Beitrag britischer Minister oder Abgeordneter übernehmen. EPA Die größten Probleme Großbritanniens beim Austritt aus der EU Rechte von im Vereinigten Königreich lebenden EU-Bürgern Der Premierminister hat EU-Bürgern, die bereits im Vereinigten Königreich leben, das Recht versprochen, nach dem Brexit hier zu leben und zu arbeiten, aber die Rechte derjenigen, die nach dem Brexit-Tag ankommen, bleiben unklar . May besteht darauf, dass diejenigen, die während der Übergangszeit ankommen, nicht bleiben dürfen, während die EU der Ansicht ist, dass die Frist später liegen sollte. Getty Die größten Probleme für das Vereinigte Königreich beim EU-Austritt Zukünftiges Handelsabkommen mit der EU Obwohl dies ein Schlüsselthema in den Verhandlungen ist, muss die Regierung noch genau darlegen, was sie von einem Handelsabkommen mit der EU erwartet. Machtkämpfe innerhalb des Kabinetts haben verhindert, dass eine solide Position erreicht wurde, wobei einige Abgeordnete behaupten, dass kein Deal besser ist als ein schlechter Deal, während andere sich für den Zugang zum Binnenmarkt einsetzen. Die EU hat bereits bestätigt, dass der Zugang zum Binnenmarkt ohne den Verbleib des Vereinigten Königreichs in der Zollunion unmöglich wäre. Getty Die größten Probleme Großbritanniens beim EU-Austritt Zukünftige internationale Handelsabkommen Die Regierung hat bereits damit begonnen, ausländische Staats- und Regierungschefs für potenzielle Handelsabkommen zu gewinnen, mit mehreren hochkarätigen Staatsbesuchen in China, Indien und Kanada im Mai und der inzwischen berüchtigten Einladung in die USA US-Präsident Donald Trump zu Besuch in London. Das Vereinigte Königreich kann jedoch keine Handelsabkommen mit einem anderen Land abschließen, solange es noch Mitglied der EU ist, und der potenzielle Handelsverlust mit den Großmächten der Welt bereitet dem Premierminister Sorgen. Die EU hat erklärt, dass Großbritannien während der Übergangszeit keine Handelsabkommen abschließen kann. EPA Die größten Probleme für das Vereinigte Königreich beim Austritt aus der EU Finanzdienstleistungen Banken im Vereinigten Königreich werden unabhängig vom Ausgang des Brexit hart getroffen. Die EU hat sich geweigert, britischen Banken das Passrecht für den Handel innerhalb der EU zu gewähren, und damit die Hoffnungen auf einen besonderen City-Deal zunichte gemacht. Neuen Berichten zufolge hat Deutschland jedoch vorgeschlagen, den Handel unter der Bedingung zuzulassen, dass das Vereinigte Königreich auch nach der Übergangszeit weiterhin in den EU-Haushalt einzahlt. Das Außenministerium von Getty Ireland sagte Ende 2017, dass mehr als ein Fünftel aller im letzten Jahr ausgestellten irischen Pässe an im Vereinigten Königreich lebende Personen gingen. Das Ministerium in Dublin sagte, dass 2017 mehr als 779.000 Pässe der Republik ausgestellt wurden, eine Rekordzahl, wobei 81.752 irische Staatsbürger in Nordirland zu denen gehörten, die Pässe erhielten. Das Europäische Parlament hat in seinen Entschließungen wiederholt gefordert, einen Mechanismus zu untersuchen, durch den Briten sich für die Beibehaltung ihrer EU-Staatsbürgerschaft entscheiden können, aber bisher wurde in den Gesprächen wenig tatsächliche Bewegung in diese Richtung unternommen – wobei ein solches System zunehmend unwahrscheinlich erscheint.

14010ae5	"Heute hat das Berufungsgericht entschieden, dass die sogenannte „Schlafzimmersteuer“ wegen ihrer Auswirkungen auf schutzbedürftige Personen rechtswidrig ist. Das Berufungsgericht befasste sich mit zwei Berufungen zusammen und entschied in beiden Fällen, dass die Diskriminierung von Opfern häuslicher Gewalt und behinderten Kindern nicht rechtmäßig sei. Ein Einspruch, der von einer nur als „A“ bekannten Frau eingereicht wurde, betraf die Auswirkungen der Richtlinie auf Frauen, die in „Sanctuary Scheme“-Häusern leben – Eigenschaften, die aufgrund von Risiken für das Leben und die körperliche Sicherheit der dort lebenden Frauen und Kinder speziell angepasst sind in ihnen. Der zweite Einspruch, der von Paul und Susan Rutherford und ihrem Enkel Warren eingebracht wurde, betrifft die Auswirkungen der Richtlinie auf schwerbehinderte Kinder, die über Nacht betreut werden müssen. In beiden Rechtsmitteln erkannten die Richter an, dass die Schlafzimmersteuerregelung rechtswidrig diskriminiert – gegen Frauen und Opfer häuslicher Gewalt sowie gegen schwerbehinderte Kinder, die eine Übernachtung benötigen. Berufung von A Diese Berufung wird von einer Frau eingereicht, die nur als „A“ bekannt ist, weil ihre Identität zu ihrer eigenen Sicherheit geschützt werden muss. Sie ist Opfer von Vergewaltigung, Körperverletzung, Belästigung und Stalking durch einen Ex-Partner. Sie stellt die Unterbeschäftigungsregelungen/Größenkriterien, umgangssprachlich als „Schlafzimmersteuer“ bezeichnet, in Frage. Sie behauptet, dass die Wohngeldregelungen, die das System eingeführt haben, diskriminierend sind und verheerende Folgen für sie und ihren 11-jährigen Sohn haben werden. Im Rahmen der „Schlafzimmersteuer“ haben A und ihr Sohn nur Anspruch auf Wohngeld für eine 2-Zimmer-Wohnung. Sie leben jedoch in einem Anwesen mit 3 Schlafzimmern, das von der Polizei im Rahmen eines Zufluchtsprogramms speziell für sie hergerichtet wurde, da ihr Leben und ihre körperliche Unversehrtheit durch ihren Ex-Partner, der eine Vorgeschichte schwerer Gewalt hinter sich hat, in Gefahr sind. Ihr Wohngeld wurde aufgrund der Politik des Außenministers um 14 % gekürzt. Das Sanctuary Scheme zielt darauf ab, gewaltgefährdeten Haushalten zu ermöglichen, sicher in ihrem eigenen Zuhause zu bleiben, indem ein „Sanctuary“ innerhalb des Hauses eingerichtet und der Haushalt unterstützt wird. A hat in ihrem Haus einen „Panikraum“ sowie ein spezielles „Zufluchtssystem“ einrichten lassen. Dazu gehören teure verstärkte Türen, elektrische Alarme, eine Markierung am Haus und Alarme, die mit der Polizeistation verbunden sind. Ihre Rechtsanwältin Rebekah Carrier bei Hopkin Murray Beskine und die Anwälte Karon Monaghan QC, Matrix Chambers, und Caoilfhionn Gallagher und Katie O'Byrne, Doughty Street Chambers, argumentierten, dass der Außenminister die unverhältnismäßigen Auswirkungen des ""Schlafzimmers"" nicht berücksichtigt habe Steuer“ für Opfer häuslicher Gewalt, bei denen es sich überwiegend um Frauen handelt, und insbesondere für diejenigen in Heimen des Sanctuary Scheme. Laut Zahlen, die den Informationsfreiheiten von 79 lokalen Behörden entnommen wurden, war fast 1 von 20 Haushalten, die das Sanctuary Scheme für Personen nutzen, die von schwerer häuslicher Gewalt bedroht sind, von der Unterbelegungsstrafe oder der Schlafzimmersteuer betroffen, insgesamt 281 Haushalte im ganzen Land . Die überwiegende Mehrheit der Menschen im Sanctuary Scheme sind Frauen. Rebekah Carrier, die für A tätige Anwältin, sagte: „Diese Änderungen beim Wohngeld hatten katastrophale Auswirkungen auf schutzbedürftige Menschen im ganzen Land. Das Leben unserer Klientin ist in Gefahr und sie hat große Angst. Die Angst vor der Schlafzimmersteuer und die Ungewissheit in diesem Fall waren groß. Sie lebt in einem Anwesen, das von der Polizei mit großem Aufwand speziell hergerichtet wurde, um sie und ihr Kind zu schützen. Die Aussicht, in eine andere Immobilie umziehen zu müssen, in der sie keinen dieser Schutzmaßnahmen hat, oder einen Untermieter aufzunehmen, hat sich in den drei Jahren, die es gedauert hat, bis dieser Fall vor das Berufungsgericht kam, für sie als groß herausgestellt. Sie ist eine verletzliche alleinerziehende Mutter, die Opfer von Vergewaltigung und Körperverletzung wurde. Sie freut sich, dass das Berufungsgericht die Auswirkungen anerkannt hat, die die Schlafzimmersteuer auf sie und andere ihresgleichen hat. Sie hofft sehr, dass die Außenministerin jetzt Vernunft einsieht und zustimmt, die Regeln zu ändern, um die kleine, aber äußerst gefährdete Klasse von Frauen und Kindern zu schützen, die die Sicherheit eines Zufluchtsorts benötigen, während sie versuchen, ihr Leben nach dem Überleben häuslicher Gewalt wieder aufzubauen . „Es wurde investiert, um diese gefährdeten Frauen zu schützen, und Familien unter diesen Umständen aus ihren Häusern zu verlegen, ist eine falsche Sparsamkeit, da es weiteres Geld kosten wird, die Sicherheit auf dem neuen Grundstück zu gewährleisten, und dies kann zu einem verringerten Sicherheitsniveau führen , sie in Gefahr bringen. Es ist wichtig, sich daran zu erinnern, dass in England und Wales jede Woche durchschnittlich zwei Frauen von einem aktuellen oder ehemaligen Partner getötet werden – der Schutz missbrauchter Frauen und ihrer Kinder ist eine Frage von Leben und Tod, und wir sollten uns immer daran erinnern.“ Die Behauptung von A wird durch Beweise der Wohltätigkeitsorganisation Women’s Aid über die Prävalenz häuslicher Gewalt und über die wichtige Funktion von Sanctuary Schemes bei der Bereitstellung von Schutz und der Verhinderung von Obdachlosigkeit für gefährdete Personen gestützt. Der Rutherford Appeal Paul und Susan Rutherford kümmern sich in einem speziell angepassten Bungalow mit drei Schlafzimmern in Pembrokeshire um ihren schwerbehinderten Enkel Warren. Warren hat eine seltene genetische Störung, das Potokoi-Shaffer-Syndrom, und kann weder gehen noch sprechen oder sich selbst ernähren und benötigt eine 24-Stunden-Betreuung. In seinem heutigen Urteil stellte der Gerichtshof fest, dass die „Schlafzimmersteuer“ behinderte Kinder unter Verstoß gegen das Menschenrechtsgesetz diskriminiert. Sowohl Paul als auch Susan haben selbst Behinderungen und können sich nur mit Hilfe von bezahlten Betreuern, die regelmäßig über Nacht bleiben, um Warren kümmern. Das Paar wurde von der Schlafzimmersteuer für ihr drittes Schlafzimmer getroffen, das sie für die Übernachtung der Betreuer und für die Aufbewahrung von Behindertenausrüstung für Warren benötigen. Die aktuellen Vorschriften sehen ein zusätzliches Schlafzimmer vor, wenn ein behinderter Erwachsener eine Nachtbetreuung benötigt, nicht jedoch für ein behindertes Kind in derselben Situation. Der Gerichtshof stellte fest, dass dies eine rechtswidrige Diskriminierung behinderter Kinder darstellt und nicht gerechtfertigt werden kann. Die Familie hatte eine gerichtliche Überprüfung eingeleitet, um die „Schlafzimmersteuer“ anzufechten, die die Wohngeldzahlungen an Mieter reduziert, die als unterbelegt gelten. Sie haben freiwillige Zahlungen von der lokalen Behörde erhalten, um den Mietausfall zu decken, aber das Gericht befand, dass diese Police nicht angemessen war, da es keine Garantie dafür gibt, dass sie ihnen auch in Zukunft zur Verfügung stehen würde. Lord Thomas CJ stellte fest, dass das Versäumnis des Außenministers, in den Vorschriften für die Betreuung behinderter Kinder über Nacht Vorkehrungen zu treffen, eine rechtswidrige Diskriminierung darstelle, die gegen Artikel 14 der Europäischen Menschenrechtskonvention verstoße. Es sei „sehr schwierig, die Behandlung von Betreuern behinderter Kinder und behinderter Erwachsener im Rahmen derselben Regelung zu rechtfertigen, wo genau das Gegenteil erreicht wird: Versorgung für die Betreuer behinderter Erwachsener, aber nicht für die Betreuer behinderter Kinder.“ Der Außenminister hatte bei der Ausarbeitung der Vorschriften auch das Wohl behinderter Kinder nicht berücksichtigt. Mike Spencer, Anwalt bei der Child Poverty Action Group, der für die Rutherfords handelt, sagte: „Wir freuen uns, dass behinderte Kinder endlich Anspruch auf die gleiche Behandlung wie behinderte Erwachsene haben. Es ist absurd, eine Situation zu haben, in der Kinder wie Warren möglicherweise zu hohen Kosten für den Steuerzahler in ein Heim gehen müssen, weil ihre Familien die benötigte Unterkunft nicht bezahlen können. Anstatt diese Familie der Tortur eines weiteren Berufungsverfahrens auszusetzen, sollte die Regierung jetzt ernsthaft über eine Änderung der Regelungen zum Schutz schwerbehinderter Kinder nachdenken.“ HINWEISE FÜR REDAKTIONEN:"	Berufungsgericht entscheidet, dass „Bedroom Tax“ rechtswidrig ist	false
5d57071e	Der abgebildete Chris Guest More wurde zu einem der meistgesuchten Verbrecher Großbritanniens, nachdem er nach der schockierenden Folter und Ermordung von Brian Waters im Juni 2003 nach Spanien geflohen war. Der offizielle Wachhund sagt, dass viele Fälle ohne ordnungsgemäße Untersuchung zurückgestellt, Notrufe herabgestuft und Opfer in Gefahr gebracht werden. Fast 46.000 Verdächtige befinden sich jetzt in der Fahndungsdatenbank der Polizei, darunter 343 wegen Mordes oder Totschlags und 1.012 wegen Vergewaltigung. Der scharfe Bericht des HM Inspectorate of Constabulary beschuldigte die 43 Streitkräfte von England und Wales, die Öffentlichkeit im Stich gelassen zu haben. Zoe Billingham, die den Wachhund leitet, sagte: „Wir führen in diesem Bericht zu einer sehr ernsten Schlussfolgerung in Bezug auf den potenziell gefährlichen Zustand der britischen Polizeiarbeit. Wir hissen eine rote Fahne: Es ist eine große rote Fahne.“ Ihre Inspektion kam zu folgendem Schluss: Ein Mangel an Detektiven und Ermittlern kam einer „nationalen Krise“ gleich; Polizisten schrieben zu viele Fälle von häuslicher Gewalt ab; 2.700 Sexualstraftäter waren nicht vollständig auf das Risiko hin untersucht worden, das sie für die Öffentlichkeit darstellten; Nur 19 Prozent der Öffentlichkeit hatten im vergangenen Monat einen Beat Bobby gesehen, als der Niedergang der Gemeindepolizei weiterging; Banden gefährlicher Krimineller wurden nicht offiziell klassifiziert und überwacht. Polizeigewerkschaften machten lähmende Haushaltskürzungen als Teil der nationalen Sparmaßnahmen verantwortlich. Seit 2009 – dem Jahr, bevor die Tory-geführte Koalition an die Macht kam – haben die Streitkräfte rund 21.500 Offiziere verloren. Miss Billingham sagte, die Probleme, mit denen die Polizei konfrontiert sei, seien nicht nur auf die von der Regierung verhängten Haushaltskürzungen zurückzuführen. Zwanzig Prozent der 45.960 gesuchten Verdächtigen in der Datenbank wurden wegen Diebstahls und einer von acht wegen Gewalt gesucht. Weitere Hauptkategorien waren Terrorismus und Schusswaffendelikte. HMIC sagte, es habe ernsthafte Bedenken, dass die Streitkräfte „unzureichende Maßnahmen“ ergriffen, um Verdächtige aktiv zu finden. Es fügte hinzu: „Zu oft werden Verdächtige, die im Zusammenhang mit Verbrechen gesucht werden, nicht unerbittlich aufgespürt.“ Unter denen, die vor der Justiz geflohen sind, befindet sich ein Mann, der angeblich einen Teenager und zwölf Monate später eine Mutter von drei Kindern erschossen hat. DIE FLÜCHTLINGE, DIE WEGEN VERGEWALTIGUNG UND MORD GESUCHT WERDEN Chris Guest More MORD Chris Guest More, 39, wurde einer der meistgesuchten Verbrecher Großbritanniens, nachdem er nach der schockierenden Folter und Ermordung von Brian Waters im Juni 2003 nach Spanien geflohen war.

Arif Chowdhury KINDESMISSBRAUCH Arif Chowdhury, 20, der mutmaßliche Rädelsführer einer Bande, die angeblich ein 13-jähriges Mädchen vergewaltigt hatte, floh, nachdem er gegen Kaution freigelassen worden war. Die Polizei glaubt, dass er sich in Bangladesch versteckt hält. Kevin Thomas Parle MORD Kevin Thomas Parle, 36, floh aus Liverpool nach der Erschießung von Liam Kelly, 16, im Jahr 2004. Ein Jahr später wurde er verdächtigt, Mutter Lucy Hargreaves getötet zu haben. Sultan Amari RAPE Der syrische Migrant Sultan Amari, 46, floh letztes Jahr während seines Prozesses in die Türkei, weil er einen Universitätsstudenten in Chester vergewaltigt hatte. Er wurde in Abwesenheit zu 11 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt. Costas Sampson RAPE Costas Sampson, 26, ein griechischer Zypriot, floh an dem Tag, an dem er wegen der Vergewaltigung eines Mädchens, das er 2010 in einem Londoner Nachtclub kennengelernt hatte, vor Gericht stehen sollte, aus dem Land floh letztes Jahr nach der Hälfte seines Prozesses in die Türkei. HMIC stellte fest, dass die Daten von mindestens 67.000 Personen, die der Begehung von Straftaten verdächtigt wurden, nicht in der Datenbank waren – wenn sie in einem anderen Teil des Landes angehalten würden, würde sie nicht anzeigen, dass sie gesucht wurden. Die Inspektoren sagten, die Öffentlichkeit sei einem „inakzeptablen Risiko“ ausgesetzt, weil einige unter Druck stehende Kräfte Notrufe herabstuften. Dies bedeutete, dass die Beamten innerhalb einer Stunde statt der üblichen 15 Minuten auf einen Anruf reagieren durften. Eine andere Taktik bestand darin, keine Beamten zu Fällen von häuslicher Gewalt zu schicken. In dem 128-seitigen Bericht heißt es, dass die „unerwünschten Praktiken“ dazu führten, dass „die Forderung nach sofortigen und wirksamen Maßnahmen der Polizei künstlich unterdrückt wurde“. Der Wachhund sagte, dies sei eine Form der Rationierung von Polizeidiensten. Eine von fünf Ermittlungen wurde nie weitergeführt, weil das Opfer „Polizeimaßnahmen nicht unterstützte“. In Fällen von häuslicher Gewalt stieg diese Zahl auf ein Drittel. Inspektoren sagten, einige Streitkräfte nutzten diese Option, um die Ermittlungen vorzeitig abzuschließen. In dem Bericht heißt es: „Ein übermäßiger Gebrauch dieses Ergebnisses wird wahrscheinlich bedeuten, dass viel zu viele Täter von extrem schädlichen häuslichen Missbrauchsverbrechen nicht vor Gericht gestellt werden und die Opfer von der Polizei im Stich gelassen werden.“ Miss Billingham sagte: „Wir haben gesehen, wie einige Streitkräfte versuchen, den Druck auf ihre Teams zu verringern, indem sie Anrufe auf ihren Dienst künstlich unterdrücken oder herabstufen, wodurch ihre Fähigkeit, die effektivsten und schnellsten Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, verringert wird. Dies ist oft eine unbeabsichtigte Folge der jüngsten Änderungen, die Kräfte vorgenommen haben, häufig als Reaktion auf die Herausforderung der Sparmaßnahmen und während sie sich bemühen, auf die steigende und sich ständig ändernde Nachfrage zu reagieren. „Folglich werden einige grundlegende Dinge nicht getan. Wir haben Beweise dafür gefunden, dass weniger Verhaftungen vorgenommen werden, einige Verbrechen ohne ordnungsgemäße Ermittlungen zurückgestellt werden und Verdächtige nicht immer unerbittlich aufgespürt werden.“ Brian Paddick, Sprecher der Liberaldemokraten für innere Angelegenheiten, ein ehemaliger hochrangiger Polizeibeamter, sagte: „Das ist völlig inakzeptabel Polizisten, die mehr tun, als irgendjemand vernünftigerweise von ihnen erwarten kann, sind gezwungen, „Leben in Gefahr“-Anrufe herabzustufen. „Wie lange dauert es, bis jemand stirbt, weil kein Polizist da ist, um zu reagieren? Die Polizei tut nicht genug, um uns vor einigen der gefährlichsten Kriminellen zu schützen. Hunderte von Mördern und Vergewaltigern werden nicht unter Kontrolle gehalten. Diese Leute sollten nicht auf unseren Straßen sein.“ Lucy Hastings von der Wohltätigkeitsorganisation Victim Support sagte, die Opfer würden im Stich gelassen. Insgesamt wurde eine Kraft als hervorragend, 28 als gut, 13 als verbesserungsbedürftig und eine als unzureichend bewertet. Michael Barton, der Sprecher des Rates der Nationalen Polizeichefs für Kriminaloperationen, sagte, es sei enttäuschend, dass HMIC Bedenken habe, dass einige Kräfte zu kurz kämen. Er machte Budgetkürzungen und den Verlust von Tausenden von Beamten und Mitarbeitern verantwortlich und fügte hinzu: „Es ist eine einfache Realität, dass wir mehr Prioritäten setzen müssen.“ Steve White von der Police Federation, die einfache Beamte vertritt, sagte: „Was Wir sehen, dass es sich um einen Dienst handelt, der nur von Kostenbeschränkungen angetrieben wird, und einige Bereiche der Polizei stehen auf der kritischen Liste und bewegen sich auf die Intensivstation zu.“ Brandon Lewis, der Minister für Polizei und Feuerwehr, sagte: „Das freut mich Zwei Drittel der Streitkräfte werden im heutigen Bericht als gut oder hervorragend bewertet. „Aber einige müssen eindeutig noch mehr tun, um die Dienstleistungen zu erbringen, die die Gemeinschaft erwartet und verdient. Diejenigen, die als unzureichend oder verbesserungsbedürftig identifiziert wurden, müssen dringend Maßnahmen ergreifen. „Ich bin auch besorgt über die Feststellungen von HMIC über gesuchte Verdächtige, die nicht auf dem Nationalen Computer der Polizei aufgezeichnet wurden. Polizeichefs müssen schnell und entschlossen auf die Empfehlung von HMIC reagieren, um sicherzustellen, dass diese inakzeptable Situation behoben wird.“	Polizeikrise: 1.012 Vergewaltiger und 343 Mörder auf der Flucht	partially false
6ffa74c1	"Nur jeder fünfte Asylbewerber in Europa stammt aus Syrien. Die EU verzeichnete im April, Mai und Juni 213.000 Ankünfte, aber nur 44.000 von ihnen flohen vor dem syrischen Bürgerkrieg. Aktivisten und linke Abgeordnete haben angedeutet, dass die überwiegende Mehrheit der Migranten aus dem vom Krieg heimgesuchten Staat stammt, und der Regierung vorgeworfen, zu wenig zu tun, um ihnen zu helfen. „Dies entlarvt die in einigen Kreisen verbreitete Lüge, dass eine große Zahl derer, die Europa erreichen, aus Syrien stammt“, sagte David Davies, Tory-Abgeordneter für Monmouth. „Die meisten Menschen, die vor dem Krieg fliehen, gehen in Lager im Libanon oder in Jordanien. ""Viele von denen, die sich dafür entschieden haben, ihr Leben zu riskieren, um nach Europa zu kommen, haben dies aus wirtschaftlichen Gründen getan."" Ungarn hat Pläne zum Bau eines riesigen Zauns entlang der kroatischen Grenze angekündigt – nur wenige Tage nachdem der Zugang von Serbien mit einer 100-Meilen-Stacheldrahtbarriere abgeriegelt wurde Migranten in der kroatischen Hauptstadt Zagreb Sir Bill Cash, ein Tory-Kollege, sagte: „Diese Zahlen sind äußerst beunruhigend. Es wurde argumentiert, dass es sich bei diesem Zustrom ausschließlich um echte Flüchtlinge aus Syrien handelt, während dies zu den wesentlichen Beweisen beiträgt, dass es eine große Anzahl von Wirtschaftsmigranten gibt, die ein besseres Leben anstreben.' Die Zahlen von Eurostat, dem amtlichen Statistikamt der EU, zeigen, dass die Migration von April bis Juni doppelt so hoch war wie im gleichen Zeitraum 2014. Die Zahl der Asylanträge von Afghanen hat sich von 6.300 auf 27.000 vervierfacht. Weitere 17.700 Anträge wurden von Albanern gestellt, in deren Land Frieden herrscht. Weitere 13.900 Bewerber kamen aus dem Irak, der wie Syrien von der Terrorgruppe Islamischer Staat zerrissen wird. Dies entlarvt die in einigen Kreisen verbreitete Lüge, dass eine große Zahl derjenigen, die Europa erreichen, aus Syrien stammt. David Davies, Tory-Abgeordneter für Monmouth Eine halbe Million Migranten sind in diesem Jahr bisher in Europa angekommen, allein im August kamen 156.000 hinzu. Anstatt im ersten sicheren EU-Land, das sie erreichen, Asyl zu beantragen, ziehen die meisten in die wohlhabenden nördlichen Staaten. Die menschlichen Kosten der Krise wurden von den geschätzten 3.000 Migranten bezahlt, die ertrunken sind, nachdem sie ihr Leben für die gefährliche Überquerung des Mittelmeers in die Hände von Menschenschmugglern gelegt hatten. Die Risiken, die viele Familien eingehen, wurden durch den Tod des dreijährigen Aylan Kurdi und seines fünfjährigen Bruders Galip deutlich, deren Leichen Anfang dieses Monats an den Touristenstrand von Bodrum in der Türkei gespült wurden. Mehr als 250.000 Migranten haben Griechenland und Italien erreicht, wo die Behörden kurz vor der Belastungsgrenze stehen. Kämpfen mit der Bewältigung: Kroatiens Premierminister sagte heute, sein Land werde Migranten nach Ungarn und Slowenien umleiten. Polizisten beobachten, wie Migranten an einem Bahnhof nahe der slowenisch-kroatischen Grenze in Dobova, Brezice, auf den Fenstern eines Zuges sitzen. Flüchtlinge machen zunehmend verzweifelte Versuche, Europa zu durchqueren. Eine Gruppe von Migranten ist abgebildet, die versucht, den Fluss Sutla in der Nähe von Senkovec, Kroatien, auf ihrem Weg nach Slowenien zu überqueren ein syrischer Flüchtling, der vor dem Schrecken des Islamischen Staates oder dem tyrannischen Präsidenten Baschar al-Assad flieht. Aber neue Eurostat-Zahlen zeigen die Wahrheit: 80 Prozent stammen sogar aus Pakistan, Nigeria und Albanien - viele von ihnen sind Wirtschaftsflüchtlinge auf der Suche nach einem besseren Leben. Die Mail unterschätzt nicht die Qual und Verzweiflung echter syrischer Asylsuchender, die natürlich Fürsorge und Mitgefühl verdienen. Aus diesem Grund hat David Cameron zu Recht dafür gesorgt, dass diejenigen, denen in Großbritannien Zuflucht gewährt wurde, aus Lagern an der syrischen Grenze stammen und nicht aus denen, die sich bereits in Europa befinden – die möglicherweise keine Syrer sind. Aber Deutschland – indem es zuerst alle Migranten willkommen hieß und dann seine Grenzen zuschlug, als eine überwältigende Zahl der Einladung folgte – hat Chaos für alle seine Nachbarn geschaffen, wo unzählige Menschen jetzt gestrandet sind. Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel hat durch ihre naive und wirre Politik die Zukunft der EU aufs Spiel gesetzt. Die deutsche Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel hat das Chaos letzten Monat angeheizt, indem sie erklärte, dass jeder Syrer, der das Land erreicht, Asyl beantragen könne. Als die Zahlen unkontrollierbar wurden, schloss Berlin seine Grenzen und stürzte Österreich, Ungarn und andere EU-Länder in Aufruhr. Kroatien hat in den letzten zwei Tagen 14.000 Migranten aufgenommen und einige davon letzte Nacht an die ungarische Grenze gebracht. Ungarn verlegt Stacheldraht an der Grenze, nachdem es dasselbe an der Grenze zu Serbien getan hat. Kroatien hat sieben von acht Straßenübergängen nach Serbien geschlossen und seine Grenzschutzbeamten angewiesen, Migranten nach Ungarn und Slowenien umzuleiten. Die ungarische Regierung bezeichnete dies als „völlig inakzeptabel“. Gestern brach Gewalt zwischen syrischen und afghanischen Migranten aus, die um das Einsteigen in Züge in ganz Kroatien kämpften. Und die slowenische Bereitschaftspolizei stellte sich letzte Nacht 200 Migranten in den Weg, die versuchten, aus Kroatien einzureisen. Slowenische Minister sagen, dass sie Asylbewerber aufnehmen, aber jeden zurückschicken werden, der als illegaler Einwanderer gilt. Großbritannien, das zwischen April und Juni 7.470 Asylanträge erhielt, ist unter Beschuss geraten, weil es einem EU-Programm zur Verteilung von 160.000 Migranten auf die 28 Mitgliedstaaten nicht beigetreten ist. Ein Mann benutzt Krücken, als er sich anderen Migranten anschließt, die die Grenze zwischen Griechenland und Mazedonien in der Nähe der Stadt Gevgelija, Mazedonien, überqueren.

Die japanische Investmentbank Mizuho hat gestern als eine der ersten eine Zahl draufgelegt: Die Aufnahme von jährlich bis zu einer Million Flüchtlingen in den nächsten zwei Jahren könne Berlin 25 Milliarden Euro kosten. Das ergibt sich aus einer Grundkalkulation von 12.500 Euro pro Migrant, so Peter Chatwell, Senior Rates Strategist bei Mizuho. Ein Teil der zusätzlichen Ausgaben muss möglicherweise durch zusätzliche Kreditaufnahme gedeckt werden. Mehr als ein halbes Dutzend Banken, die von Reuters kontaktiert wurden, stimmten den Berechnungen von Mizuho weitgehend zu. Anzeige David Cameron hat angekündigt, dass Großbritannien 20.000 gefährdete Syrer aus Lagern im Libanon und in Jordanien unterbringen wird. Er lehnte jedoch Aufrufe ab, Migranten bereits in Europa aufzunehmen, und sagte, dies würde mehr dazu ermutigen, die gefährliche Reise anzutreten. Yvette Cooper, Vorsitzende der Flüchtlings-Taskforce von Labour, sagte: „Großbritanniens Ansatz, nur Flüchtlinge aus den Lagern in Syrien aufzunehmen, funktioniert nicht. „Es ignoriert die Krise, die auch in Europa selbst stattfindet, und bedeutet, dass Großbritannien keinen Einfluss darauf hat, andere Länder dazu zu bringen, sich zur Hilfe zu verpflichten.“ Aber ein Sprecher des Innenministeriums sagte: „Die Beantragung von Asyl darf nicht als einfacher Weg zur Ansiedlung von denen angesehen werden, die eigentlich keine Flüchtlinge sind. „Wir brauchen Systeme, die unbegründete Anträge fernhalten, damit wir alle schneller und effektiver auf diejenigen reagieren können, die wirklich Zuflucht benötigen."

Der minderjährige Royal wird am selben Ort wie Harry und Meghan heiraten. Chris Williamson von Labour sagte: „Es ist wirklich eine Empörung.“ Die Sicherheitsausgaben für die Hochzeit von Prinzessin Eugenie haben sich angesichts zunehmender Terrorängste mehr als verdoppelt, seit sie im Januar ihre Verlobung bekannt gab, sagen Quellen. Möglicherweise müssen zusätzliche Waffenoffiziere eingezogen werden, wenn der neunte in der Thronfolge am 12. Oktober den Tequila-Markenbotschafter Jack Brooksbank heiratet. Eugenie, 28, die keine königlichen Pflichten ausübt, hat sich dennoch entschieden, in der St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle zu heiraten wo Prinz Harry Meghan im Mai heiratete. Bild: Getty Bild: Splash News Vater Prinz Andrew soll ein ähnlich glanzvolles Event für seine jüngere Tochter mit Sarah Ferguson gefordert haben. Eine königliche Quelle sagte: „Der Herzog von York hat darauf bestanden, dass die Hochzeit seiner Tochter ein großer Anlass sein muss, an den man sich erinnert, und möchte, dass alle an Bord kommen, um das glückliche Paar zu feiern.“ Trotz Warnungen vor den zusätzlichen Sicherheitsproblemen, die dies verursachen würde, sind Eugenie und Jack entschlossen, den ganzen Pomp einer Prozession mit offener Kutsche auf der Windsor High Street zu genießen. Bild: Splash News Es bedeutet, dass Dutzende von Beamten eingesetzt werden müssen, um die Route im Voraus zu durchsuchen. Auch Drohnen dürfen das ganze Wochenende über nicht über die Burg fliegen. Die gleiche Taktik wurde für die Hochzeit des Herzogs und der Herzogin von Sussex angewendet, aber Eugenies Hochzeit sollte ursprünglich rund 750.000 Pfund kosten. Die erhöhten Ausgaben sind auf Überstunden der Beamten, Urlaubsausfälle und die Notwendigkeit zusätzlicher Streifen zurückzuführen.

Sie sagte: „In diesen Zeiten erhöhter Sicherheitsrisiken ist es unverantwortlich, dass ein minderjähriges Mitglied der königlichen Familie eine hochkarätige, sehr öffentliche Hochzeit hat. „Dies könnte die Zeit sein, die Rolle und die Kosten kleinerer Royals zu überprüfen.“ Eugenie und Schwester Beatrice, 30, sagten diesen Monat, dass sie nur als „echt“ gesehen werden wollen. Bild: Internet Unknown Bild: Splash News Aber Chris Williamson, Labour-Abgeordneter für Derby North, sagte heute Abend: „Es ist wirklich eine Empörung, wenn Menschen schlecht schlafen und von Armut erfasst werden, dass sich die Menschen diesem auffälligen Konsum hingeben. „Sie sind so weit wie möglich davon entfernt, echte normale Menschen zu sein.

Die riesige Sicherheitsoperation wird von der Met, Thames Valley und British Transport Police geleitet. Aber angesichts der erhöhten Terrorängste in London nach dem Westminster-Angriff in dieser Woche sollen andere Kräfte gebeten worden sein, möglicherweise zu helfen, da andere Teams in der Hauptstadt benötigt werden. Bild: Splash News Bild: Reuters Eugenie und Jack, 32, der britische Vertreter von George Clooneys Tequila-Marke Casamigos, werden 300 Gäste empfangen, darunter Dutzende von Prominenten wie Clooney und seine Anwältin Amal, die auch bei Harrys Hochzeit waren. Model Cara Delevingne, Schauspielerin Suki Waterhouse und Supermodels Kate Moss und Cindy Crawford konnten ebenfalls anwesend sein, neben den Sängern James Blunt und Ellie Goulding sowie Popstar Robbie Williams und Ehefrau Ayda Field, deren Tochter Theodora Rose ein Blumenmädchen sein wird. Beatrice wird Trauzeugin und die Kinder von Prinz William, George, fünf, und Charlotte, drei, werden voraussichtlich ein Pagenjunge und ein Blumenmädchen sein. Bild: Getty Einladungen wurden auch auf 1.200 Mitglieder der Öffentlichkeit ausgedehnt, die die Veranstaltung über einen Live-Feed im Freien verfolgen werden. Eugenies Cousine Zara, ebenfalls eine Enkelin der Queen, heiratete 2011 den ehemaligen englischen Rugby-Kapitän Mike Tindall in einer kleinen Zeremonie in Edinburgh. Die Eltern von Jack und Eugenie werden für die Hochzeit und den Empfang aufkommen. Ein königlicher Sprecher sagte: „Die Kosten für die Sicherheit werden von den einzelnen Polizeikräften und dem Gemeinderat geteilt, aber alle anderen Kosten für die Hochzeit werden privat getragen.“ Hochzeitsliste Prinzessin Eugenie Victoria Helena von York ist ihr voller Titel. Sie ist das sechste Enkelkind der Queen und derzeit das neunte in der Thronfolge. Eugenie und Jack Brooksbank sind seit 7 Jahren zusammen. Das Paar ist blutsverwandt. Die Herzogin von York ist die Ururenkelin von Lady Julia Coke, die die Tochter von Jacks Ururgroßvater Thomas Coke ist. Es werden 350 Gäste in der St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle erwartet, darunter hochrangige Mitglieder der königlichen Familie, darunter die Queen, und die Supermodels Cara Delevingne und Cindy Crawford. Eugenie könnte sich für ihr Hochzeitskleid für den britischen Designer Erdem oder Vivienne Westwood entscheiden. Denn: Es ist richtig für sie, im Schloss zu heiraten. Ingrid Seward Majesty Magazine Chefredakteurin Da ich Prinzessin Eugenie und ihre Schwester Beatrice seit vielen Jahren kenne, kann ich ehrlich sagen, dass Sie nie zwei hübschere, höflichere und bodenständigere Frauen treffen könnten. Sie sind eine Ehre für Familie und Freunde. Sie machen sich mit erfolgreichen Jobs auf den Weg in die Welt und führen das Geschäft einer sehr bekannten Familie. Bild: PA Eugenie ist die Enkelin der Queen und es spricht nichts dagegen, dass sie auf Schloss Windsor heiratet. Es wird erwartet, dass die Königin mit fast allen anderen hochrangigen Mitgliedern der königlichen Familie – und Hunderten oder Tausenden von Gratulanten – anwesend ist, sodass es naheliegend ist, dass für angemessene Sicherheit gesorgt wird. Contra: Warum all dieser Ärger für einen kleinen König? Dai Davies Ex-Chef von Royal Protection Die Tatsache, dass die Königin und hochrangige Royals anwesend sein werden, ist der Grund dafür, dass nichts der Chance überlassen wird, sowie der Schutz der Menge. Ich denke, die Frage sollte gestellt werden, warum diese Kosten und Mühen einem so kleinen König wie Prinzessin Eugenie auferlegt werden. Bild: PA Die Kinder von Prinzessin Anne haben es alle hervorragend geschafft, ohne jegliches Tamtam, und ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, dass viele Menschen dies unterstützen werden. Die Kutschenfahrt durch die Straßen ist ein potentielles Problem. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, wer gedacht hätte, dass dies eine gute Idee wäre, sicherlich hätte keiner von denen, die die Operation planten, sie gefördert.

e3cbd113	Die Regierung hat eine Analyse der Optionen des Vereinigten Königreichs veröffentlicht, wenn es die EU verlässt – was darauf hindeutet, dass sie alle schlechter für die Wirtschaft wären, als in der EU zu bleiben ein Post-EU-Großbritannien. Dem Dokument zufolge würde Großbritannien an Einfluss verlieren und Exporteure könnten mit schädlichen Zöllen belastet werden. Aber Leave-Aktivisten sagten, das zwielichtige Dossier sei irreführend. Verfolgen Sie das jüngste EU-Referendum und die Aktualisierungen der Fragen des Premierministers Die EU-Abstimmung Großbritanniens: Alles, was Sie wissen müssen Iain Duncan Smith – einer von fünf Kabinettsministern, die sich für eine Abstimmung zum Austritt aus der EU einsetzen – sagte, er habe den Austrittsfall falsch dargestellt, indem er vorschlug, Großbritannien könne dies tun Folgen Sie dem Beispiel anderer Nicht-EU-Länder wie Norwegen oder der Schweiz. Er sagte: Die Wahrheit ist, dass wir den Deal eines anderen Landes nicht kopieren werden. Wir werden eine Einigung zu unseren eigenen Bedingungen haben – und eine, die die Kontrolle über unsere Grenzen und Geld an Großbritannien zurückgibt. Das ist die sicherere Wahl. Er sagte, die Regierung leugne das Risiko, Mitglied der EU zu bleiben. Dieses zweifelhafte Dossier werde niemanden täuschen, sagte er und fügte hinzu, dass die wirkliche Ungewissheit die Zukunft des EU-Projekts sei. Kabinettsminister dürfen auf beiden Seiten der Debatte frei Wahlkampf betreiben, aber die offizielle Position der Regierung spricht sich dafür aus, beim Referendum am 23. Juni in einer reformierten EU zu bleiben. Linie Vier Post-Exit-Optionen UK- und EU-FlaggenBildrechteReuters Norwegisches Modell: Mitglied des Europäischen Wirtschaftsraums, uneingeschränkter Zugang zum Binnenmarkt, verpflichtet, einen finanziellen Beitrag zu leisten und die Mehrheit der EU-Gesetze zu akzeptieren, Freizügigkeit gilt wie im EU-Schweizer Modell: Mitglied der Europäischen Freihandelsassoziation, aber nicht des Europäischen Wirtschaftsraums, Zugang zum EU-Markt durch eine Reihe bilateraler Abkommen geregelt, deckt einige, aber nicht alle Handelsbereiche ab, leistet auch einen finanziellen Beitrag, aber geringer als der von Norwegen, hat keinen General Pflicht zur Anwendung von EU-Gesetzen, muss aber einige EU-Vorschriften umsetzen, um Handel zu ermöglichen, Freizügigkeit gilt Freihandelsabkommen: Deal würde ausgehandelt, nachdem das Vereinigte Königreich für den Austritt gestimmt hat, bedeutet im Allgemeinen niedrige Zölle auf Waren, aber der Handel mit Dienstleistungen ist normalerweise begrenzter, genauer Verpflichtungen würden von der Tiefe der Vereinbarung abhängen: Je umfassender, desto mehr Zusammenarbeit gäbe es bei Standards, Vorschriften usw., keine Freizügigkeit oder Finanzen ial Contribution, es sei denn, sie wären Teil des spezifischen Abkommens Regeln der Welthandelsorganisation: WTO legt Regeln für den internationalen Handel fest, die für alle Mitglieder gelten, keine Freizügigkeit oder finanziellen Beitrag, keine Verpflichtung zur Anwendung von EU-Recht, obwohl gehandelte Waren weiterhin EU-Standards erfüllen müssten , einige Zölle würden auf den Handel mit der EU erhoben, der Handel mit Dienstleistungen wäre eingeschränkt. Das Dokument besagt, dass die Handelsvereinbarungen Norwegens und der Schweiz außerhalb der EU von ihnen verlangen, finanzielle Beiträge zu leisten, den EU-Grundsatz der Freizügigkeit von Personen zu akzeptieren und sich zu unterwerfen zu anderen EU-Gesetzen. Unterdessen bieten die Vereinbarungen der Schweiz und Kanadas nur begrenzten Zugang zum Binnenmarkt, fügt sie hinzu. In einer Rede in London sagte Herr Hammond, Großbritannien werde nach einem Austritt zwei Jahre lang in Gespräche mit der EU verwickelt sein, während unsere Konkurrenten, einschließlich unserer EU-Konkurrenten, voranschreiten. Er sagte, es gebe keine Garantie, dass Großbritannien innerhalb der Zweijahresfrist eine Einigung erzielen könne, und die Gespräche könnten sich über viele Jahre hinziehen, da es keinen guten Willen der Mitgliedstaaten gebe, Großbritannien zu einer Einigung zu verhelfen. Er behauptete, die Leave-Aktivisten hätten es bewusst vermieden, zu skizzieren, wie ein Post-Exit-Handelsabkommen aussehen würde, weil es keine glaubwürdigen Optionen gab, die dem Abkommen nahe kamen, das wir bereits auf dem Tisch haben und das von David Cameron ausgehandelt worden war. MedienunterschriftKönnte Norwegen als Model für Großbritannien arbeiten? Herr Hammond sagte, die Leave-Aktivisten sollten ehrlich zu den Wählern sein und sagen, dass sie bereit sind, Arbeitsplätze und Wachstum zu opfern, um die Migration einzudämmen, um die Zahlung in die EU einzustellen. Er sagte, er hoffe, dass das Dossier die Leave-Aktivisten dazu zwingen würde, ihrer Vision eines Großbritanniens nach der EU etwas Fleisch auf die Knochen zu geben. Die offizielle Regierungsanalyse der EU-Mitgliedschaft des Vereinigten Königreichs ist gesetzlich gemäß dem EU-Referendumsgesetz vorgeschrieben, das den Weg für das In-Out-Referendum über die EU-Mitgliedschaft ebnete. „Analyse fehlerhaft“ Wenn Großbritannien für den Austritt aus der EU stimmt, muss es eine neue Handelsbeziehung mit einer dann 27-köpfigen Organisation aushandeln, damit britische Firmen Waren und Dienstleistungen in EU-Länder verkaufen können, ohne von Strafen oder Funkenschlag betroffen zu sein ein Handelskrieg. Das Regierungspapier führt Beispiele anderer Länder wie Norwegen, der Schweiz und Kanada an, die Handelsabkommen mit der EU haben, ohne Mitglied zu sein – sowie die Möglichkeit, sich insgesamt von der EU zu lösen und Abkommen mit einzelnen Ländern auf der ganzen Welt abzuschließen Handelsorganisation. Diese Szenarien wurden in der Vergangenheit von Anti-EU-Aktivisten erwähnt. Im Gespräch mit der BBC sagte die norwegische Ministerpräsidentin Erna Solberg, sie würde ihr Land gerne in die EU aufnehmen, weil es keinen Einfluss auf wichtige Entscheidungen habe und im Grunde... einen Teil unserer Demokratie Europa überlassen habe. Auf die Frage, ob sie denke, dass Großbritannien den Zugang zum Binnenmarkt behalten könne, ohne der Freizügigkeit von Personen zu unterliegen, sagte sie: Zu glauben, dass man alles bekommt, was man will, ohne etwas zurückzugeben, kommt in keinem politischen Gremium vor. Vote Leave AktivistenBild CopyrightGetty Images BildunterschriftFünf Kabinettsminister, darunter Herr Duncan Smith, führen eine Kampagne gegen die Regierung für einen EU-Austritt Das Regierungspapier sagt, dass sie alle ernsthafte Risiken für das Geschäft bergen – aber Leave-Aktivisten sagen, dass die Analyse fehlerhaft ist, weil sie es nicht ist erwägen Sie die Möglichkeit eines maßgeschneiderten Handelsabkommens zwischen dem Vereinigten Königreich und der EU ohne Zölle oder Handelshemmnisse. Gerard Lyons von den Investmentmanagern Black Rock und leitender Wirtschaftsberater des Londoner Bürgermeisters und Leave-Aktivisten Boris Johnson sagte, es wäre ein Schock für beide Seiten, wenn Großbritannien austreten würde, aber es wäre im Interesse der EU, ein Handelsabkommen mit Großbritannien zu erzielen es war einer der größten Exportmärkte der EU. Unterdessen ist Lord Lamont der jüngste Grande der Konservativen, der seine Farben auf die eine oder andere Seite der EU-Debatte nagelt. Lord Lamont, der Anfang der 1990er Jahre Kanzler war, als Großbritannien aus dem Europäischen Wechselkursmechanismus ausstieg, fordert den Austritt Großbritanniens und argumentiert im Daily Telegraph, dass das Land wirtschaftlich erfolgreich sein und die Kontrolle über die Einwanderung zurückerlangen würde.

1aff43d1	"The Mail startet heute eine Kampagne zur Rettung der Hauptstraßen Großbritanniens – nachdem in der ersten Hälfte dieses Jahres unglaubliche 50.000 Arbeitsplätze im Einzelhandel gestrichen wurden. Die Zahlen enthüllen das Blutbad im ganzen Land, als Hunderte von Geschäften – von großen Ketten bis hin zu kleinen Läden – ihre Türen schlossen. Unternehmenslenker, Ladenbesitzer und Abgeordnete machen Strafzinsen dafür verantwortlich, die Hauptstraßen lahmlegen und Internetgiganten einen enormen Vorteil verschaffen. Heute fordern die Geschäftsführer einiger der größten Ketten des Landes zusammen mit Politikern aller Parteien Reformen, da sie davor warnen, dass himmelhohe Zinsen Investitionen ersticken und alteingesessene Unternehmen an die Wand treiben. The Mail startet eine Kampagne zur Rettung der britischen High Street, nachdem 50.000 Arbeitsplätze im Einzelhandel gestrichen wurden. Letztes Jahr schlossen Geschäfte mit einer Rate von 16 pro Tag. Von der Press Association zusammengestellte Zahlen zeigen, dass zwischen Januar und Juni dieses Jahres 50.000 Arbeitsplätze entweder verloren gingen oder voraussichtlich wegfallen werden. In den letzten Monaten hat die Spur der Zerstörung bekannte Namen getroffen, darunter House of Fraser – das 6.000 Arbeitsplätze in Gefahr gebracht hat – und Poundworld, das in die Verwaltung gestürzt ist und weitere 5.100 gefährdet hat. Toys R Us und Maplin brachen zusammen, während Ketten wie Prezzo, Byron und Jamie's Italian Restaurants schlossen und Hunderte von Arbeitsplätzen strichen. Unterdessen kassiert der Finanzbeamte immer mehr von den Geschäftssteuern – mit einer für dieses Jahr prognostizierten Gesamtsumme von 30,8 Mrd. £ gegenüber 29,6 Mrd. £ im letzten Jahr. Die überwiegende Mehrheit stammt von großen Einzelhändlern im Herzen von Städten, während Online-Shops und Einkaufszentren außerhalb der Stadt sowohl bei den Sätzen als auch bei der Körperschaftssteuer viel weniger zahlen. Kritiker sagen, dass hohe Unternehmenszinsen, die Unternehmen in die Pleite zwingen, selbstzerstörerisch sind, da sie die Steuereinnahmen verringern. Marks & Spencer, das in den nächsten vier Jahren mehr als 100 Geschäfte schließen wird, wobei Hunderte von Arbeitsplätzen gefährdet sind, sagte der Mail, dass steigende Zinsen teilweise für seine drastischen Pläne verantwortlich seien. Chief Executive Steve Rowe sagte: „Geschäftszinsen sind eine unfaire Steuerlast, die direkt zu den Herausforderungen beiträgt, mit denen die High Street konfrontiert ist. Die langfristigen Auswirkungen dieser Gebühren sind jetzt Realität. „Unser Geschäft in Covent Garden war im Jahr vor seiner Schließung mit einer Ratenerhöhung von fast einer halben Million Pfund konfrontiert, eine unhaltbare Situation für jeden Einzelhändler. Heute fordern die Vorstandsvorsitzenden einiger der größten Ketten des Landes zusammen mit Politikern aller Parteien Reformen, da sie davor warnen, dass himmelhohe Zinsen Investitionen ersticken und alteingesessene Unternehmen an die Wand treiben. „Diese Herausforderungen werden andauern, bis das System reformiert ist um gleiche Wettbewerbsbedingungen zwischen Einzelhandelsgeschäften und Online-Händlern zu schaffen.' Der Vorstandsvorsitzende von Tesco, Dave Lewis, sagte: „Der britische Einzelhandel ist der beschäftigungsstärkste Sektor der Wirtschaft, daher wird es wirtschaftliche Auswirkungen haben, wenn wir ständig Unternehmen so verlieren, wie wir es sind. ""Wenn sie also nicht aufpassen, riskiert die Regierung, zu viel von den Geschäftszinsen abzuziehen und dann mittelfristig zu verlieren."" Der Labour-Abgeordnete Frank Field, Vorsitzender des Arbeits- und Rentenausschusses der Commons, sagte: „Die Besteuerung von Online-Händlern und -Unternehmen, die ihre Gewinne ins Ausland leiten, sollte jetzt geändert werden. „Eine spezielle Umsatzsteuer sollte auf die Firmen erhoben werden, die mit der Hauptstraße konkurrieren und kaum einen Cent an die Regierung zahlen. Eine Reform ist längst überfällig.“ Der leitende Tory-Hinterbänkler Jacob Rees-Mogg sagte: „Die Geschäftsraten haben mit dem wirtschaftlichen Wandel nicht Schritt gehalten. High-Street-Shops werden bestraft, während Online-Verkäufer mit niedrigeren Gebühren rechnen müssen, was ihnen einen weiteren Wettbewerbsvorteil verschafft.' Der Vorsitzende der Lib Dem, Sir Vince Cable, sagte: „Dies ist eine sehr wichtige und willkommene Kampagne. Letztes Jahr schlossen Geschäfte mit einer Rate von 16 pro Tag. Zahlen, die von der Press Association zusammengestellt wurden, zeigen, dass zwischen Januar und Juni dieses Jahres 50.000 Arbeitsplätze entweder verloren gegangen sind oder voraussichtlich verschwinden werden. Die Geschäftstarife basieren auf dem geschätzten Mietwert einer Immobilie. Das bedeutet, dass traditionelle Einzelhändler wie Kaufhäuser mit großen Flächen in Innenstädten besonders hart getroffen werden, während neuere Internetkonkurrenten wie Amazon deutlich weniger zahlen. Mike Cherry, Vorsitzender der Federation of Small Businesses, sagte, eines von fünf Mitgliedern seiner Organisation habe aufgrund des Drucks durch die Geschäftsraten darüber nachgedacht, zu schließen oder zu verkaufen. Er sagte: „Neben steigenden Mieten, steigenden Arbeitskosten und schwächelnder Verbrauchernachfrage bedrohen steigende Geschäftszinsrechnungen die Hauptstraßen im ganzen Land. ""Geschäftssteuern sind eine unfaire und regressive Steuer, die Unternehmen trifft, bevor sie ihren ersten Cent Umsatz gemacht haben, geschweige denn Gewinn."" Suren Thiru, Leiter der Wirtschaftsabteilung der britischen Handelskammer, fügte hinzu: „Das kaputte Steuersystem für Unternehmen übt Druck auf Unternehmen aller Formen und Größen aus, ohne Rücksicht auf die wirtschaftlichen Umstände oder die Geschäftsleistung. ""In diesem Klima des schleppenden Wachstums und schwacher Investitionen ist ein System, das Mittel aufzehrt und das Investitionspotenzial der Firmen untergräbt, besonders erschütternd."" Auch das Institute of Directors und die Confederation of British Industry unterstützten Reformaufrufe. Wirtschaftsführer, Ladenbesitzer und Abgeordnete machen Strafzinsen dafür verantwortlich, die Hauptstraßen lahmlegen und Internetgiganten einen enormen Vorteil verschaffen. Unterdessen sagen Kneipen- und Restaurantchefs, dass die Zinsen es schwer gemacht haben, in einer Branche zu überleben, in der die Gewinne schon immer knapp waren und die steigende Inflation dazu geführt hat sie unter noch mehr Druck. Experten sagen, dass 2018 als „Jahr der freiwilligen betrieblichen Regelung“ in die Geschichte eingehen wird – ein Insolvenzverfahren, mit dem in diesem Jahr mehrere Ladenschließungsprogramme durchgesetzt wurden. Robert Hayton, Head of UK Business Rates bei der Altus Group, sagte: „Geschäftszinsen sind selten der einzige Grund für Insolvenzen, aber sicherlich ein beitragender Faktor, da die Rechnungen in den sieben Jahren vor der Neubewertung im letzten Jahr durch Inflation um mehr als ein Fünftel gestiegen sind. ""Fügen Sie das zu dem tödlichen Cocktail aus anderen erhöhten Betriebskosten für den nationalen Lebensunterhalt und die Ausbildungsabgabe hinzu und es entsteht der perfekte Sturm."" Die Denkfabrik des Institute for Fiscal Studies sagt, dass die Unternehmenssteuersätze abgebaut und durch ein neues System ersetzt werden sollten, bei dem der Wert des Grundstücks selbst besteuert wird und nicht die Gebäude darauf. Der unabhängige Einzelhandelsanalyst Nick Bubb sagte: „Die Minister der Regierung werden Krokodilstränen über die Situation weinen, aber die Regierungspolitik ist teilweise schuld, angesichts des beklagenswerten Versäumnisses der Regierung, die unfaire Belastung der Geschäftszinsen von dem hart gedrückten Hoch abzulenken Straßenhändler und einen Weg finden, Online-Händler effektiver zu besteuern.“"	Daily Mail-Kampagne zur Rettung der Hauptstraßen Großbritanniens nach dem Abbau von 50.000 Arbeitsplätzen im Einzelhandel	partially false
a8ecc454	Die Zahl der Kinder, die Pflegeeltern benötigen, ist während der Coronavirus-Pandemie um 44 % gestiegen, während die Zahl der Personen, die Pflegeeltern werden möchten, im Vergleich zum Vorjahreszeitraum um fast die Hälfte zurückgegangen ist, so die führende britische Kinderhilfsorganisation. Vom 1. März bis 23. April 2020 gab es 2.349 Empfehlungen an Barnardos Pflegedienste in England, Wales und Nordirland, eine Zahl, die von 1.629 im gleichen Zeitraum im Jahr 2019 in die Höhe geschossen ist. Inzwischen ist die Zahl der Anfragen von Menschen, die Pflegeeltern werden möchten, gestiegen für die Wohltätigkeitsorganisation fiel von 302 auf 161 – ein dramatischer Rückgang um 47 %. Barnardo’s sagt, dies habe einen „Ausnahmezustand“ geschaffen, da Kinder, die möglicherweise Missbrauch und Vernachlässigung erlebt haben, auf Orte mit liebevollen Pflegefamilien warten. Ohne dass sich weitere potenzielle Pflegeeltern melden, werden Hunderte von Kindern, die an Barnardo’s überwiesen werden, nicht bei einer Familie untergebracht. Die führende britische Kinderhilfsorganisation ist der Ansicht, dass die Coronavirus-Pandemie und der Lockdown den Druck auf gefährdete Familien erhöht haben, wobei Arbeitsplatzverluste, zunehmende Armut und eine Verschlechterung der psychischen Gesundheit zum Zusammenbruch der Familie geführt haben. Kinder wurden auch in Häusern eingesperrt, in denen häusliche Gewalt und sexueller Missbrauch stattfinden. Dieser Druck wird wahrscheinlich mehr Familien betreffen, wenn die Krise anhält. Gleichzeitig ist Barnardo’s der Ansicht, dass die Veränderung der Umstände, die viele aufgrund von COVID-19 und die Ungewissheit über die Zukunft erlebt haben, dazu geführt hat, dass weniger Anfragen von Menschen, die eine Förderung suchen, an die Wohltätigkeitsorganisation gestellt werden. Barnardo’s ruft Menschen über 21, die ein freies Zimmer und die Zeit und das Engagement haben, ein Kind zu unterstützen, dazu auf, Kontakt aufzunehmen und die Aufnahme eines Pflegekindes in Erwägung zu ziehen. Barnardo’s heißt Pflegeeltern aus allen Gesellschaftsschichten willkommen, darunter Alleinstehende, Personen aus der LGBTQ+-Community sowie Menschen mit schwarzem, asiatischem und ethnischem Hintergrund. Die Wohltätigkeitsorganisation möchte auch klarstellen, dass Pflegeeltern von Barnardo’s bei jedem Schritt unterstützt werden und auch Anspruch auf finanzielle Unterstützung einschließlich Pflegegeld haben. Um mehr über Pflege bei Barnardo's zu erfahren, besuchen Sie https://www.barnardos.org.uk/foster oder rufen Sie 07712402312 oder 0800 0277 280 an. Javed Khan, Chief Executive von Barnardo, sagte: „Die Coronavirus-Pandemie hat gefährdete Familien am härtesten getroffen, wobei viele den Krisenpunkt erreichen. Dies hat zu einem Ausnahmezustand geführt, da mehr Kinder denn je eine sichere und liebevolle Pflegefamilie brauchen, während sich weniger Erwachsene als potenzielle Pflegeeltern melden. „Barnardo’s hat über 100 Jahre Erfahrung darin, gefährdete Kinder mit liebevollen Pflegefamilien zusammenzubringen, die Kindern die lebenswichtige Liebe und Unterstützung bieten, die sie brauchen, um zu gedeihen. Wenn Sie Pflegeeltern bei Barnardo’s werden, unterstützen wir Sie bei jedem Schritt mit Schulungen und einem engagierten Sozialarbeiter. Sie erhalten auch finanzielle Unterstützung, einschließlich eines Pflegegeldes. „Heute gibt es Hunderte von Kindern, die an Barnardo’s verwiesen wurden und darauf warten, bei einer Pflegefamilie untergebracht zu werden. Wenn Sie über 21 Jahre alt sind, ein freies Zimmer und die Zeit und das Engagement haben, ein Kind in Not zu unterstützen, sollten Sie sich noch heute mit uns in Verbindung setzen.“ ENDE Fallstudie Nichol Garcia ist 50 Jahre alt und seit neun Jahren Vollzeitpfleger. Sie lebt mit ihrem Sohn im Teenageralter und drei Pflegekindern in Nottingham. Nichol sagt: „Ich hatte das Gefühl, in meinem Herzen und Leben Platz für mehr Kinder zu haben, und nachdem ich mit meiner Familie und vor allem mit meinem Sohn gesprochen hatte, nahm ich Kontakt mit Barnardo’s auf und habe es seitdem nicht bereut. Ich habe so viele verschiedene Dinge in meinem Leben gemacht, aber Pflegefamilien sind bei weitem das Beste, was ich je gemacht habe.“ In den letzten neun Jahren haben Nichol und ihr Sohn 11 junge Menschen, hauptsächlich Teenager, aber auch jüngere Kinder, gefördert, von denen die meisten lange Zeit bei ihnen geblieben sind. „Ich war besorgt, dass ich mich aufregen würde, wenn die Kinder gehen, da ich so viel in jedes Kind investiere, aber wir bleiben mit allen in Kontakt, da sie jetzt ein Teil unserer Familie sind, und wir treffen uns auch manchmal. Ich bin ein Teil ihrer Geschichte und sie sind ein Teil meiner.“ Nichol räumt ein, dass die Förderung auch einige Herausforderungen mit sich bringt. Sie sagt: „Manchmal haben Kinder möglicherweise schwierige Erfahrungen gemacht und brauchen zusätzliche Unterstützung wie eine Therapie, um zu verstehen, was sie durchgemacht haben, und es ist wichtig, dass Pflegeeltern sie dabei unterstützen. Ich kämpfe wirklich dafür, dass alle meine Pflegekinder und Jugendlichen das bekommen, was sie verdienen.“ Nichol glaubt, dass die ständige Unterstützung und das kontinuierliche Training von Barnardo’s es ihr ermöglicht haben, mit schwierigen Zeiten umzugehen. „Mein Sozialarbeiter von Barnardo’s ist wie ein professioneller Freund“, sagt Nichol. „Ich treffe mich regelmäßig mit ihr, aber wenn ich Tag oder Nacht Rat oder Unterstützung brauche, ist immer jemand da, der mir alles gibt, was ich brauche. Es gibt auch immer viele verschiedene Weiterbildungsangebote, und ich besuche jedes Jahr mehrere Kurse. „Bevor Sie als Pflegeperson zugelassen werden, führt Barnardo’s einige wirklich intensive Schulungen durch, um sicherzustellen, dass potenzielle Pflegepersonen sich voll und ganz bewusst sind, was sie möglicherweise erleben. Ihnen liegt nicht nur das Wohl des Kindes am Herzen, sondern auch das der Pflegeeltern.“ Nichols Rat an alle, die eine Pflegefamilie in Betracht ziehen, lautet: „Wenn Sie aus den falschen Gründen in eine Pflegefamilie gehen, werden Sie nicht lange durchhalten. Es ist nicht immer einfach, aber es ist das Belohnendste, was du jemals tun kannst. Für diejenigen, die bereits eigene Kinder haben und sich vielleicht Sorgen darüber machen, ob eine Pflegefamilie die richtige Entscheidung für sie ist, liebt er es meiner Erfahrung nach genauso sehr wie ich, indem er mein Kind in jeden Schritt des Weges einbezieht, und wir würden es tun ' Mir geht es jetzt nicht anders. „Einige meiner Lieblingszeiten sind, wenn wir alle zusammen draußen sitzen und um den Holzofen herum plaudern, und ich bin wirklich glücklich, sie alle zu haben, und ich liebe es, sie so glücklich zu sehen.“ Hinweise für Redakteure Die Daten zeigen die Anzahl der Überweisungen und Anfragen von Pflegepersonen an Barnardo’s von Personen, die zwischen dem 1. März und dem 23. April 2019 und 2020 Pflegeeltern werden möchten, nur in England, Wales und Nordirland. Über Barnardo’s Im ​​vergangenen Jahr wurden rund 300.000 Kinder, Jugendliche, Eltern und Betreuer von Barnardo’s durch mehr als 1.000 Dienste in ganz Großbritannien unterstützt, darunter junge Betreuer, Care Leaver, Pflegebetreuer und Adoptiveltern, Schulungen und Fähigkeiten oder Erziehungskurse.

5225b538	Krankenhäuser haben in nur sechs Jahren 15.000 Betten gestrichen und die Stationen am „Belastungspunkt“ zurückgelassen, wie ein Schockbericht heute enthüllt. Die dramatische Reduzierung – die der Schließung von 24 Krankenhäusern gleichkommt – entspricht einem Rückgang der NHS-Betten um 10 Prozent in einer Zeit, in der das Gesundheitswesen unter beispiellosem Druck steht. Heute stehen den Patienten nachts nur noch 129.458 Krankenhausbetten zur Verfügung, verglichen mit 144.455 im Jahr 2010/11. Kritiker sagen, dass die Sicherheit der Patienten gefährdet ist, und machen die Kürzungen auf eine Besessenheit des NHS zurückzuführen, die Pflege aus Krankenhäusern und „näher ans Haus“ zu verlagern. Die dramatische Reduzierung – die der Schließung von 24 Krankenhäusern gleichkommt – entspricht einem Rückgang der NHS-Betten um 10 Prozent zu einer Zeit, in der das Gesundheitswesen unter beispiellosem Druck steht. Gesundheitsbeamte sagen, dass sich Patienten schneller erholen, wenn sie zu Hause von Hausärzten betreut werden. Bezirkskrankenschwestern und -betreuer, aber viele Praxen und Räte haben nicht die Ressourcen, um Menschen zu versorgen, die zuvor länger im Krankenhaus geblieben wären. Gleichzeitig steigt die Nachfrage nach Betten aufgrund des Drucks einer Sozialkrise, der Einwanderung und einer alternden Bevölkerung, wobei viel mehr Patienten an Langzeitkrankheiten und Gebrechlichkeit erliegen. Neue Zahlen von heute deuten darauf hin, dass sich das Problem wahrscheinlich verschlimmern wird. Die Regulierungsbehörde NHS Improvement wird warnen, dass Krankenhäuser trotz einer Finanzspritze in Höhe von 1,8 Mrd. GBP von der Regierung im vergangenen Jahr bis Ende dieses Jahres ein Defizit von 1 Mrd. GBP erzielen werden. Die Zahlen werden eine neue Debatte darüber auslösen, ob der NHS zu seinen Problemen beiträgt, indem er wertvolle Ressourcen verschwendet. In einem Bericht vom gestrigen Tag hieß es, Krankenhäuser hätten 2 Milliarden Pfund in die Luft gesprengt, indem sie für Artikel wie Toilettenpapier, Jalousien und Feuchttücher zu viel bezahlt hätten, wobei Artikel, die mit der internen Post eines Krankenhauses hätten verschickt werden können, stattdessen von Royal Mail verschickt wurden. Der britische Ärzteverband BMA warnte davor, dass der Verlust von 15.000 Betten „die Patientensicherheit gefährdet“, weil nichts unternommen worden sei, um das Pflegeniveau zu Hause zu verbessern. Aufgrund des Bettenmangels müssen Krankenhäuser Operationen – darunter Krebs- und Herzoperationen – in letzter Minute absagen oder Patienten nach Hause schicken, bevor sie sich richtig erholt haben. Krankenhäuser haben in nur sechs Jahren 15.000 Betten gestrichen und die Stationen am „Belastungspunkt“ gelassen, wie ein Schockbericht heute enthüllt. Der BMA-Bericht hebt auch hervor, dass der NHS weniger Betten pro Kopf hat als fast jedes Land in Europa hat weniger Betten pro Kopf als fast jedes andere Land in Europa. Großbritannien hat durchschnittlich 2,4 Betten pro 1.000 Einwohner, verglichen mit Deutschland 8, Österreich 7,5 und Frankreich 6. Und es gibt Anlass zur Besorgnis über die Belegungsraten auf den Stationen. Krankenhäuser sollen nicht zu mehr als 85 Prozent besetzt sein, aber der Bericht hebt Zahlen hervor, die zeigen, dass neun von zehn dies im Winter überschritten haben. Mehrere Krankenhäuser sind zu 99 oder sogar zu 100 Prozent mit Patienten mit einem viel höheren Infektions- und Vernachlässigungsrisiko belegt. Letzte Woche erfuhr eine Untersuchung, dass Großmutter Mary Muldowney, 57, aus Crawley, West Sussex, an einer Gehirnblutung starb, nachdem drei Krankenhäuser sich geweigert hatten, sie aufzunehmen, weil sie keine Betten hatten. Dr. Mark Porter, Vorsitzender des BMA-Rates, sagte: „Diese Zahlen zeichnen ein noch düstereres Bild eines NHS, der am Bruchpunkt steht. Dr. Mark Porter, Vorsitzender des BMA-Rates, sagte: „Diese Zahlen zeichnen ein noch düstereres Bild eines NHS, der am Bruchpunkt steht. Es führt zu Verzögerungen bei der Aufnahme, Absagen von Operationen und Patienten, die zu Unrecht und manchmal wiederholt im Stich gelassen werden. „Die Verzögerungen, mit denen schutzbedürftige Patienten konfrontiert sind, insbesondere solche mit psychischen Problemen, sind fast zur Norm geworden, und das ist inakzeptabel.“ Die Bettenknappheit wird durch die Bettenblockierungskrise verschärft, die durch die Probleme im Sozialpflegesektor verursacht wird. Aufgrund des Mangels an Haushaltshilfen und Plätzen in Pflegeheimen bleiben ältere und gefährdete Patienten länger im Krankenhaus, als sie sollten. Der frühere Gesundheitsminister, Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb, sagte: „Die Situation wird unerträglich, mit mehr abgesagten Operationen, längeren Verzögerungen und Menschen mit psychischen Gesundheitsproblemen, die systematisch im Stich gelassen werden. Die Regierung finanziert den NHS nicht angemessen, und die Patienten zahlen den Preis.“ Die heutigen Zahlen decken alle Krankenhausbetten ab, einschließlich der Betten auf allgemeinen und Entbindungsstationen sowie in Zentren für psychische Gesundheit und Lernschwierigkeiten. Ein durchschnittliches Krankenhaus hat 634 Betten, ein Verlust von 15.000 Betten entspricht also fast 24 Krankenhäusern. Fiona Johnson von der Denkfabrik Nuffield Trust sagte: „Die extrem hohe Bettenbelegung in Englands Krankenhäusern schafft Schnellkochtopfbedingungen für den NHS. „Das Streben nach Effizienzsteigerungen durch die Reduzierung der Bettenzahl ist kontraproduktiv geworden, da es im System keinen Spielraum gibt, um Nachfragespitzen auszugleichen, und infolgedessen Verzögerungen bei Verfahren und Operationen auftreten.“ Shadow-Gesundheitsminister Jonathan Ashworth sagte: „Die beschämende Realität ist Diese Überbelegung gefährdet Patienten und widerlegt die Behauptungen der Minister, der Sicherheit Vorrang einzuräumen.“ HAUSÄRZTE BIETEN FÜNFMINUTEN-TERMINE AN ​​Hausärzte bieten Patienten dringende Termine an, die nur fünf Minuten dauern, um der steigenden Nachfrage gerecht zu werden. Eine Schnappschuss-Umfrage ergab, dass mehrere Praxen die gleichen Tageszeiten für alle anbieten, die denken, dass sie sofort gesehen werden müssen. Dazu gehören Eltern, die sich Sorgen um kranke Kinder machen oder Patienten mit Brustschmerzen oder Atembeschwerden. Hausarzttermine in England dauern in der Regel zehn Minuten und gehören bereits zu den kürzesten in Europa. Dr. Chaand Nagpaul von der British Medical Association sagte: „Fünf Minuten sind bedauerlicherweise zu kurz. „Neun von zehn Hausärzten geben an, dass sie mit zehnminütigen Terminen nicht zurechtkommen.“ Ein Sprecher von NHS England sagte: „Moderne Behandlungsfortschritte wie minimal-invasive Chirurgie, schnell wirkende Anästhetika und zu Hause eingenommene Medikamente bedeuten, dass die Patienten länger verweilen Krankenhausausgaben sind in allen westlichen Ländern gesunken. „Der NHS ist insgesamt sehr effizient, aber es gibt immer noch bedeutende Unterschiede bei den Entlassungspraktiken und der Unterstützung der Gemeinde in ganz England.“ Das Gesundheitsministerium sagte: Unsere Krankenhäuser sind beschäftigter als je zuvor, aber dank der harten Arbeit des Personals sind unsere Leistungen immer noch unter den Besten die besten der Welt. Wir haben den eigenen Zukunftsplan des NHS mit zusätzlichen 10 Milliarden Pfund bis 2020 unterstützt.“	NHS streicht 15.000 Betten in sechs Jahren	other

Der Premierminister ist in den letzten Tagen unter Beschuss geraten, als er Großbritannien aufforderte, angesichts der beispiellosen Zahl von Migrantentragödien im Mittelmeerraum eine größere Zahl syrischer Flüchtlinge aufzunehmen. Seine Entscheidung, mehr Flüchtlinge aus Lagern an den Grenzen des vom Krieg zerrütteten Syriens aufzunehmen, kam kurz nachdem herzzerreißende Fotos von zwei toten syrischen Jungen, die an einen türkischen Strand gespült wurden, im Internet zu kursieren begannen. Herr Cameron sagte, er sei von den Bildern „zutiefst bewegt“ und machte den Islamischen Staat ISIS, kriminelle Banden und den syrischen Präsidenten Baschar al-Assad für ihren Tod verantwortlich. Heute sagte er: Als Vater und als Mensch können Sie nicht anders, als von diesen schrecklichen Bildern bewegt zu werden, wenn Sie das Bild dieses armen Kindes am Strand in der Türkei sehen. Diese Bilder werden uns alle sehr, sehr lange begleiten. Aber die Frage, die Sie sich nicht nur als Vater, sondern auch als Premierminister stellen müssen, lautet: Welche Maßnahmen können wir ergreifen, um wirklich etwas zu bewegen? Deshalb halte ich es für wichtig, zusätzliche Flüchtlinge aus syrischen Flüchtlingslagern aufzunehmen, weil wir natürlich jedem, den wir aufnehmen, eine neue Chance und ein neues Leben bieten können. Ich möchte die Botschaft aussenden, dass der beste Weg zu einem neuen Leben darin besteht, diese gefährliche Reise nicht zu machen. AP Tima Kurdi berührt ein Foto ihrer Neffen Aylan und Galib Kurdi Downing Street lehnte es ab, eine genaue Zahl der Syrer zu nennen, die in das Land aufgenommen werden, und sagte, dass die Einzelheiten des Programms fertiggestellt würden und nächste Woche bekannt gegeben würden . Die zusätzliche Finanzierungszusage von 100 Millionen Pfund für Flüchtlingslager an Syriens Grenzen bringt den Gesamtbeitrag des Vereinigten Königreichs auf mehr als 1 Milliarde Pfund und ist damit Großbritanniens größte Reaktion auf eine humanitäre Krise, sagte Herr Cameron. Während Europa mit der größten Flüchtlingskrise seiner Geschichte zu kämpfen hat, hat sich in der EU eine dramatische Ost-West-Spaltung gebildet. Brüssel, Deutschland und Frankreich wollen alle EU-Staaten – einschließlich Großbritannien – zwingen, ihren Anteil an bis zu 160.000 Flüchtlingen zu übernehmen. Aber Ungarn, das die Hauptlast des jüngsten Zustroms von Migranten getragen hat, und Polen weigern sich standhaft, weitere aufzunehmen, und bestehen darauf, dass dies nicht ihr Problem sei. Die Äußerungen von Herrn Cameron kamen, als der französische Präsident Francois Hollande dem Vereinigten Königreich einen kaum verhüllten Schlag versetzte, indem er sich beschwerte, dass einige Länder „ihren moralischen Verpflichtungen nicht nachkommen“. Frankreich und Deutschland hatten sich zuvor darauf geeinigt, ein dauerhaftes und verbindliches System zur Aufnahme von Flüchtlingen und Asylsuchenden, insbesondere Syrern, in der Europäischen Union vorzuschlagen. „Ich glaube, dass das, was wir heute getan haben, nicht ausreicht“, sagte Hollande in Paris. „Es gibt Länder – ich werde sie hier nicht nennen, weil wir hier sind, um mit allen zusammenzuarbeiten – und diese Länder kommen ihren moralischen Verpflichtungen nicht nach.“ REUTERS Verzweifelte Migrantenfamilie auf den Gleisen in Bicske, Ungarn, gestern Bei der Ankündigung des Migrantenabkommens sagte Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel: „Die französisch-deutsche Position, die wir den europäischen Institutionen übermitteln werden, ist, dass wir uns darin einig sind, dass wir verbindliche Quoten brauchen die Europäische Union, die Last zu teilen. Das ist das Solidaritätsprinzip.“ Sie sagte, die „Wirtschaftskraft und Größe der Länder sollten eine Rolle spielen“ bei der Zahl der Migranten, die sie aufnehmen sollen, betonte aber, dass „wir dieses Problem ohne Quoten nicht lösen können“. Es stellte sich auch heraus, dass die Staats- und Regierungschefs der EU einen Plan zur Umverteilung von 160.000 Flüchtlingen auf dem gesamten Kontinent ausgearbeitet haben. Im Rahmen des neuen Programms, das vom Präsidenten der Europäischen Kommission, Jean-Claude Juncker, geleitet wird, werden Migranten, die in Italien, Griechenland und Ungarn gestrandet sind, auf der Grundlage ihrer Bevölkerung und ihres wirtschaftlichen Wohlstands in Länder in der ganzen EU überstellt. Deutschland wird 35.000 Flüchtlingen Asyl gewähren, Frankreich 26.000 und Spanien 16.000 aufnehmen. Bulgarien und Rumänien werden voraussichtlich Tausende von Familien aufnehmen. Großbritannien weigerte sich Anfang dieses Jahres, sich dem Programm anzuschließen. Über den Plan zeichneten sich jedoch bereits Spaltungen ab. EU-Präsident Donald Tusk räumte ein, dass es eine „Kluft zwischen dem Osten und dem Westen der EU“ über den Plan gebe, alle Länder zu zwingen, einen Teil der Flüchtlinge aufzunehmen.

Aber der ungarische Premierminister Viktor Orban, der Gespräche mit Herrn Tusk führte, sagte, dass der Migrantenstrom ein „deutsches Problem“ sei. „Das Problem ist kein europäisches Problem, das Problem ist ein deutsches Problem. Niemand möchte in Ungarn bleiben, weder in der Slowakei noch in Polen oder Estland. Alle würden gerne nach Deutschland gehen“, sagte er. Er forderte Kritiker auf, Ungarn nicht mehr für die Krise verantwortlich zu machen, und sagte, dass die Entscheidung seines Landes, Flüchtlinge zur Registrierung zu zwingen, nur die Einhaltung der EU-Vorschriften bedeute, bevor er hinzufügte, dass die Europäer „voller Angst seien, weil sie sehen, dass die europäischen Führer ... nicht in der Lage sind um die Situation zu kontrollieren.“ „Ungarn hat alles getan, um die Vorschriften zu erfüllen“, sagte Orban. „Kritisieren Sie Ungarn nicht dafür, dass es das tut, was obligatorisch ist.“ Der kämpferische Rechtspolitiker argumentierte auch, dass Europas Politik der offenen Tür die Krise schüre. „Wenn wir ... den Eindruck erwecken würden, dass ‚nur kommen, weil wir bereit sind, alle aufzunehmen‘, wäre das ein moralisches Versagen. Die moralisch-menschliche Sache ist, deutlich zu machen: Bitte kommen Sie nicht“, sagte er. „Die Türkei ist ein sicheres Land. Bleib hier. Es ist riskant zu kommen. Es ist besser für die Familie, für die Kinder, für sich selbst zu bleiben.“ AP Aylan Kurdi, links, und sein Bruder Galib Kurdi.

59a9ea73	"Das Haus des Herzogs und der Herzogin von Sussex wurde mit 2,4 Millionen Pfund an vom Steuerzahler finanzierten Kosten renoviert, wie königliche Konten zeigen. Frogmore Cottage in Windsor wurde aus fünf separaten Häusern in ein einziges Anwesen für Prinz Harry und Meghan umgewandelt. Das Paar, das im April vor der Geburt ihres Sohnes Archie aus dem Kensington Palace gezogen war, bezahlte die Anprobe. Der Sovereign Grant der Königin aus dem Finanzministerium belief sich 2018-19 auf 82 Millionen Pfund, wobei 33 Millionen Pfund für die Instandhaltung vorgesehen waren, einschließlich größerer Arbeiten am Buckingham Palace. Der Sovereign Grant wird aus Gewinnen des Crown Estate finanziert. Das Anwesen ist der Gewerbeimmobilienzweig der königlichen Familie und besitzt Grundstücke und Gebäude in erstklassigen Lagen im Zentrum Londons und in ganz Großbritannien. Es wird von einer unabhängigen Organisation verwaltet, wobei alle Gewinne zum Nutzen aller britischen Steuerzahler an das Finanzministerium gezahlt werden. Separate Konten zeigen, dass das Crown Estate dem Finanzministerium in den Jahren 2018-19 eine Rekordsumme von 343,5 Mio. £ zur Verfügung gestellt hat, was einem Anstieg von 4,3 % gegenüber dem Vorjahr entspricht. ""Unsere Verantwortung"" Die königlichen Konten sagten, dass die Renovierung von Frogmore Cottage aus dem Sovereign Grant bezahlt wurde und die Neukonfiguration und vollständige Renovierung von fünf Wohneinheiten in schlechtem Zustand beinhaltete, um die offizielle Residenz für den Herzog und die Herzogin von Sussex zu schaffen. Das denkmalgeschützte Eigentum aus dem 19. Jahrhundert wurde ihnen von der Königin geschenkt. Es befindet sich auf dem Gelände der königlichen Residenz Frogmore House, wo Prinz Harry und Meghan im Mai 2018 ihren Hochzeitsempfang abhielten. Wer lebte in Harrys und Meghans Haus? Harry und Meghan trennten sich von der königlichen Wohltätigkeitsorganisation Harry und Meghan ziehen nach Windsor MPs zurück 369 Millionen Pfund Umbau des Buckingham Palace Defekte hölzerne Deckenbalken und Bodenbalken wurden ersetzt und ineffiziente Heizsysteme aktualisiert. Das Haus erforderte außerdem eine umfangreiche Neuverkabelung – einschließlich einer Umspannstation – und die Installation von Gas- und Wasserleitungen. Die Renovierung dauerte etwa sechs Monate, obwohl einige Bereiche noch abgeschlossen werden müssen, wie z. B. die Neulackierung der Außenseite. Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, sagte: Das Anwesen war seit einigen Jahren nicht mehr Gegenstand von Arbeiten und war bereits für die Renovierung vorgesehen, in Übereinstimmung mit unserer Verantwortung, den Zustand des besetzten königlichen Palastes zu erhalten. Der Herzog und die Herzogin von Cambridge führten auch Renovierungsarbeiten durch, bevor sie 2013 in ihr Haus im Kensington Palace zogen, und gaben mehr als 4 Millionen Pfund für die Umwandlung von Büros in eine Wohnung aus. Steuerzahlerfinanzierte Ausgaben für die Royals sind seit Jahrzehnten ein heikles Thema. Aus diesem Grund gaben sich die Palastbeamten alle Mühe, um zu erklären, wie viel mit Frogmore Cottage zu tun war und wie alles, was über die grundlegende Einrichtung und Ausstattung hinausging, vom Paar selbst bezahlt werden würde. Der Sovereign Grant soll die Kosten für amtliche Aufgaben und für den Unterhalt der königlichen Paläste decken. Einige werden sich jedoch fragen, warum das Paar aus dem Kensington Palace ausziehen musste? Und warum, wenn es ihnen so wichtig war, haben sie die Renovierung des Hauses in Windsor nicht selbst bezahlt? Präsentatorische graue Linie Der staatliche Kernzuschuss der königlichen Familie basiert auf 15 % des Nettoüberschusses des Kronguts und wird zwei Jahre rückwirkend zugeteilt. Von 2017 bis 2018 wurde der Gesamtzuschuss für einen Zeitraum von 10 Jahren auf 25 % des Überschusses erhöht – wobei die zusätzlichen Mittel zur Deckung der Kosten von 369 Millionen Pfund für die Renovierung des Buckingham Palace bestimmt waren. Ohne Geld, das für zukünftige Bauarbeiten im Palast in die Reserven überwiesen wurde, beliefen sich die offiziellen Ausgaben der Königin im vergangenen Jahr auf 67 Millionen Pfund, was einer Steigerung von 41 % gegenüber dem Vorjahr entspricht, wie die Zahlen zeigen. Ein großer Teil des Anstiegs war auf die laufende Renovierung des Buckingham Palace und die Arbeiten an den anderen besetzten königlichen Residenzen zurückzuführen. Die Kampagnengruppe Republic stellte in Frage, warum Geld für Frogmore Cottage ausgegeben wurde, als die öffentlichen Dienste unter finanziellem Druck standen. Graham Smith von der Republik forderte eine parlamentarische Untersuchung der königlichen Ausgaben und fügte hinzu: Die allgemeinen Mittel des Finanzministeriums sollten überhaupt nicht für einzelne Mitglieder der königlichen Familie ausgegeben werden – selbst wenn wir das gesamte Geld hätten, um es für öffentliche Dienste auszugeben sollte nicht passieren. Präsentatorische graue Linie Was ist das Krongut? Ein unabhängiges Gewerbeimmobilienunternehmen und eines der größten Immobilienportfolios im Vereinigten Königreich. Der Großteil der Vermögenswerte befindet sich in London, aber das Anwesen besitzt auch Immobilien in Schottland, Wales und Nordirland besteht aus Wohnimmobilien, Gewerbebüros, Geschäften, Unternehmen und Fachmarktzentren.

Dem Bericht zufolge stiegen die CO2-Emissionen von Flügen, die bei offiziellen königlichen Besuchen in Übersee in den Jahren 2018-19 genutzt wurden, um 98 % – von 1.687 auf 3.344 Tonnen CO2. Der Buckingham Palace sagte, der Anstieg sei auf die stärkere Nutzung gecharterter großer Starrflügelflugzeuge für Auslandsgeschäftsreisen zurückzuführen, und fügte hinzu, dass es 2018-19 fünf solcher Auslandsbesuche im Vergleich zu einem im Vorjahr gab. Über die Reisen entscheidet das Auswärtige Amt. Die Konten zeigen auch, dass der Herzog von Edinburgh ein Büro mit einer Privatsekretärin unterhält und 359.000 Pfund Rente vom Finanzministerium erhält. Obwohl er sich 2017 von öffentlichen Pflichten zurückzog, unterhält Prinz Philip eine offizielle Beziehung zu Hunderten von Organisationen und Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen. Unabhängig davon bezahlt der Prinz von Wales die öffentlichen Pflichten von Prinz Harry und Meghan sowie des Herzogs und der Herzogin von Cambridge und einige ihrer privaten Kosten aus dem Einkommen seines Herzogtums Cornwall, das letztes Jahr 21,6 Millionen Pfund betrug. Konten von Clarence House zeigen, dass diese Finanzierung – in dem Jahr, in dem Meghan offiziell der königlichen Familie beitrat – etwas mehr als 5 Millionen Pfund betrug, was einem Anstieg von 1,8 % gegenüber 2017-18 entspricht. Die Zahl beinhaltete auch einige der Kapitalausgaben von Prinz Charles und die Übertragung in die Reserven."

1c068671	Der Druck auf die Regierung, den kämpfenden Briten zu helfen, hat zugenommen, nachdem eine führende Denkfabrik davor gewarnt hatte, dass der sinkende Lebensstandard der Armen den größten Anstieg der Ungleichheit seit der Amtszeit von Premierministerin Margaret Thatcher bedrohe. Die Resolution Foundation sagte, Theresa May müsse ihr Versprechen einlösen, Haushalte „nur über die Verwaltung“ zu unterstützen, da sie einen Bericht veröffentlichte, aus dem hervorgeht, dass die steigende Inflation und ein Ende des jüngsten starken Beschäftigungswachstums die am wenigsten wohlhabenden am härtesten treffen würden. Seine Warnungen stimmen mit anderen Prognosen überein, dass die Familienbudgets aufgrund des schleppenden Lohnwachstums, Sozialabbaus, steigender globaler Ölpreise und des starken Rückgangs des Pfunds seit dem Brexit-Votum knapp werden. Der Rückgang des Pfund Sterling hat Importe teurer gemacht und es gibt bereits Anzeichen dafür, dass dies an die Verbraucher weitergegeben wird, da die Inflation im Dezember den höchsten Stand seit mehr als zwei Jahren erreicht. Die Studie der Resolution Foundation ergab, dass das derzeitige Parlament den schlechtesten Lebensstandard für die ärmste Hälfte der Haushalte seit Beginn vergleichbarer Aufzeichnungen Mitte der 1960er Jahre und das schlechteste seit den frühen Jahren von Thatchers Ministerpräsidentenamt 1979-90 wegen Ungleichheit darstellen würde. Seit ihrem starken Anstieg in den frühen 1980er Jahren – einer Zeit hoher Arbeitslosigkeit, Fabrikschließungen und einer Senkung des Spitzensteuersatzes von 83 % auf 60 % – ist die Ungleichheit weitgehend unverändert geblieben. Aber die Resolution Foundation prognostiziert, dass zwischen 2015 und den nächsten Parlamentswahlen im Jahr 2020 die Einkommen der ärmsten Hälfte der Haushalte um 2 % sinken werden. Dem steht ein Anstieg von 4 % während des letzten Parlaments und 1 % zwischen 2005 und 2010 gegenüber – dem Fünfjahreszeitraum mit der tiefsten Rezession seit den 1930er Jahren. Torsten Bell, Direktor der Resolution Foundation, sagte: „Großbritannien hat in den letzten Jahren einen willkommenen Miniboom des Lebensstandards erlebt. Aber dieser Boom verlangsamt sich rapide, da die Inflation steigt, die Produktivität stagniert und sich das Beschäftigungswachstum verlangsamt. „Der Engpass im Zuge der Finanzkrise hat tendenziell die wohlhabenderen Haushalte am stärksten getroffen. Aber dieses Mal sind es Familien mit niedrigem und mittlerem Einkommen mit Kindern, die am stärksten betroffen sein werden. „Dies könnte Großbritannien den schlechtesten Lebensstandard aus beiden Welten bescheren – das schwache Einkommenswachstum des letzten Parlaments und die zunehmende Ungleichheit seit Margaret Thatchers Zeit in der Downing Street. „Die Fokussierung des Premierministers auf die Unterstützung des reinen Familienmanagements ist absolut richtig, wenn wir vermeiden wollen, dass die nächsten Jahre wie die 1980er ohne Wohlfühlfaktor werden.“ Die Prognose, dass die Ungleichheit wieder zunehmen wird, basiert auf der Prognose der Denkfabrik, dass die Einkommen für die ärmere Hälfte der Haushalte zwar sinken, aber für das reichste Fünftel in den nächsten vier Jahren um etwa 5 % steigen werden. Die Stiftung macht für den bevorstehenden Rückgang des Lebensstandards eine Kombination aus stagnierenden Löhnen, steigender Inflation und der Einführung von Sozialkürzungen in Höhe von mehr als 12 Milliarden Pfund verantwortlich. Sie betonte, dass die Schwäche des Pfunds seit dem Brexit-Votum und andere wirtschaftliche Faktoren wie ein flaches Produktivitätswachstum nur ein Teil des Bildes seien. Die ungleiche Art des Engpasses wäre das Ergebnis der Steuer- und Leistungspolitik der Regierung. „Das Votum für den Austritt aus der Europäischen Union scheint sich bisher nicht auf die Makroökonomie oder die Beschäftigung ausgewirkt zu haben, aber es hat das Ende der extrem niedrigen Inflation beschleunigt und erhöht, wie weit sie in den nächsten Jahren voraussichtlich steigen wird. “, heißt es in dem Bericht. „Aber in gewisser Weise entscheidet sich Großbritannien unabhängig vom durchschnittlichen Wachstum des Haushaltseinkommens auch aktiv dafür, die Ungleichheit zu erhöhen. Trotz willkommener Maßnahmen wie dem nationalen existenzsichernden Lohn werden die Pläne, die der neue Premierminister geerbt hat, wahrscheinlich dafür sorgen, dass die Wachstumserlöse ungleich verteilt werden und viele Familien schlechter gestellt werden.“ Der Thinktank geht davon aus, dass die Ungleichheit bis 2020 auf Rekordhöhen ansteigen wird, und zwar anhand von drei verschiedenen Maßstäben: dem Einkommensverhältnis von 90:10, das dem Einkommen eines Haushalts entspricht, das auf der Einkommensverteilungsskala zu 90 % höher liegt, dividiert durch das eines Haushalts, das nur 10 % höher liegt ; auf dem 80:20-Verhältnis, berechnet auf ähnliche Weise aus den 80 % nach oben der Verteilung und den 20 % nach oben; und auf der Palma-Quote der Einkommensanteil der oberen 10 % dividiert durch den Einkommensanteil der unteren 40 %. „Alle prognostizierten Maßnahmen zeigen einen starken Anstieg der Ungleichheit in den nächsten vier Jahren, wobei alle bis 2020-21 Rekordhöhen erreichen. Dies ist ein völlig anderes Muster als der Trend der letzten 20 Jahre, in denen die Ungleichheit weitgehend unverändert oder sogar rückläufig war“, heißt es in dem Bericht. Die Resolution Foundation unterstrich die Herausforderung für die Regierung von May, die versucht, tiefe regionale Ungleichgewichte im Vereinigten Königreich auszugleichen, und hob auch die anhaltenden Ungleichheiten zwischen Südostengland und dem Rest des Landes hervor. Die Einkommen in der überwiegenden Mehrheit des Landes waren mehr als 10 % niedriger als in der wohlhabendsten Region, Südostengland, so die Analyse. Nordostengland und die West Midlands hatten das niedrigste Einkommensniveau, beide 20 % niedriger als im Südosten. In Bezug auf die Hauptstadt fügte der Bericht hinzu: „Entgegen vielleicht allgemeiner Meinungen ist London nicht die Region mit dem höchsten Einkommen, und wenn man die Wohnkosten berücksichtigt, sind die Einkommen in der Region etwa 10 % niedriger als im Südosten.“ Ein Sprecher des Finanzministeriums sagte: „Der Lebensstandard erreichte 2015 den höchsten Stand aller Zeiten und wird voraussichtlich bis zum Ende der Parlamentsperiode noch höher sein. „Millionen von Menschen nehmen mehr von dem, was sie verdienen, mit nach Hause, dank der Maßnahmen der Regierung zur Senkung der Einkommensteuerrechnungen und zur Einführung des nationalen Existenzminimums. Wir helfen Haushalten bei den Lebenshaltungskosten, indem wir das Angebot an bezahlbarem Wohnraum erhöhen, Maklergebühren verbieten und die Kraftstoffsteuer einfrieren, und unsere Investitionen zur Steigerung der Produktivität werden den Lebensstandard langfristig erhöhen.“ John McDonnell, der Schattenkanzler, sagte, die Resolution Foundation sei vernichtend: „Labour forderte die Regierung in der Herbsterklärung auf, die unfairen Kürzungen der Arbeitsleistungen zu beenden, während sie mit Steuergeschenken an eine wohlhabende Minderheit, aber Philip Hammond, fortfuhren beschloss, die Arbeit seines Vorgängers fortzusetzen. „Es wird von Tag zu Tag klarer, dass arbeitende Familien gezwungen sein werden, für einen Tory-Brexit zu zahlen, der die Reichen begünstigt und nicht den Rest von uns, da unser Land mit dem größten Anstieg der Ungleichheit seit Margaret Thatcher konfrontiert ist.“	Großbritannien steht vor einer Rückkehr zur Ungleichheit der Thatcher-Jahre, sagt der Bericht	other
2574e017	Doc fordert Rückkehr zu Verhandlungen Von DR. JONATHAN STANLEY 12. Januar 2016, 00:01 Uhr Aktualisiert: 6. April 2016, 09:54 Uhr HEUTE gehen meine Kollegen in den Streik. Es ist beispiellos, bedroht die Würde und Sicherheit der Patienten – und es ist unnötig. Für mich ist es auch illegal. Aus diesem Grund fordere ich heute – zusammen mit der Denkfabrik Bow Group – die British Medical Association BMA auf, ihre Streiks einzustellen und zu den Verhandlungen zurückzukehren, um die Einigung zu erzielen, die wir alle brauchen. Ausgeklügelte Taktiken von Gesundheitsminister Jeremy Hunt führten dazu, dass die Regierung zu hart in Gespräche einstieg, denen sich keiner von uns entziehen kann. Deshalb wurde eine Abstimmung durchgeführt. Aber selbst im November gab es keinen Grund, warum die BMA nicht zuerst zu den Vermittlern Acas hätte gehen können, bevor sie den Einsatz erhöhten. Niemand kann ehrlich sagen, dass die Ärzte oder die angebotenen Bedingungen dieselben sind wie bei der Abstimmung. Für mich endete das Streikmandat, als die Acas-Gespräche begannen. LESEN SIE MEHR: Corbyns Mob im Doc-Streik, während Momentum Linke schickt, um sich Streikposten anzuschließen Als die laufenden Gespräche abgebrochen wurden, sahen wir alle, wie BMA-Vertreter die Medien darüber informierten, wie schlecht die ganze Sache lief. Unionsbonzen in der Nähe von Labour-Führer Jeremy Corbyn drehten die Hitze auf und die Gespräche brachen natürlich zusammen. Da Labour kaum eine Chance hat, bald an die Macht zurückzukehren, sehen wir jetzt Corbyns „neue Art von Politik“ – eine Rückkehr zu direkten Aktionen, um die Regierung zu untergraben, komme was wolle. Seine Freunde in meiner Gewerkschaft nutzen das Vertrauen und den guten Willen, den wir jahrelang aufgebaut haben, und bewaffnen meine Kollegen und unsere Patienten. Den Opfern der jüngsten Überschwemmungen, die so viel verloren haben und deren Operationen abgesagt wurden, wurde keine Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt. Angesichts dieser Streiks ist es Unsinn zu sagen, dass wir Krebs rechtzeitig diagnostizieren und behandeln können oder dass wir weiterhin Menschen mit psychischen Gesundheitsproblemen behandeln können. Und es ist Unsinn zu sagen, dass der ganze Berufsstand hinter den Streiks steckt – so viele Noten wurden nicht einmal gewählt. Es gibt viele verschiedene Stimmen, die sagen, wie viele Patienten an Wochenenden und während dieser Streiks an Unterbesetzung sterben könnten. Die Forschung, an der ich mit der Bow Group gearbeitet habe, deutet darauf hin, dass in den drei Tagen des Arbeitskampfes in diesem Monat mehr als zweihundert Menschenleben verloren gehen könnten. Diese Debatte hat auch unsere menschliche Seite. Tausende von uns haben hart gearbeitet, um in die Medizin zu kommen. Wir sehen so viele Patienten, die an ihren Krankheiten leiden, und fühlen uns privilegiert, da zu sein, um ihnen so gut wie möglich zu helfen. Ich arbeite seit 2005 als Ärztin. Ich sehe die Verwüstung, wenn sich eine Operation verzögert, die Qual, wenn ein Krebs zu spät entdeckt wird. Mich mehr zu bezahlen oder weniger zu arbeiten, wird niemals abstumpfen, was ich sehe. Faire Löhne sind fair, und ich unterstütze die BMA dabei, sich dafür einzusetzen. Gespräche scheitern ... Dr. Stanley macht Corbyns „neue Art von Politik“ für den Zusammenbruch verantwortlich Reuters 1 Wir alle wollen faire Bezahlung durch Verhandlungen. Aber es gibt viele Aspekte der Sicherheit, die in den aktuellen Gesprächen nicht einmal angesprochen wurden. Beispielsweise würde die Änderung unserer Dienstpläne, sodass leitende Ärzte im August – wenn neu qualifizierte Ärzte beginnen – zwei Wochen länger bleiben können, den neuen Ärzten helfen, ihre Karriere in einem sichereren und unterstützenderen Umfeld zu beginnen. Ich habe es satt zu hören, wie meine Kollegen das Land verlassen, wenn sie nicht alles bekommen, was sie wollen, dass sie irgendwie in ein Flugzeug zum Great Barrier Reef gezwungen werden. Niemand zwingt irgendjemanden, etwas zu tun, und wir haben eine Schuld zurückzuzahlen. Ärzte sind einer von acht aller NHS-Mitarbeiter, aber wir erhalten drei Fünftel des Schulungsbudgets. Das ist natürlich großartig, denn wir brauchen wirklich die beste Ausbildung, um Sie zu behandeln. Aber warum können wir keine Rückforderungen in unsere Verträge schreiben, sodass wir unsere Ausbildung zurückzahlen müssen, wenn wir als Berater in wärmere Gefilde gehen? Die Ausbildung eines Hausarztes kostet 400.000 Pfund – und für Chirurgen und Kardiologen sind es sogar noch mehr. Zweitausend leitende Ärzte, die Großbritannien verlassen, würden uns eine Milliarde kosten. Allein im vergangenen Jahr bewarben sich mehr als doppelt so viele um eine Stelle im Ausland. Aber angesichts der so großen Konkurrenz um Ausbildung und Medizinstudium muss ich zugeben, dass wir zu leicht mit denen umgegangen sind, die mit der Beute davonlaufen wollen. In der Tat, wenn wir dieses Schlupfloch schließen würden, hätte Jeremy Hunt vielleicht mehr Geld, das er für Krankenschwestern, Medikamente und, ja, auch für die Erhöhung unseres Gehalts ausgeben könnte. Ich habe E-Mails und Briefings von BMA-Unterhändlern gesehen, die die Regierung angriffen, Hunt einen Lügner nannten und andere Gewerkschaften und linke Gruppen aufforderten, sich den Streikposten anzuschließen. Ich werde die Vertraulichkeit nicht verletzen, indem ich diese Dokumente veröffentliche, Sie müssen mich beim Wort nehmen. Diese Briefings sind nicht in meinem Namen und sie repräsentieren nicht die Ansichten der meisten jungen Ärzte, die ich kenne. Sie machen mir klar, dass es Elemente der BMA gibt, die einen Streik wollten, sobald sie ihre Stimmzettel erhalten haben, und nicht die Absicht haben, zu den Gesprächen zurückzukehren. Wo bleibt die Öffentlichkeit? Streiks, fürchte ich, werden an Zahl und Heftigkeit zunehmen. Vielleicht eilt Corbyn rechtzeitig zu den Kommunalwahlen im Mai zur Rettung und rettet den Tag vor den Streiks, die er veranlasst hat. Er könnte sogar einige seiner Labour-Freunde innerhalb des Berufsstandes belohnen, aber das Endergebnis wird eine Verschwörung gegen die Öffentlichkeit und die Patienten sein. Ich unterstütze den BMA, ich bin seit zehn Jahren Mitglied. Sie leistet für Ärzte lebenswichtige Arbeit und dient letztlich unser aller Interessen. Aber sie hat einigen Mitgliedern mit einer radikal linken Agenda, die sich stark von der der Gewerkschaft unterscheidet, erlaubt, sie zu kapern. Ich werde Freunde verlieren, wenn ich dieses Versäumnis, Streiks wo möglich zu vermeiden, hervorrufe. Ich erinnere mich an meine frühen Tage der Ausbildung an der Sheffield Medical School und ihr Motto scheint durch: „Die Kunst ist lang und das Leben ist kurz.“ Das Ansehen, Vertrauen und Vermächtnis der Ärzteschaft ist größer als dieser Showdown – und das muss es sein. Es gibt einen Unterschied zwischen einem Profi und einem Angestellten. Dies ist ein Mitarbeiterstreit, aber wir sind Fachleute, die für das Leben der Nation von entscheidender Bedeutung sind. Wir müssen anfangen, uns so zu verhalten. — Dr. Jonathan Stanley ist Arzt in der Ausbildung und Mitglied des Royal College of Surgeons.

9b14da53	Die Nachwuchsärzte in England haben im Streit mit den Ministern um einen neuen Vertrag mit überwältigender Mehrheit für einen Streik gestimmt. Etwa 98 % stimmten für einen vollständigen Streik und 99 % für Maßnahmen kurz vor einem vollständigen Streik. Der erste Walk-out beginnt am 1. Dezember, zwei weitere Termine sind für später im Monat vorgesehen. Gesundheitsminister Jeremy Hunt sagte, die Entscheidung der Ärzte sei eine sehr, sehr enttäuschende Nachricht. Und er lehnte Aufrufe zu Gesprächen beim Schlichtungsdienst Acas ab, obwohl er es nicht ganz ausschließen würde. Eine Studie nach der anderen hat gezeigt, dass unsere Sterblichkeitsraten an Wochenenden zu hoch sind, sagte er. MedienunterschriftVollständig: Jeremy Hunt-Interview mit Laura Kuenssberg Wir haben ein sehr faires Angebot für Ärzte vorgelegt, bei dem drei Viertel der Assistenzärzte besser bezahlt werden. Wir wollten mit ihnen darüber reden, aber am Ende haben sie sich entschieden zu streiken, also müssen wir Notfallpläne aufstellen. Er sagte auch, dass das Angebot der Regierung falsch dargestellt worden sei. „Unsicherer Vertrag“ Der britische Ärzteverband BMA sagte, es sei unvermeidlich, dass die Patienten infolge der Streiks gestört würden, behauptete jedoch, dass ihm keine andere Wahl gelassen worden sei, da der Vertrag unsicher sei. Die Aktion wird wahrscheinlich dazu führen, dass Tausende von Routineterminen, Tests und Operationen abgesagt und verschoben werden, wobei der NHS gezwungen ist, Notfälle zu priorisieren. Die Gewerkschaft hat den Beratungs-, Schlichtungs- und Schiedsdienst Acas gebeten, sich zu engagieren, um ein unabhängiges Schiedsverfahren anzubieten – etwas, das die Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, die sich normalerweise aus der Politik heraushält, unterstützt. Die Termine für Arbeitskampfmaßnahmen sind: 08:00 GMT 1. Dezember bis 08:00 GMT 2. Dezember Assistenzärzte zum Personal der Notfallversorgung 08:00 GMT bis 17:00 8. Dezember voller Streik 08:00 GMT bis 17:00 16. Dezember voller Streik Der BMA wählte etwas mehr als 37.700 Mitglieder – mehr als zwei Drittel der Belegschaft – und 76 % nahmen an der Abstimmung teil. Attentate von Paris: Der junge Arzt, der die ersten Verletzten behandelte Was passiert bei einem Streik? Doctorimage copyrightPA-Dienste werden unterbrochen, machen Sie sich nichts vor. Aber die British Medical Association argumentiert, dass das Ziel der teilnehmenden Ärzte nicht darin bestehen wird, dies zu maximieren – wie es das Ziel in vielen anderen Arbeitskämpfen ist. Am ersten vorgesehenen Einsatztag wird die Notfallversorgung noch von Assistenzärzten besetzt. An den anderen beiden Terminen werden sie in dem Wissen aussteigen, dass es andere Mediziner - Berater, Personalärzte und Stellvertreter - geben wird, die die Lücken schließen können. Ob das für stark bedrängte Rettungsdienste ausreicht, wird vor, während und nach jedem Streik diskutiert. Sicher ist jedoch, dass Routinedienste darunter leiden werden. Hüftoperationen, Kniegelenkersatz und Routinekliniken müssen abgesagt werden. Wie beim letzten Mal, als Ärzte 2012 wegen der Renten Maßnahmen ergriffen haben, erwarten die Krankenhäuser tatsächlich, dass sie im Voraus mit der Neuordnung der Dienstleistungen beginnen. Möchten Sie mehr über den Streit erfahren? Die Assistenzarztreihe erklärt Was genau machen Assistenzärzte? Ein Albtraum für den NHS und die Patienten. Wie sieht Ihr Job im Vergleich dazu aus? NHS gegen Minister: Ein Fall von Déjà-vu? Die Abstimmung erfolgt, nachdem sich in den vergangenen Monaten tausende Ärzte an einer Reihe von Protesten im Vertragsstreit beteiligt haben. Die Gespräche brachen letztes Jahr zusammen, und die Minister haben seitdem erklärt, dass sie den neuen Vertrag ab dem nächsten Jahr durchsetzen werden. Als die Stimmzettel vor zwei Wochen ausgingen, unternahm Gesundheitsminister Jeremy Hunt einen letzten verzweifelten Versuch, die Ärzte davon zu überzeugen, das Angebot anzunehmen. Er schrieb alle Ärzte im Land mit einem neuen Angebot an. Es enthielt ein Versprechen einer 11%igen Erhöhung des Grundgehalts, aber die BMA sagte, dies sei irreführend, da es durch Einschränkungen anderer Elemente des Gehaltspakets, einschließlich unsozialer Stundenzahlungen, ausgeglichen wurde. Die Minister haben versprochen, die Löhne für die ersten drei Jahre des Abkommens zu schützen. Das BMA hat jedoch erklärt, dass es unzureichende Schutzmaßnahmen gibt, um zu verhindern, dass Krankenhäuser die Ärzte überlasten, und sie könnten langfristig finanzielle Verluste erleiden. Junge Ärzte reihen sich an 55.000 junge Ärzte in England 37.700 stimmten über Arbeitskampfmaßnahmen ab 3,1 Mrd. £ ausgegeben für die Bezahlung von jungen Ärzten Derzeit 11 % Erhöhung der Grundvergütung angeboten 25 % Kürzung der Wochenstunden, die eine Prämie für unsoziale Stundenzahlungen nach sich ziehen Quelle: Gesundheitsministerium und BMA Science Fotobibliothek Nach Bekanntgabe des Abstimmungsergebnisses sagte BMA-Führer Dr. Mark Porter: „Wir bedauern die unvermeidliche Störung, die dies verursachen wird, aber es ist das unnachgiebige Beharren der Regierung darauf, einen Vertrag durchzusetzen, der für Patienten in Zukunft unsicher und unfair ist Ärzte jetzt und in Zukunft, das hat uns an diesen Punkt gebracht. Unsere Botschaft an ihn ist, dass die jungen Ärzte heute ihre Meinung klar zum Ausdruck gebracht haben, dass es aber immer noch möglich ist, wieder an den Verhandlungstisch zu kommen, um einen Vertrag zu liefern, der für Patienten sicher ist, die notwendigen vertraglichen Garantien enthält, um eine Überarbeitung der jungen Ärzte zu verhindern erkennt Abend- und Wochenendarbeit richtig an. In der Zwischenzeit hat die Schattengesundheitsministerin der Labour Party, Heidi Alexander, an den Premierminister geschrieben, um ihn zu bitten, einzugreifen, und sagte, der Berufsstand habe das Vertrauen in Herrn Hunt verloren. Sie will auch ein unabhängiges Schiedsverfahren sehen. In dem von der BBC eingesehenen Brief heißt es: Da der NHS vor dem schwierigsten Winter der jüngsten Vergangenheit steht und sich jetzt die Aussicht auf Arbeitskampfmaßnahmen abzeichnet, müssen dringend Schritte unternommen werden, um diesen Streit beizulegen. Der Grafiker Roger Goss von der Kampagnengruppe Patient Concern kritisierte die Art und Weise, wie beide Seiten den Streit gehandhabt hatten, sagte aber, dass die Ärzte nicht streiken sollten. Dies ist die schlimmste Nachricht für Patienten in der Geschichte des NHS. Was ist aus dem Versprechen geworden, dass die Interessen der Patienten an erster Stelle stehen und wir die Patienten an die erste Stelle setzen? Jeder ehrbare Arzt mit echter Berufung, der sich das hohe Ansehen bewahren will, das die Ärzteschaft derzeit genießt, wird sich weigern, Leid zu verursachen, das mit einem umfassenden Arbeitsniederlegung verbunden ist. Schottland und Wales haben erklärt, dass sie die Vertragsänderungen nicht einführen wollen, während Nordirland noch keine Entscheidung treffen muss.

9289000c	Mehr Briten als je zuvor sind erwerbstätig, trotz Vorhersagen über enorme Arbeitsplatzverluste im Falle einer Abstimmung für den Brexit. Offizielle Zahlen, die gestern veröffentlicht wurden, zeigten, dass die Beschäftigung auf einem Rekordhoch liegt, mit mehr als 2.000 Menschen, die jeden Tag Arbeit finden. Die Belegschaft ist auf 32,34 Millionen angewachsen – der höchste Stand seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen im Jahr 1971, so das Office for National Statistics. Die Gesamtzahl ist seit dem Referendum im Juni 2016 um 609.000 gestiegen. Die gestern veröffentlichten offiziellen Zahlen zeigten, dass die Beschäftigung auf einem Rekordhoch liegt, mit mehr als 2.000 Menschen, die jeden Tag eine Arbeit finden. Vor der Abstimmung behauptete George Osborne, dass innerhalb von zwei Jahren bis zu 820.000 Arbeitsplätze verloren gehen könnten, wenn Großbritannien sich für einen Austritt entscheiden würde. „Diese Zahlen zeigen nur, wie lächerlich und diskreditiert Project Fear ist“, sagte der pro-Brexit-Tory-Abgeordnete Andrew Bridgen. „Großbritannien hat nichts zu befürchten, die Kontrolle über sein Geld, seine Grenzen und seine Gesetze zurückzuerobern.“ Sir Bill Cash, ein ebenfalls konservativer Abgeordneter, sagte, die Zahlen zeigten, dass der Brexit „eine große Chance“ sei, die von eingefleischten Remainern aufs Spiel gesetzt werde . Das ONS sagte auch, dass die Zahl der in Großbritannien arbeitenden EU-Bürger seit dem Referendum gestiegen sei. Fast 2,37 Millionen hatten im März einen Arbeitsplatz – 155.000 mehr als Anfang 2016. Und die Zahl der Arbeitnehmer von außerhalb der EU ist in den letzten zwei Jahren um 235.000 gestiegen. Der gestrige Bericht des ONS weckte Hoffnungen, dass die wirtschaftliche Verlangsamung zu Beginn dieses Jahres nur vorübergehend sein würde. Die Wirtschaft wuchs im ersten Quartal nur um 0,1 Prozent, während der Output pro Stunde – ein Schlüsselmaß für die Produktivität – um 0,5 Prozent zurückging. Fast 2,37 Millionen hatten im März einen Arbeitsplatz – 155.000 mehr als Anfang 2016. Und die Zahl der Beschäftigten außerhalb der EU ist in den letzten zwei Jahren um 235.000 gestiegen. Aber Bundeskanzler Philip Hammond sagte: „Wir können stolz auf unsere Bilanz bei den Arbeitsplätzen sein. Die Arbeitslosenquote ist auf dem niedrigsten Stand seit über 40 Jahren.“ John Longworth, der frühere Leiter der britischen Handelskammer, sagte: „Wieder einmal wurde Project Fear von den herausragenden Beschäftigungszahlen geschlagen. „Gleichzeitig sehen wir, dass sich die deutsche Wirtschaft verlangsamt hat und die Arbeitslosigkeit in vielen EU-Ländern nach wie vor unannehmbar hoch ist.“ Seit der Regierungsübernahme der Tories im Jahr 2010 sind 3,2 Millionen Menschen zusätzlich erwerbstätig geworden zwischen 16 und 64 sind jetzt erwerbstätig, der höchste Anteil seit 1991. Die Arbeitslosenquote ist auf ein 43-Jahres-Tief von 4,2 Prozent gesunken – verglichen mit 8,5 Prozent in der Eurozone. Die Arbeitslosigkeit ist auf ein 43-Jahres-Tief von 4,2 Prozent gesunken – verglichen mit 8,5 Prozent in der Eurozone. Die Gesamtzahl fiel in den ersten drei Monaten des Jahres um 46.000 auf 1,42 Millionen – 116.000 weniger als ein Jahr zuvor. In den ersten drei Monaten des Jahres fanden täglich durchschnittlich 2.189 Stellensuchende Arbeit. John Hawksworth, Chefökonom bei PricewaterhouseCoopers, sagte: „Die große britische Maschine zur Schaffung von Arbeitsplätzen ist im ersten Quartal 2018 wieder in Gang gekommen. „All diese guten Nachrichten stehen in deutlichem Kontrast zu dem gedämpften BIP-Wachstum von nur 0,1 Prozent. Diese Schätzung könnte später nach oben revidiert werden. Aber das Produktivitätswachstum wurde nach ein paar Quartalen, als es sich zu beleben schien, wieder negativ. Dies könnte die Tatsache widerspiegeln, dass der Produktionsrückgang aufgrund der kalten Witterung im ersten Quartal nicht zu Arbeitsplatzverlusten geführt hat, da er als rein vorübergehender Rückschlag angesehen wurde.“ Torsten Bell, Direktor der Resolution Foundation, sagte der Post- Der Krisenjobboom in Großbritannien war ein großer Erfolg angesichts der anhaltenden Befürchtungen über die Bedrohung von Arbeitsplätzen durch Technologie und Maschinen. Deutschlands Wachstum geht zurück Die Wirtschaft der Eurozone hat sich zu Beginn des Jahres stark verlangsamt, als Deutschland und Frankreich ins Stolpern gerieten, wie offizielle Zahlen gestern zeigten. Die Produktion im Einheitswährungsblock stieg im ersten Quartal des Jahres um 0,4 Prozent, nachdem sie in den vorangegangenen drei Monaten um 0,7 Prozent gestiegen war. Gebremst wurde die Region von Deutschland und Frankreich – den Maschinenräumen der Eurozone. Das Wachstum in Deutschland verlangsamte sich im ersten Quartal von 0,6 Prozent auf 0,3 Prozent. Gleichzeitig sank das Expansionstempo in Frankreich von 0,7 Prozent auf 0,3 Prozent. Die Zahlen des offiziellen Statistikamts Eurostat schürten Befürchtungen, dass der Erholung in der Eurozone nach einer soliden Leistung im Jahr 2017 die Puste ausgeht. Und obwohl die Arbeitslosigkeit in Großbritannien auf ein 43-Jahres-Tief von 4,2 Prozent gefallen ist, bleibt es in der Eurozone mit 8,5 Prozent hartnäckig hoch. Peter Vanden Houte, Chefökonom der Bankengruppe ING, sagte: „Das schwächere erste Quartal könnte die neue Normalität sein.“ Die Arbeitslosenquote in Frankreich liegt bei 8,8 Prozent, in Italien bei 11 Prozent und in Spanien bei 16,1 Prozent. Der Durchschnitt in der fortgeschrittenen Welt liegt bei 5,4 Prozent. Anzeige Esther McVey, die Arbeits- und Rentenministerin, sagte: „Seit 2010 haben wir gesehen, dass 3,2 Millionen Menschen mehr in ganz Großbritannien eine Arbeit aufgenommen haben. „Die Jugendarbeitslosigkeit ist um über 40 Prozent zurückgegangen und die Arbeitslosenquote auf den niedrigsten Stand seit 1975. Die heutigen Zahlen untermauern einmal mehr diese Trendwende mit einer neuen Rekordbeschäftigungsquote von 75,6 Prozent und durchschnittlich über 1.000 Personen pro Tag , seit 2010, immer einen Job. „Da die Löhne schneller wachsen als die Inflation und die persönlichen Steuerfreibeträge steigen, bringen nicht nur mehr Menschen ein Gehaltspaket nach Hause, sondern sie behalten mehr von ihrem hart verdienten Geld für sich und ihre Familien.“ Die Bank of England glaubt an das offizielle Wachstum Zahl von nur 0,1 Prozent im ersten Quartal wird im Laufe der Zeit auf 0,3 Prozent revidiert. Howard Archer, Chef-Wirtschaftsberater des Ernst & Young Item Club, sagte: „Die Arbeitsmarktzahlen deuten darauf hin, dass die Wirtschaft möglicherweise nicht so schwach ist, wie einige der jüngsten Daten vermuten lassen. Es könnte Hoffnungen schüren, dass sich die Wirtschaft erholen kann, nachdem sich das BIP-Wachstum im ersten Quartal verlangsamt hat.“ Das ONS sagte auch, dass die Löhne am schnellsten seit fast drei Jahren gestiegen seien, da die Unternehmen mehr Personal eingestellt hätten. Der Durchschnittslohn stieg im Jahr bis März um 3 Prozent auf einen Rekordwert von 484 £ pro Woche. Es war der stärkste Anstieg seit 2015 und noch vor der Inflation von 2,5 Prozent.

87ad7cb5	Der Verbleib in der EU ist für das Vereinigte Königreich die riskantere Option, da es die steigende Migration nicht kontrollieren kann, warnte Boris Johnson. Der ehemalige Bürgermeister von London sagte, das Bevölkerungswachstum sei die größte wirtschaftliche Veränderung im Vereinigten Königreich seit einem Jahrhundert. Sein Mitkämpfer für den Austritt, Michael Gove, sagte, die EU untergrabe die Sicherheit unserer Bevölkerung. David Cameron beschuldigte die Leave-Kampagne, mit Fantasiepolitik hausieren zu wollen. Verbleibende Aktivisten wiesen auch die Behauptung von Herrn Johnson zurück, dass Großbritannien nicht in der Lage sein würde, zusätzlichen Zahlungsforderungen aus Brüssel zu widerstehen, als Unsinn, da die Staats- und Regierungschefs der EU bereits zugestimmt hatten, dass Großbritannien nicht für zukünftige Rettungspakete zahlen würde. Großbritannien habe auch ein Veto gegen künftige Budgeterhöhungen, fügten sie hinzu. Verfolgen Sie die neuesten Updates mit dem Live-Reality-Check des BBC EU-Referendums: Wird das Vereinigte Königreich für zukünftige Euro-Rettungspakete zahlen?

Herr Johnson sagte, das Bevölkerungswachstum sei teilweise auf die Migration zurückzuführen, die durch die Krise in der Eurozone verursacht wurde, und forderte die verbleibende Seite auf, einen Plan für den Druck zu formulieren, den sie auf den Wohnungsbau und den NHS ausübe. Die Labour-Abgeordnete und Remain-Aktivistin Harriet Harman sagte, diese seien in der Verantwortung der Regierung, nicht der EU. Herr Johnson sagte auch, dass seine Seite alle demokratischen Punkte gewinne und dass die Argumente von Remain moralisch und praktisch und völlig falsch seien. line EU-Referendum Reality Check Zahlt Großbritannien für künftige Euro-Rettungspakete?

Lesen Sie mehr aus der Reality-Check-Linie Die Vorteile des Binnenmarkts würden stark überbewertet, behauptete Herr Johnson, und sagte, Großbritannien könne nicht von den Kosten für die Rettung der Schwächen der Eurozone und anderen Kostensteigerungen isoliert werden. Als er anschließend Fragen stellte, wies er die Idee zurück, dass die Neuverhandlung von David Cameron den Schutz Großbritanniens vor der Zahlung künftiger Rettungspakete gesichert habe. Der Deal habe derzeit keine Rechtsgrundlage und könne leicht außer Kraft gesetzt werden, sagte er. Herr Gove, der Justizminister, sagte, die grenzenlose Schengen-Zone der EU – der das Vereinigte Königreich nicht angehört – unterstützt aktiv Terroristen. Er sagte auch, die Politik der Einheitswährung habe zum Aufstieg extremistischer Parteien geführt. line Analyse von Laura Künssberg, politische Redakteurin der BBC Für Wähler, die gerade erst auf die EU-Referendumsdebatte einschalten, werfen sie vielleicht einen Blick und schalten wieder aus. Was sie heute Morgen sehen könnten – eine Seite beschuldigt die andere, ein Haufen Lügner zu sein, denen Sie nicht vertrauen würden, Ihre Katze zu füttern, die andere Seite behauptet, die anderen seien verbitterte Ehemalige und eine Menge höhnischer Patrizier, die Ihnen sagen, dass sie es wissen Beste. Politische Debatten, die in manchen Momenten nicht viel raffinierter sind als ein Haufen Schulkinder, die sich auf dem Schulhof mit brennenden Hosen anbrüllen. Angesichts dessen, dass dies eine der größten Entscheidungen ist, die wir als Land seit Generationen getroffen haben – ich weiß, das klingt banal, aber es ist wahr –, ist es nicht gerade erbaulich anzusehen, und wie es in den wilderen Tagen des schottischen Referendums geschah, ist diese Kampagne ein Versuch in einer Welt, in der die Wahrheit kein sicherer Anker ist. Lesen Sie mehr von Laura Line Vote Leave sagt, dass neue Zahlen darauf hindeuten, dass Großbritannien kurz nach dem Referendum eine zusätzliche Rechnung in Höhe von 2,4 Mrd. £ aufgrund eines Rückstands unbezahlter Rechnungen und einer Verzögerung bei der Überprüfung des EU-Haushalts erhalten könnte. Aber es wurde vom Institute for Fiscal Studies gerügt, das reagierte, nachdem Herr Gove die Denkfabrik während einer Live-Fragerunde auf Sky News zitiert hatte. Am Freitagabend sagte Herr Gove: Es gibt Milliarden von Pfund, die wir jedes Jahr an die Europäische Union schicken, und der IFS hat darauf hingewiesen, dass wir es für den NHS ausgeben könnten, wenn wir dieses Geld zurücknehmen würden Mehrwertsteuer auf Kraftstoff senken. Der IFS gab eine Erklärung heraus, in der er sagte, dass der Nettobeitrag des Vereinigten Königreichs zur EU selbst durch einen kleinen Schaden für die öffentlichen Finanzen, der durch den Austritt verursacht würde, in den Schatten gestellt würde. Es fügte hinzu: „Deshalb kommen wir zu dem Schluss, dass ein Austritt aus der EU nicht, wie Michael Gove behauptet, mehr Geld für den NHS übrig lassen würde. Vielmehr würden wir weniger für öffentliche Dienstleistungen ausgeben, mehr Steuern zahlen oder mehr Kredite aufnehmen. Bei einer separaten Veranstaltung am Montag, die Britain Stronger in Europe als beispiellose Demonstration parteiübergreifender Unterstützung bezeichnete, sagten Herr Cameron, Frau Harman, der Vorsitzende der Lib Dem, Tim Farron, und die Vorsitzende der Grünen, Natalie Bennett, dass sie sich weigerten, einen Wirtschaftsplan für den Brexit vorzulegen rücksichtslos und undemokratisch. Sie sagten: Es ist an der Zeit, dass die Leave-Kampagne ihren Wirtschaftsplan für Großbritannien außerhalb Europas skizziert. Sie betrügen das britische Volk mit einem wirtschaftlichen Betrug, und wir kündigen die Zeit dafür an. Die britische Öffentlichkeit verdient etwas Besseres, als zum Würfeln aufgefordert zu werden. Sie enthüllten auch ein Dossier über die oft widersprüchlichen Aussagen der Leave-Kampagne zur Wirtschaft und behaupteten, sie habe 23 Positionen zur Alternative zum Binnenmarkt vertreten. Vote Leave-Geschäftsführer Matthew Elliott beschrieb die Behauptungen als verzweifeltes Zeug aus einer zunehmend verzweifelten Kampagne. Wir haben eine Reihe von Versprechen abgegeben, wie das Leben besser wird, wenn wir die Kontrolle zurückerlangen. Wir wollen mehr in den NHS investieren, 300.000 Arbeitsplätze durch neue Handelsabkommen schaffen, Energierechnungen für Familien senken und ein neues punktebasiertes Einwanderungssystem im australischen Stil einführen, sagte er. Unterdessen unterstützten Gewerkschaftsführer – darunter die Generalsekretäre von Unite, Unison und GMB – in einem Brief an den Guardian die Kampagne für den Verbleib in der EU. Sie warnten, dass die konservative Regierung unsere Rechte wegverhandeln würde, wenn die Wähler den Brexit unterstützen würden. Arbeitnehmerrechte – darunter Mutterschafts- und Vaterschaftsrechte, Gleichbehandlung von Arbeitnehmern und das Recht auf bezahlten Urlaub – seien mit europäischen Partnern ausgehandelt worden, sagten sie. Wenn Großbritannien die EU verlässt, besteht kein Zweifel, dass dieser Schutz stark bedroht wäre, fügte die Gewerkschaft hinzu.	Boris Johnson warnt vor „Risiken“ der EU-Migration	false

Zunächst einmal gibt es den potenziellen Verlust so vieler talentierter NHS-Mitarbeiter aus der EU. Das könnte eine Personalkrise im NHS auslösen. Wo um alles in der Welt wäre unser NHS ohne all die Mitarbeiter, die sich so dafür einsetzen: Die Ärzte, Krankenschwestern und Hilfskräfte? Die Personalliste des NHS umfasst 50.000 Mitarbeiter aus dem Europäischen Wirtschaftsraum – darunter 9.000 Ärzte, 18.000 Krankenschwestern und Hebammen sowie über 2.000 andere Angehörige der Gesundheitsberufe. Dies sind Menschen, die entscheidende Qualifikationslücken schließen und ihr unglaubliches Wissen und ihre Erfahrung einsetzen, um britischen Leben zu retten. Natürlich sollte die Regierung mehr in Ausbildungsmöglichkeiten für Einheimische investieren. Die Kürzungen der NHS-Stipendien unserer Regierung waren das Schlimmste, was bei der Bewältigung einer wachsenden Ausbildungskrise möglich war. Aber Migranten verstopfen den NHS nicht – sie stützen ihn. Ja, unser NHS ist am Bruchpunkt. Die Mitarbeiter sind überarbeitet und die Dienstleistungen sind gedehnt. Aber das liegt nicht an anständigen, fleißigen Migranten, die ihren Weg bezahlen. Migranten sind oft jüngere Menschen, die seltener Gesundheitsleistungen benötigen als der durchschnittliche britische Bürger, aber dennoch britische Steuern zahlen, um sie zu unterstützen. Der NHS befindet sich in einer Personalkrise, weil die Regierung einen weiteren fünfjährigen Ausgabenstopp verhängt hat. Die Gehaltsobergrenze der Tories hat zu Rekrutierungs- und Bindungsproblemen im gesamten Dienst geführt, was bedeutet, dass immer mehr Steuergelder für Agenturen und Unternehmensberater verschwendet werden, was unsere starke Abhängigkeit von EU-Gesundheitspersonal erhöht. Überall im NHS sind die Mitarbeiter demoralisiert – sie haben es satt, zu wenig Mittel zu haben, um den Patienten zu helfen, die ihnen so sehr am Herzen liegen, zu viele Umstrukturierungen von oben nach unten und nicht genug ministeriellen Respekt. Und haben es satt, dass ihr Engagement als selbstverständlich hingenommen wird. Die Arbeitszeitrichtlinie der EU bedeutet, dass wir Regeln haben, die das Wohlbefinden der Mitarbeiter schützen und die Patientensicherheit nicht unnötig gefährden. Wir haben bereits engagiertes Gesundheitspersonal, das viele Überstunden macht, aber viele Brexit-Führungskräfte wollen ihr Recht, übermäßige Arbeitszeiten abzulehnen, aufheben und sie dazu drängen, noch länger zu arbeiten. Und natürlich hängt die Finanzierung des NHS davon ab, dass es der britischen Wirtschaft gut geht. So ziemlich jeder ist sich einig, dass der Austritt aus der EU die Wirtschaft treffen wird, selbst die Brexit-Befürworter geben zu, dass es kurzfristig weh tun würde, und das wird unsere Krise noch tiefer in Schwierigkeiten bringen. Basierend auf der IFS-Analyse wird die öffentliche Hand wahrscheinlich jedes Jahr genug Geld verlieren, wenn wir die EU verlassen, um den gesamten NHS England für 3 Monate zu finanzieren. Natürlich würden nicht alle Kürzungen der öffentlichen Ausgaben auf den NHS fallen. Aber bis zum Ende des Jahrzehnts könnten es immer noch bis zu 10 Milliarden Pfund pro Jahr sein. Das entspricht jedem Krankenhaus-Trust in England, der 1.000 Krankenschwestern und 155 Ärzte streicht. Aber was mich an der Diskussion über den NHS in dieser Referendumskampagne stört, ist die Heuchelei. Denn wann haben sich die führenden Köpfe des Brexit jemals um den NHS gekümmert? Glaubt irgendjemand wirklich, dass Boris Johnson sich um den NHS kümmert? Das ist derselbe Boris Johnson, der aktenkundig sagt, dass er nicht an einen kostenlosen NHS glaubt; und dass die Leute, wenn sie für Dienstleistungen bezahlen würden, diese mehr wertschätzen würden. Oder Michael Gove, der ein Buch mitverfasst hat, in dem es heißt, der NHS sei „im 21. Jahrhundert nicht mehr relevant“? Oder Iain Duncan Smith, der gesagt hat, er würde ein Sozialversicherungssystem bevorzugen? Oder gar Nigel Farage, der glaubt, dass innerhalb der nächsten zehn Jahre der NHS durch eine private Krankenversicherung ersetzt werden sollte? Ich glaube nicht, dass sie den NHS, wie wir ihn kennen und lieben, unterstützen, genauso wenig wie ich glaube, dass sie das EU/US-TTIP-Handelsabkommen ablehnen. Wenn wir aus der EU herauskämen, würden uns diese Männer wie ein Schuss in ihre eigenen geheimen Handelsabkommen unterzeichnen. Wir wüssten nicht einmal von den Deals; geschweige denn die Chance haben, sie zu ändern. Aber die vielleicht beschämendste Lüge der Leave-Kampagne ist die Behauptung, dass ein Austritt aus der EU mehr Geld für den NHS bedeuten würde. Ehrlich gesagt war ich verblüfft, als ich zum ersten Mal den Schlachtbus-Slogan der Leave-Kampagne sah. Wie die Tory-Abgeordnete und ehemalige GP Sarah Wollaston letzte Woche sagte, als sie von der Aufenthaltserlaubnis abwanderte: „Es ist einfach nicht wahr“. Selbst wenn wir darauf vertrauten, dass sie mit dem Geld das Richtige tun, passen die Summen einfach nicht zusammen. Sie wurden dafür wiederholt vom britischen Statistikwächter kritisiert. Die Austrittskampagne sagt gerne, wir Reste seien negativ. Um ehrlich zu sein, wenn man mit einer Veränderung konfrontiert wird, die solchen Schaden anrichten könnte, ist es schwer, es nicht zu sein. Aber es gibt auch positive Gründe, für Remain für unseren NHS zu stimmen. In der EU zu sein, trägt dazu bei, unseren NHS zu verbessern. Es bedeutet einen gemeinsamen Satz von Berufsstandards in der gesamten EU. Und wenn Sie beruflich oder im Urlaub sind, haben britische Staatsbürger das Recht auf kostenlose Gesundheitsversorgung in anderen Mitgliedsstaaten. Es bedeutet auch erhebliche Mittel für die Forschung und Entwicklung im Bereich Gesundheit. Allein im vergangenen Jahr erhielt das Vereinigte Königreich 232 Millionen Pfund an EU-Geldern – übrigens der größte Anteil an Finanzmitteln, den ein EU-Mitgliedstaat erhalten hat. Dazu gehörten lebenswichtige Gelder für die Forschung im Kinderkrankenhaus Great Ormond Street, im Universitätskrankenhaus Birmingham und im Blut- und Transplantationsdienst des NHS. Es hält den NHS weltweit an der Spitze des Gesundheitswesens. Also haben wir eine Wahl zu treffen. Um unseren NHS aufzubauen – oder es zu riskieren. Um unseren NHS zu unterstützen – oder ihn zu privatisieren. Und um die Mitarbeiter des NHS zu feiern und zu schätzen – oder sie zu dämonisieren und zu spalten. Ein Votum für den Austritt ist nicht nur ein großes Spiel mit Jobs, Löhnen und Rechten, es ist auch ein großes Spiel mit unserem NHS. Der NHS wurde von und für arbeitende Menschen gebaut. Es geht um Solidarität, Kollaboration und Zusammenarbeit. Und es ist zu speziell, zu kostbar, um es den privatisierenden Tories und der UKIP anzuvertrauen, die den Brexit als Weg zu einem deregulierten Vereinigten Königreich mit niedrigen Steuern und Dienstleistungen vorantreiben. Der NHS muss geschützt werden, wenn er sich um unsere Kinder und Enkelkinder kümmern kann. Ich werde weiterhin dafür stimmen.	Unser NHS ist sicherer in Europa: #NHSsaferIN	other
2cf85ad9	Theresa May stellte bezahlbaren Wohnraum in den Mittelpunkt ihres Angebots an die Wähler, als sie Premierministerin wurde. Das Ziel der Regierung sind eine Million neue Wohnungen bis 2020; Das Argument ist, dass mehr Angebot die Preise senkt. Aber der Chef von Berkeley Homes, einem der größten Wohnungsbauunternehmen Großbritanniens, sagt, das Ziel könnte verfehlt werden. Um die derzeitige Neubaurate auf über 170.000 pro Jahr zu steigern, seien radikale Veränderungen erforderlich, sagt Rob Perrins. Als ich ihn fragte, ob das Ziel getroffen würde, war seine Antwort nachdrücklich. Die Antwort ist nein, und überraschenderweise ist die Antwort nicht auf Planung zurückzuführen, sagte er. In den letzten Jahren gab es einige sehr gute Reformen in der Planung. [Allerdings] gibt es drei Gründe, warum sie das Ziel nicht treffen werden. Erstens gibt es nicht genug Land, das für die Entwicklung bereit ist. Zweitens hat das Vereinigte Königreich die höchste Grundsteuer der Welt. Und es wirkt abschreckend darauf, zu bauen und [für die Menschen] umzuziehen. Und drittens glaube ich nicht, dass es eines der drei wichtigsten politischen Themen ist. Und für die unter 30-Jährigen gebe es nichts Wichtigeres, als die Wohnungskrise zu lösen, fügte Herr Perrins hinzu. Er sagte, die Regierung sollte das Problem genauso ernst nehmen wie die Finanzierung des Nationalen Gesundheitsdienstes. Ich habe Herrn Perrins auf dem Kidbrooke-Anwesen im Südosten Londons interviewt, wo Berkeley Homes 4.500 neue Wohnungen baut – 1.500 davon werden billigere, bezahlbare Wohnungen sein. Das Kidbrooke-Anwesen ist Großbritanniens Immobilienkrise im Mikrokosmos. In den 1960er Jahren hieß das Gebiet Ferrier Estate, ein deprimierender Dschungel aus Betonfertigteilen, der verfallen war. In den 1990er Jahren begann der Gemeinderat von Greenwich – den Herr Perrins als einen der besten bezeichnet, wenn es um die Unterstützung des Wohnungsbaus geht – mit der Planung, das Gelände neu zu entwickeln. Es dauerte 10 Jahre, bis ein Entwicklungsvertrag für das Gebiet erzielt wurde, der 2007 unterzeichnet wurde Einrichtungen - wie eine neue Schule und ein Gesundheitszentrum - die bereitgestellt werden. Alle können sehr notwendig sein, aber alle verlangsamen das System. Die endgültigen Häuser werden erst 2030 fertiggestellt – mehr als 30 Jahre, nachdem der Rat das Gebiet erstmals für eine Sanierung vorgesehen hatte. Langsamer Fortschritt Der Bau von Häusern in Großbritannien ist ein Eiszeitgeschäft. Das eigentliche Problem besteht meiner Ansicht nach darin, Land für die Entwicklung vorzubereiten, sagte Herr Perrins. Es geht auch um Infrastruktur. Es geht um Strom. Es geht um Erdgas. Es geht um angrenzende Grundstücksgenehmigungen. Es geht um all die Infrastrukturprobleme rund um die Bereitstellung von Land, und davon gibt es eine Menge. Es gibt natürlich viele andere Gründe, die für den chronischen Mangel an neuen Wohnungen in Großbritannien angeführt werden. Einer davon ist, dass Hausbauer das Angebot absichtlich einschränken, um die Preise – und ihre Gewinne – hoch zu halten. Die Regierung erwägt finanzielle Sanktionen für Bauherren, die Land nicht schnell genug erschließen. Dieser Politikvorschlag könnte in einem Wohnungsweißbuch konkretisiert werden, das noch vor Weihnachten veröffentlicht werden soll. Herr Perrins wies diese Kritik an Hausbauern zurück und sagte, dass Unternehmen wie seines bereit seien, zu bauen. Wir gehen ein großes Risiko ein, Websites wie diese [Kidbrooke] für die Entwicklung bereit zu machen, sagte er. Es ist enorm kompliziert und wir gehen diese Risiken über mehrere Jahre ein. Es erfordert auch eine Menge Kapital. Standorte wie diese erfordern über 200 Millionen Pfund Kapital, um sie voranzubringen, betonte er. „Raise our game“ Die Renditen müssen gut sein, um die Aktionäre – darunter viele Pensionskassen – zufrieden zu stellen. Sie dürfen keine Richtlinien einführen, die Sie davon abhalten, den Wohnungsbau voranzubringen, sagte Herr Perrins über alle Maßnahmen der Regierung zur Verhängung von Geldstrafen für Unternehmen, die nicht schnell genug neue Häuser bauen. Die Regierung besitzt 40 % des Landes im Vereinigten Königreich; Sie haben genug eigenes Land, um die Wohnungsnot zu lösen, fügte er hinzu. Bricksimage copyrightPA Da Number 10 und das Finanzministerium beide sagen, dass der Wohnungsneubau Priorität hat, wird die für die Umsetzung der Wohnungspolitik zuständige Regierungsabteilung – Gemeinden und Kommunalverwaltungen – unter die Lupe genommen. Der Wohnungsbauminister Gavin Barwell sagte mir, er stimme nicht zu, dass das Ziel von einer Million neuer Wohnungen bis 2020 definitiv verfehlt werde. Ich akzeptiere auf jeden Fall, dass wir es beim derzeitigen Kurs nicht schaffen werden, also müssen wir unser Spiel erhöhen, sagte er. Aber ich denke, wenn Sie sowohl in unsere eigene Vergangenheit als auch auf einige unserer nahen Nachbarn schauen, ist es möglich, die Anzahl von Häusern zu bauen, die wir in diesem Land brauchen, und es ist meine Aufgabe, mit meinem Chef Sajid Javid zusammenzuarbeiten [the Gemeinde- und Kommunalverwaltungssekretär], um sicherzustellen, dass wir dies tun, fügte der Minister hinzu. Wie? ist die Frage, die sich Regierungen seit Jahrzehnten stellen, seit den 1960er und 1970er Jahren, als der Wohnungsbau eine öffentliche und private Angelegenheit war und 100.000 Sozialwohnungen pro Jahr zu der Zahl hinzukamen, die von privaten Entwicklern gebaut wurde. Ich denke, wenn es eine einfache Antwort auf diese Frage gäbe, hätte jemand das Problem bereits gelöst, sagte Herr Barwell. Ich denke, es gibt eine Kombination von Dingen. In einigen Teilen des Landes geben wir nicht genügend Land in das System frei. Dann bekommen die Leute oft eine Baugenehmigung, aber es dauert zu lange, daraus ein Zuhause zu machen – man kann nicht in einer Baugenehmigung leben. Wir sind zu langsam, um Spaten in den Boden zu stecken, wenn wir eine Baugenehmigung haben. Ich denke, wir sind zu abhängig von einer kleinen Anzahl großer Hausbauer, also müssen wir das Spektrum der Leute, die bauen, erweitern. Und dann müssen wir sicherstellen, dass wir genug Leute im Land haben, die die Fähigkeiten haben, in der Industrie zu arbeiten, sagte er. Frau May hat in ihrer kurzen Zeit als Premierministerin darauf geachtet, zu vielen Zielen auszuweichen. Aber sie weiß, dass die eine Million neue Häuser bis 2020 eines sein werden, für das die Wähler sie zur Rechenschaft ziehen können und werden. Erwarten Sie eine Flut von Regierungsaktivitäten – zur Vereinfachung der Planungsregeln und zur Förderung des Aufbaus lokaler Behörden – bis Ende des Jahres.	PM wird das Ziel von einer Million neuer Wohnungen nicht erreichen	false
d56e6e70	Die Zahl der Krankenhausbetten für Menschen mit akuten psychischen Erkrankungen, bei denen ein beratender Psychiater zur Überwachung der Behandlung zur Verfügung steht, ist seit 2009 um fast 30 % gesunken, trotz wiederholter Behauptungen von Ministern, dass die Verbesserung der Versorgung psychisch Kranker jetzt höchste Priorität hat. Neue offizielle Zahlen zeigen, dass die Zahl der Betten für Menschen mit einigen der schwersten Erkrankungen – darunter Psychosen, schwere Depressionen mit Suizidgefühlen und Essstörungen – von 26.448 im Jahr 2009 auf 18.082 im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres gesunken ist. In den gleichen neun Jahren zeigen die Daten auch einen deutlichen Rückgang der Zahl der im NHS tätigen Psychiatriekrankenschwestern – von 46.155 auf 39.358 – und der Zahl der Ärzte in Facharztausbildung für Psychiatrie, von 3.187 im Jahr 2009 auf 2.588 im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres. Letzte Nacht sagte der Abgeordnete Dr. Dan Poulter, ein ehemaliger Tory-Gesundheitsminister, der jetzt in Teilzeit als NHS-Arzt in psychiatrischen Diensten praktiziert, es sei klar, dass die Rhetorik der Regierung, psychische Gesundheit mit körperlicher Gesundheit „gleichwertig zu schätzen“, sei nicht durch Aktion abgestimmt. Poulter, der die neuen Daten durch parlamentarische Antworten erhielt, sagte, dass die psychische Gesundheit immer noch ein „Aschenputtel-Dienst“ sei, wobei die psychische Gesundheit von Kindern und Jugendlichen am weitesten hinter akzeptablen Standards zurückbleibe. Der Dienst, in dem er arbeitet, sei nicht nur unzureichend, sondern auch unsicher für die Patienten, behauptete er. „Die Realität vor Ort ist, dass immer weniger Betten für die Patienten zur Verfügung stehen, die sie brauchen. Das bedeutet, dass Menschen, die sehr krank sind, zum Beispiel mit Psychosen oder Depressionen mit Suizidgedanken, keinen Zugang zu einer zeitnahen stationären Versorgung haben. Essstörungen sind ein weiterer Dienst, bei dem es oft zu langen Wartezeiten für Patienten kommt, die dringend Betten für eine stationäre Behandlung benötigen. Das ist für die Patienten nicht ungefährlich. „Fachkräfte für psychische Gesundheit arbeiten unglaublich hart, aber wir sind unterbesetzt. Trotz der Notwendigkeit, die Dienste zu erweitern, um den Bedürfnissen der Patienten gerecht zu werden, und Menschen mit psychischen Erkrankungen in der Gemeinde mehr Unterstützung zu bieten, stehen einfach nicht die Ressourcen dafür zur Verfügung.“ Der Mangel an Betten führt dazu, dass die Schwächsten im ganzen Land abgeschoben werden oder sogar im Gefängnis sitzen und auf die Pflege warten, die sie brauchen. Janet Davies Bettenknappheit ist in einigen Teilen Englands so groß, dass Patienten manchmal Hunderte von Kilometern von zu Hause und sogar nach Schottland geschickt werden, um Zugang zur stationären Versorgung zu erhalten. Die Minister haben zugesagt, die Pflege außerhalb des Wohngebiets bis 2020 abzuschaffen, aber bis zu 700 Menschen im Monat werden immer noch außerhalb ihres Heimatgebiets betreut. Gesundheitsorganisationen und Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen sagten, die Daten seien ein weiterer Beweis dafür, dass die Minister nicht angemessen auf eine wachsende Krise der psychischen Gesundheit reagierten. Janet Davies, Geschäftsführerin des Royal College of Nursing, sagte, die Zahlen zeigten, dass die Versprechen der Politiker, die NHS-Versorgung für Menschen mit psychischen Erkrankungen zu verbessern, nicht eingehalten worden seien. „Trotz aller Rhetorik über die Bedeutung der psychischen Gesundheit zeigen diese Zahlen die schmerzhafte Realität. Tausende von erfahrenen Fachleuten sind verloren gegangen, und dieser Mangel an stationären Betten lässt die Schwächsten im ganzen Land oder sogar in Gefängniszellen rangieren und warten auf die Pflege, die sie dringend benötigen“, sagte Davies. Paul Farmer, Geschäftsführer der Wohltätigkeitsorganisation für psychische Gesundheit Mind und Vorsitzender der Taskforce für psychische Gesundheit des NHS England in den Jahren 2015-16, sagte: „Psychiatrische Dienste wurden oft als weiches Ziel für Kürzungen angesehen, und diese Zahlen sind eine deutliche Erinnerung daran die langfristigen Folgen einer Unterinvestition in das Personal der psychischen Gesundheit.“ Das Gesundheits- und Sozialfürsorgegesetz von 2012 legte fest, dass zwischen körperlicher und geistiger Gesundheit „gleiche Wertschätzung“ bestehen sollte. Aber trotz Versprechen zusätzlicher Mittel waren viele Stiftungen für psychische Gesundheit gezwungen, Betten für akute psychische Gesundheit zu streichen. Viele NHS-Mitarbeiter beschweren sich darüber, dass die Dienstleistungen in der Gemeinde so unzureichend finanziert sind, dass sie nicht verhindern können, dass Patienten mit ernsthaften Problemen im Krankenhaus landen. Im Oktober 2017 betonte die Premierministerin Theresa May, dass die Verbesserung der Behandlung der psychischen Gesundheit eine ihrer obersten Prioritäten sei. „Die Bekämpfung der Ungerechtigkeit psychischer Erkrankungen ist eine meiner absoluten Prioritäten als Premierminister, und ich glaube, dass wir als Gesellschaft durch gemeinsames Ergreifen dieser Schritte unsere Einstellung zu psychischen Erkrankungen verändern und die Art und Weise verbessern können, wie wir uns um alle Menschen mit psychischen Erkrankungen kümmern Probleme“, sagte sie. Aber seitdem ist die Zahl der Akutbetten für psychiatrische Erkrankungen weiter gesunken und befindet sich nun auf dem niedrigsten Stand seit mehr als einem Jahrzehnt. Letzte Woche räumte sie im Unterhaus ein, dass mehr getan werden müsse und dass der Gottesdienst „zu lange vernachlässigt“ worden sei. Der Geschäftsführer von NHS England, Simon Stevens, identifizierte letzte Woche die psychische Gesundheit als eine der fünf Prioritäten, die der Zehnjahresplan des Dienstes angehen muss. Darin wird im November fällig, wie der NHS die zusätzlichen 20 Milliarden Pfund ausgeben wird, die er erhalten hat. Er warnte jedoch davor, dass die Verbesserung der psychischen Gesundheitsversorgung mehr als fünf Jahre dauern könnte – aufgrund von Personalmangel. In seiner ersten Rede als neuer Gesundheits- und Sozialminister am Freitag nannte Matt Hancock die psychische Gesundheit jedoch nicht als eine seiner drei Hauptprioritäten, trotz Theresa Mays starkem persönlichen Interesse an dem Thema und seiner Beschreibung als eines der britischen Gesellschaft „brennendes Unrecht“. Ein Sprecher des Ministeriums für Gesundheit und Soziales sagte: „Psychische Gesundheit ist eine der obersten Prioritäten dieser Regierung, und wir setzen uns dafür ein, dass sich die Dienstleistungen durch Rekordbeträge verbessern, zusätzliche 1 Mrd. GBP zwischen 2017-18 und 2020-2021 und erhebliche Zunahme der Belegschaft, mit 21.000 neuen Stellen, die bis 2021 geschaffen werden sollen.“ Regierungsquellen sagten, es sei anerkannt worden, dass mehr Krankenschwestern benötigt würden, weshalb die Minister eine Aufstockung um mehr als 5.000 zusätzliche Ausbildungsplätze für Krankenschwestern angekündigt hätten, die ab September verfügbar sein würden, einschließlich Ausbildungsplätzen für psychische Gesundheit.

24fd8f3f	Heule, schlage deinen Kopf gegen die Wand, reiße dir die Haare und verzweifle an diesem Land. Wie kann es sein, dass fast die Hälfte der Bevölkerung glaubt, dass die Menschen aufgrund der Pandemie ihren Arbeitsplatz verloren haben, weil sie ihre eigene Leistungsschwäche hatten? Nur 31 % führen es auf Pech zurück. Schauen Sie sich in jeder Stadt und jedem Ort um, um die geschlossenen Geschäfte, geschlossenen Büros, vernagelten Kneipen, Bars und Restaurants zu sehen, die offensichtlichen Zeichen des Massenverlusts von Arbeitsplätzen. Wieder einmal sind die Linken gezwungen, einige düstere Realitäten über die Haltung der britischen Öffentlichkeit zu konfrontieren. Die gründliche Forschung des King’s College London darüber, wie Menschen über Ungleichheit denken, reicht aus, um die politische Hoffnung so gut wie auszulöschen. Es ist schön zu wissen, dass Labour-Anhänger freundlicher sind als ihre Tory-Kollegen, aber trotzdem glauben schockierende 39 % der Labour-Wähler, dass es die eigene Schuld der Menschen ist, dass sie ihren Arbeitsplatz verloren haben, da die Arbeitslosenquote diese Woche 5 % erreichte, und es wird noch schlimmer kommen. Warum schockiert uns das immer wieder, da das britische Volk am häufigsten in konservativen Regierungen gewählt hat, wobei Labour immer wieder niedergeschlagen wurde? Das Brexit-Votum war der schwerste Hammerschlag seit Menschengedenken, gefolgt von Boris Johnsons Triumph. Diese Untersuchung zeigt, dass es außergewöhnlich kluger Überzeugungsarbeit bedarf, um die Öffentlichkeit mit einem ausreichend starken Willen zu begeistern, Ungleichheit deutlich zu reduzieren. „Es gibt keinen weit verbreiteten Appetit auf Veränderung“, schließt der letzte Abschnitt dieses niederschmetternden Berichts. Was für ein Schlag für uns alle, die hoffen, dass diese Krise ein Moment von 1945 sein könnte, dass die massive Intervention des Staates zum Überleben so vieler Menschen den Appetit auf mehr geweckt haben könnte. „Trotz der durch die Pandemie verursachten wirtschaftlichen Schwierigkeiten sollten wir keine weit verbreitete Neubewertung der Argumente für größere staatliche Eingriffe in die Wirtschaft erwarten“, lautet das ernüchternde Fazit. Der Hauptautor, Professor Bobby Duffy, langjähriger Ipsos-Mori-Forscher zu sozialen Einstellungen, erinnerte mich daran, dass sich die Einstellungen zu Rasse, Geschlecht und Sexualität historisch zum Besseren gewendet haben und dass jüngere Menschen erheblich fortschrittlicher sind als diejenigen, die es sind alt. Aber als ich mit ihm sprach, warnte er davor, dass sich die Einstellungen wieder ändern können: „Das heißt nicht, dass es keine Rückfälle geben wird.“ Er warnte in Bezug auf die Rasse, dass feste 13% giftige rassistische Einstellungen haben. Ein Viertel der Menschen denkt, dass es kein Problem wäre, wenn Covid einen Anstieg der ethnischen Ungleichheit verursacht, obwohl 67 % sagen, dass dies der Fall wäre. Die Ungleichheit zwischen den Geschlechtern hat einen geringen Stellenwert, möglicherweise weil sich eine ältere Generation daran erinnert, wie sehr sich das bereits verbessert hat. Hier ist die große politische Kluft, die interessanterweise in Brexit-bezogene Linien fällt: Zwei Drittel der Labour-Verbliebenen glauben, dass die Krise mehr staatliche Intervention rechtfertigt, verglichen mit nur einem von fünf konservativen Austritten. Die Pandemie hat die Ansichten trotz all des Applaus für Pflegekräfte und Schlüsselkräfte kaum verändert. Während 82 % der Labour-Verbliebenen glaubten, Großbritannien sei vor dem Ausbruch des Coronavirus ungleich, wird diese Ansicht von nur 53 % der konservativen Abgänger geteilt. Was soll jetzt dagegen getan werden? Das hängt davon ab, wie die Frage formuliert ist: Verwenden Sie das Wort „Umverteilung“ und die Unterstützung für Maßnahmen beträgt nur 48 %, aber formulieren Sie es als „die Regierung sollte Maßnahmen ergreifen, um die Einkommensunterschiede zu verringern“, und die Unterstützung steigt auf 62 %. Besteuern Sie diejenigen, die sehr reich sind, und Unternehmen, aber nicht sich selbst, so lautet ungefähr die Übersetzung, wie in vielen anderen Umfragen. Die einzige Frage der Benachteiligung, bei der sich die meisten einig sind, ist die Ungleichheit des Platzes. Etwa 61 % stimmen zu, dass Ungleichheiten zwischen mehr und weniger benachteiligten Gebieten am schwerwiegendsten sind. Paul Johnson, Leiter des IFS, für den diese Forschung Teil seines Deaton Review of Inequalities ist, findet dies verblüffend. Er rätselt darüber, ob die Leute Norden und Süden meinen, sagen wir Burnley versus Twickenham, oder meinen sie, so hofft er, überall die Kluft zwischen armen und reichen Bezirken? London zum Beispiel mag unter den City-Bankern einen grotesken Reichtum haben, aber es hat auch die größte Armut, und er sagt, es sei bei weitem am stärksten von der durch die Pandemie verursachten Arbeitslosigkeit betroffen. Durchschnittswerte täuschen trügerisch. „Nehmen Sie die tatsächliche Kluft zwischen Absolventen und Nicht-Absolventen“, sagt Johnson. „Nach Zählung der Wohnkosten hat ein Absolvent in Burnley das gleiche Einkommen wie einer in Twickenham, aber viel mehr Absolventen, die in Twickenham leben, geben ihm einen hohen Durchschnitt.“ Kann diese einfache Tatsache erklärt werden, damit die Menschen erkennen, dass es nicht nur um große Projekte im Norden geht, sondern um die Anhebung niedriger Einkommen überall? Diese Ergebnisse werden die Herzen der Konservativen höher schlagen lassen, Labour jedoch vor schmerzhafte Dilemmata stellen. Die Bekämpfung der Ungleichheit ist das große Anliegen von Labour, aber das mag bei zu vielen Wählern ein abstoßendes Wort sein. Paul Johnson erinnert sich: „Tony Blair hat Ungleichheit nie erwähnt, aber mit Steuergutschriften mehr als jede andere Regierung zur Linderung der Armut beigetragen.“ Blair sprach stattdessen von „sozialer Ausgrenzung“. Diejenigen, die Keir Starmer für seine Vorsicht kritisieren, sollten diesen Bericht gründlich studieren. Am deprimierendsten ist, wie viele Menschen Erfolg und Misserfolg nur auf harte Arbeit und Ehrgeiz zurückführen: Die Menschen glauben, dass dies eine Meritokratie ist, kein System, das von Geburt und Glück bestimmt wird. Prof. Duffy sprach darüber, wie seit den 1970er Jahren die individuelle Schuld die systemische Ungerechtigkeit als Erklärung der Menschen für Ungleichheit ersetzt hat. Großbritannien war 1975 am ausgeglichensten, aber mit der Explosion des Thatcherismus, der die Spitzeneinkommen aufhob und die unteren Einkommen zurückfielen, kam eine Dosis amerikanisierten Individualismus. Mehr als die Hälfte der Belegschaft gehörte in den 1970er Jahren einer Gewerkschaft an, und sie dienten nicht nur der Macht, sondern auch der politischen Bildung. Jetzt sind nur noch 23 % Mitglieder und der politische Einfluss der Gewerkschaften im öffentlichen Diskurs ist schwach. An die Stelle des Kollektivs tritt ein verzerrtes Verdienstverständnis, das von der Rechten verbreitet wird und bewusst die sozialen Ungerechtigkeiten ignoriert, die die Zukunft von Geburt an prädestinieren. Da wir in Hoffnung leben und dennoch am Realismus festhalten müssen, legt diese Studie nahe, dass der beste Weg, Wähler mit Ungleichheit zu beschäftigen, die Lokalität und der Ort sind. Aber flüstere das Wort.	Es ist herzlos, Arbeitslose für den Verlust von Arbeitsplätzen verantwortlich zu machen – aber so denkt Großbritannien	partially false
b88444d1	"Geplante Kürzungen der Staatsausgaben werden dazu führen, dass mindestens 22.000 Polizeistellen verloren gehen, wodurch die Öffentlichkeit durch die niedrigste Zahl von Beamten seit den 1970er Jahren geschützt wird, so eine private Schätzung, die unter Polizeichefs kursiert. Die vom Guardian ermittelte Zahl ist viel höher als bisher bekannt und bedeutet, dass die Zahl der Polizeibeamten in England und Wales auf fast 100.000 sinken könnte. Die Schätzung, die den Chief Constables vorgelegt wird, basiert auf der niedrigsten erwarteten Kürzung von 25 % bei den Mitteln, die die Regierung für die Polizeiarbeit bis 2020 bereitstellt. Derzeit arbeiten in England und Wales etwa 125.000 Beamte. Nach dem Budget im Juli von der neu gewählten konservativen Regierung sagte Kanzler George Osborne ungeschützten Abteilungen wie dem Innenministerium, das die Polizei finanziert, dass ihre Kürzungen zwischen 25 % und 40 % liegen würden. Beamte des Senior Home Office und die Polizei haben sich in einer „Goldgruppe“ getroffen, um Argumente für das Finanzministerium vor seiner Entscheidung darüber zu formulieren, wie viel mehr jede Abteilung sparen sollte. Das Geld, das jede Regierungsabteilung erhält, wird in der umfassenden Ausgabenüberprüfung bekannt gegeben, die im November angekündigt werden soll. Ein hochrangiger Beamter sagte dem Guardian: „Diesmal wird ein größerer Teil der Kürzung von den Polizisten getragen.“ Ein Polizeichef fügte hinzu, dass die Kürzungen weniger Beamte und eine Reduzierung der Nachbarschaftspolizei und der proaktiven Präventionsarbeit bedeuten würden, was den Anstieg der Kriminalität stoppen würde. Insgeheim glauben Polizeichefs, dass die Öffentlichkeit das Ausmaß der Kürzungen und ihre Bedeutung nicht zu schätzen weiß. Sie haben sich angesichts der umfassenderen Kürzungen der öffentlichen Ausgaben mit weiteren Kürzungen abgefunden und gehen davon aus, dass ihre Mittel von 2010 bis 2020 um mindestens 40 % oder mehr gekürzt werden Kürzungen unter der von den Konservativen geführten Koalitionsregierung zwischen 2010-15. Die Schätzung ist nicht die einzige, die unter höheren Offizieren kursiert. Eine alternative Prognose deutet darauf hin, dass die Zahl der Offiziersverluste in den nächsten fünf Jahren bei den 43 Polizeikräften in England und Wales mit 30.000 höher sein könnte. Letzten Monat gab es Kontroversen, nachdem Sara Thornton, die Vorsitzende des Gremiums, das die Polizeichefs vertritt, sagte, dass ein Polizist nicht jedem Einbruch beiwohnen dürfe. Polizeiquellen argumentieren privat, dass die Öffentlichkeit eine Rationierung bei der Polizei nicht akzeptiert. Polizeichefs sagen, dass sich die Polizeiarbeit ändern wird, umso mehr, wenn in den nächsten fünf Jahren höhere Kürzungen von annähernd 40 % verhängt werden, weil es keine einfachen Effizienzeinsparungen mehr gibt. Die Kürzungen von 2010 bis 2015 wurden durch Effizienzeinsparungen, den Verkauf von Gebäuden und den Verlust von Zivilpersonal ausgeglichen. Privat geben Polizeichefs zu, dass sie 2010 auf 12 % des Budgets verzichten konnten und sich unter Labour an Zeiten relativen finanziellen Überflusses gewöhnt hatten. Sie argumentieren jedoch, dass die Ära der Kürzungen ohne Auswirkungen auf den Service längst vorbei sei. Im Jahr 2010, als die Kürzungen begannen, gab es 143.734 Vollzeitpolizisten sowie 16.900 PCSOs von Polizeibeamten zur Unterstützung der Gemeinschaft und 83.000 Zivilangestellte. Jetzt gibt es 125.000 Polizisten und insgesamt 35.000 Mitarbeiter und Beamte, die von 2010 bis 2015 verloren gegangen sind. Die kleine Sussex-Truppe, die sich mit dem Flugzeugabsturz in Shoreham befasste, plant, mindestens weitere 500 Offiziere zu verlieren. Matt Webb, Vorsitzender der Sussex Police Federation, die einfache Beamte vertritt, sagte: „Wir haben letztes Mal andere Kosten zurückgefahren. Um diese Einsparungen irgendwann weiter zu erzielen, muss man die Personalkosten reduzieren.“ Er sagte, die Polizei von Sussex erwäge, ihre Reaktion auf Vorfälle auf niedriger Ebene wie Ladendiebstahl, bei dem angeblich wenig gestohlen wird, und Einbrüche in Nichtwohngebäuden, die auf Unternehmen oder Lagereinheiten abzielen, zu reduzieren oder zu beenden. Die Polizei der West Midlands, die zweitgrößte Truppe, schätzt, dass sie sich in einem Jahrzehnt fast halbiert haben wird, von insgesamt 14.000 Mitarbeitern im Jahr 2010 auf 8.000 im Jahr 2020, wobei wiederum von einem niedrigeren Kürzungsniveau ausgegangen wird. Die Polizei von Greater Manchester erwartet einen ähnlichen Personalabbau. Mike Penning, Minister für Polizeiarbeit, Kriminalität, Strafjustiz und Opfer, sagte: „Die Polizeireform funktioniert. In den letzten fünf Jahren wurden die Dienste an vorderster Front geschützt, das Vertrauen der Öffentlichkeit in die Polizei ist gestiegen und die Kriminalität ist um mehr als ein Viertel zurückgegangen, so die unabhängige Kriminalitätserhebung für England und Wales. „Es steht außer Frage, dass die Polizei immer noch über die Ressourcen verfügt, um ihre wichtige Arbeit zu erledigen. Entscheidend ist, wie die Beamten eingesetzt werden, nicht wie viele es insgesamt sind. „Die Änderungen, die die Regierung seit 2010 vorgenommen hat, haben es der Polizei erleichtert, ihre Arbeit zu erledigen, indem sie Bürokratie abgebaut, unnötige Ziele abgeschafft und den Streitkräften die Möglichkeit gegeben haben, ihr professionelles Urteilsvermögen einzusetzen. Entscheidungen über den operativen Einsatz von Ressourcen wie PCSOs sind Sache der Chief Constables in Zusammenarbeit mit Polizei- und Kriminalkommissaren.“ Die Konservativen sagen, sie hätten das Geld gekürzt, das die Polizei den Steuerzahler gekostet habe, und auch die Kriminalität gesenkt. Die Position der Regierung wurde in einer Rede dargelegt, die die Innenministerin Theresa May kurz nach dem Sieg der Konservativen bei den Parlamentswahlen im Mai vor der Polizeiföderation hielt. „Wir haben Ihre Gehälter und Renten reformiert, die Polizeiausgaben gesenkt und ja, es gibt insgesamt weniger Beamte“, sagte May. „Aber – trotz der Vorhersagen des Verbandes und trotz der Vorhersagen der Politiker, die Ihnen einen falschen Traum von immer mehr Ausgaben verkaufen wollten – ist die Kriminalität seit 2010 um mehr als ein Viertel zurückgegangen, so die unabhängige Kriminalitätsumfrage für England und Wales."""

2562c7c0	Anfang Juni wusste niemand, was Artikel 50 ist. Jetzt weiß jeder: Es ist das EU-Recht im Vertrag von Lissabon, das den Austritt Großbritanniens aus der Europäischen Union auslösen wird. Wir wissen nicht, wann Premierministerin Theresa May Artikel 50 offiziell auslösen wird. Es könnte bereits in diesem Jahr oder in 10 Jahren geschehen. Fast jeder geht davon aus, dass es damit getan ist, sobald der Antrag des Vereinigten Königreichs nach Artikel 50 gestellt wurde. Waren aus. Kein Zurück mehr. Aber ... es gibt eine wenig bekannte Lücke in Artikel 50, die das Vereinigte Königreich in der EU halten würde, selbst nachdem der Antrag ausgelöst wurde. Grundsätzlich kann das Vereinigte Königreich seine Meinung ändern, nachdem der Artikel-50-Antrag gestellt wurde, solange keine endgültige Einigung über den Brexit erzielt wurde. Erstens ist dies der Wortlaut von Artikel 50: Ein Mitgliedstaat, der den Austritt beschließt, teilt dem Europäischen Rat seine Absicht mit. Im Lichte der vom Europäischen Rat vorgegebenen Leitlinien handelt die Union mit diesem Staat ein Abkommen aus und schließt es, in dem die Modalitäten für seinen Austritt festgelegt sind, und berücksichtigt dabei den Rahmen für seine künftigen Beziehungen zur Union. Dieses Abkommen wird gemäß Artikel 2183 des Vertrags über die Arbeitsweise der Europäischen Union ausgehandelt. Er wird im Namen der Union vom Rat mit qualifizierter Mehrheit nach Zustimmung des Europäischen Parlaments geschlossen. Jedes Land, das einen Antrag nach Artikel 50 stellt, hat zwei Jahre Zeit, um einen Pakt mit der EU zu schließen. Danach bist du raus. Aus logistischen Gründen wird das Vereinigte Königreich Artikel 50 wahrscheinlich erst auslösen, nachdem es einen Austrittsvertrag nach dem Geschmack der Regierung abgeschlossen hat. Das kann lange dauern. Aber selbst wenn das passiert, lässt uns Artikel 50 immer noch zurück. Die meisten Menschen glauben fälschlicherweise, dass der einzige Weg zurück in die EU über ein Ersuchen nach Artikel 49 führt. Jedes Land, das der EU beitreten möchte, muss Artikel 49 durchlaufen – das ist der Standardprozess für alle neuen Länder, und es dauert Jahre. Das Vereinigte Königreich würde am Ende dieser Linie stehen. Artikel 50 erwähnt sogar diesen Prozess, weshalb so viele Menschen denken, dass dies der einzige Weg zurück ist. Darin heißt es: Wenn ein Staat, der aus der Union ausgetreten ist, um Wiederbeitritt bittet, unterliegt sein Antrag dem in Artikel 49 genannten Verfahren ob Großbritannien seine Meinung ändern kann. Der Rat kam von Sir David Edward KCMG, QC, PC, FRSE, ehemaliger Richter am Gerichtshof der Europäischen Union und emeritierter Professor an der School of Law der Universität Edinburgh; und Professor Derrick Wyatt QC, emeritierter Professor für Rechtswissenschaften, Oxford University, und auch von Brick Court Chambers.

Lesen Sie unsere Datenschutzerklärung Hier ist ihre Empfehlung: Kann die Austrittsentscheidung eines Mitgliedstaats rückgängig gemacht werden? Wir haben unsere Zeugen gefragt, ob es möglich sei, eine Rückzugsentscheidung rückgängig zu machen. Beide waren sich einig, dass ein Mitgliedstaat eine Entscheidung zum Austritt aus der EU jederzeit vor dem Datum des Inkrafttretens des Austrittsabkommens rechtlich rückgängig machen kann. Mit Wirksamwerden des Austrittsabkommens war der Austritt jedoch endgültig. Sir David sagte uns: Es ist völlig klar, dass Sie nicht dazu gezwungen werden können, es durchzuziehen, wenn Sie es nicht wollen: zum Beispiel, wenn es einen Regierungswechsel gibt. Professor Wyatt untermauerte diese Ansicht mit der folgenden rechtlichen Analyse: Es gibt nichts im Wortlaut, das besagt, dass Sie es nicht können. Es entspricht den allgemeinen Zielen der Verträge, dass die Menschen drinnen bleiben, anstatt aus der Ausgangstür zu eilen. Es gibt auch die spezifische Bestimmung in Artikel 50, wonach ein Staat, wenn er austritt, einen Antrag auf Wiederaufnahme de novo stellen muss. Das gilt erst, wenn Sie gegangen sind. Wenn Sie Ihre Meinung nach einem Jahr Bedenkzeit nicht ändern konnten, aber vor dem Austritt, müssten Sie dann ein weiteres Jahr warten, sich zurückziehen und dann erneut einen Beitritt beantragen. Das macht einfach keinen Sinn. Die Analyse des Textes legt nahe, dass Sie berechtigt sind, Ihre Meinung zu ändern. ... Nichts in Artikel 50 hindert einen Mitgliedstaat förmlich daran, seine Entscheidung zum Austritt im Laufe der Austrittsverhandlungen rückgängig zu machen. Die politischen Folgen eines solchen Sinneswandels wären allerdings erheblich. Zusammenfassend lässt sich also sagen, dass wir, selbst wenn das Vereinigte Königreich Artikel 50 auslöst, diese Entscheidung immer noch aufheben können, wenn es beispielsweise zu einem Regierungswechsel kam. Aber die Regierung würde gegen die Uhr kämpfen: Sie müsste diese Kehrtwende machen, bevor der Rest der EU über den Artikel-50-Antrag abstimmt und bevor die Zweijahresfrist verstrichen ist. Angesichts dessen, wie lange der Austrittsprozess voraussichtlich dauern wird und wie unberechenbar die britische Politik plötzlich geworden ist, schließen Sie einen Regierungswechsel oder einen Sinneswandel nicht aus.

ffba0bf9	Die Nettomigration nach Großbritannien ist im Jahr bis September auf 273.000 gesunken, 49.000 weniger als im Vorjahr. Das Amt für nationale Statistik sagte, es sei das erste Mal seit zwei Jahren, dass die Zahl der Menschen, die in das Vereinigte Königreich einreisen und es verlassen, unter 300.000 gesunken sei. Aber das Ziel der Regierung von jährlich weniger als 100.000 wird verfehlt. Die Einwanderung wurde auf 596.000 geschätzt – darunter 268.000 EU-Bürger, 257.000 Nicht-EU-Bürger und 71.000 britische Staatsbürger. Dies beinhaltete die höchste jemals verzeichnete Zahl von Rumänen und Bulgaren - 74.000. Es wird angenommen, dass etwa 323.000 Menschen Großbritannien im Jahr bis September verlassen haben, 26.000 mehr als in den 12 Monaten bis September 2015. Davon waren 128.000 britische Staatsbürger, zusammen mit 103.000 EU-Bürgern und 93.000 Nicht-EU-Bürgern. line Analyse Von Dominic Casciani, Korrespondent für Inneres Die Nettomigration ist zurückgegangen. Aber obwohl der Nettorückgang beträchtlich erscheint, kann niemand mit Sicherheit sagen, was die Veränderung ausgelöst hat, da diese Quartalszahlen von einer Reihe kurzfristiger Faktoren beeinflusst worden sein könnten. Zunächst einmal scheint es einen Anstieg der Auswanderung gegeben zu haben – und wenn diese zunimmt, kann die Nettomigration sinken. Zweitens könnte ein Teil der Veränderung auf saisonale Schwankungen der Studierendenzahlen zurückzuführen sein. Drittens stieg die Zahl der Abgänger aus den ärmeren Ländern Rumänien und Bulgarien trotz erheblicher Abwanderung von Menschen aus einigen Teilen Osteuropas. Das Ergebnis ist, dass die Gesamtzahl der Menschen, die für einen Job ankommen, im Großen und Ganzen gleich ist. Worauf läuft das alles hinaus? Einwanderungsstatistiken sind eine ungenaue Wissenschaft - und im Moment ist es sehr schwierig, sicher zu wissen, was los ist. line Die Zahlen beinhalten erstmals Migrationsschätzungen nach dem EU-Referendum im Juni. Nicola White, Leiterin der internationalen Migrationsstatistik beim ONS, sagte, es sei noch zu früh, um zu sagen, welche Auswirkungen das Referendum auf die langfristige Migration hatte. Innenministerin Amber Rudd räumte ein, dass die Regierung noch weit davon entfernt sei, ihr Nettomigrationsziel zu erreichen, sagte aber, die Zahlen zeigten, dass wir die Einwanderung dort reduzieren können, wo wir sie kontrollieren können. Sie bestritt, dass die Zunahme von Menschen, die in Länder wie Polen zurückkehren, eine Unsicherheit der im Vereinigten Königreich lebenden EU-Bürger über ihre Zukunft widerspiegele. Frau Rudd sagte: Im Moment haben wir mit den EU-Mitgliedern eine offene Einwanderung, Freizügigkeit, sodass sie kommen und gehen können, wie sie wollen. Ich sehe keine besonders signifikante Veränderung innerhalb der EU-Migration. Die wirkliche Veränderung wird sein, wenn wir die EU verlassen, und dann werden wir in der Lage sein, selbst zu entscheiden, welches Maß an Einwanderung wir haben wollen. Und sie sagte, Großbritannien bleibe offen für EU-Bürger, die bereits hier leben und zur Wirtschaft beitragen, und sagte: Lassen Sie uns keinen Zweifel daran haben, dass das Vereinigte Königreich immer ein einladender Ort für Menschen sein wird, die hierher kommen, hier arbeiten und zu unserer beitragen wollen Wirtschaft. Sunder Katwala, Direktor des Think-Tanks British Future, sagte, die Zahlen zeigten, dass die Einwanderungsdebatte angesichts des Brexits weitergehen müsse. Er sagte: Ein einheitlicher Ansatz für die Einwanderung kann uns nicht dabei helfen, die Post-Brexit-Entscheidungen zu treffen, mit denen die Regierung und die Öffentlichkeit jetzt konfrontiert sind. Diagramm der Daten des Amtes für Nationale Statistik zur Migration Staatsangehörigkeitsniveau Unterdessen zeigen separate Zahlen des Innenministeriums, dass im vergangenen Jahr einer Rekordzahl von EU-Bürgern die britische Staatsbürgerschaft verliehen wurde. Die Staatsbürgerschaft wurde 16.754 Personen aus EU-Ländern verliehen, dem zweithöchsten Wert seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen, nach den 17.645 im Jahr 2013. Rund 6.498 Mitgliedern der EU-14-Länder – ältere Mitgliedstaaten wie Frankreich, Spanien und Deutschland – wurde die britische Staatsbürgerschaft verliehen 2016, 50 % mehr als in den vorangegangenen 12 Monaten und der höchste aller Zeiten für ein einzelnes Jahr. Weitere 6.813 Personen aus den EU-8-Ländern, darunter Polen, erhielten die britische Staatsbürgerschaft, ein Anstieg von 18 %, der nur von den Zahlen für 2013 übertroffen wurde. Die Staatsbürgerschaft wurde 3.215 Rumänen und Bulgaren verliehen, 20 % mehr als 2015 und erneut nur übertroffen Zahlen 2013. Weitere Punkte innerhalb der ONS-Statistiken waren: Ein Rückgang der Menschen, die aus acht osteuropäischen Ländern, die 2004 der EU beigetreten sind, nach Großbritannien kamen, um 10.000 auf 58.000 , der höchste Stand seit fünf Jahren Die Zahl der Nicht-EU-Bürger aus Afrika, Amerika und Ozeanien, die das Vereinigte Königreich verlassen, stieg um 11.000 auf 39.000 Die Mehrheit davon waren Nicht-EU-Bürger – 87.000, Rückgang um 31.000 Etwa 294.000 Menschen kamen im Jahr bis September 2016 nach Großbritannien, um dort zu arbeiten, darunter 180.000 EU-Bürger. Von diesen hatten 190.000 einen festen Arbeitsplatz, die höchste registrierte Schätzung, verglichen mit 169.000 im Vorjahr. Etwa 104.000 Menschen kamen auf der Suche nach Arbeit in das Vereinigte Königreich, gegenüber 120.000 im Vorjahr. 2016 wurden 38.517 Asylanträge gestellt. 2015 um 1.451 gesunken.

b2b1c493	Ein weiteres Erdbeben hat einen Fracking-Standort in Lancashire getroffen – dieses Mal erreichte es ein Niveau, in dem der Betrieb eingestellt werden muss. Es ist das 17. Erdbeben in 9 Tagen und wurde offiziell als „rotes Ereignis“ eingestuft. Das letzte – und größte – Beben ereignete sich heute Morgen an Land, wo das Energieunternehmen Cuadrilla nach Schiefergas bohrt. Aktivisten fordern ein Ende des Frackings nach dem letzten Beben in Lancashire. Bild: Getty M 0.8 rotes Ereignis, das am hydraulischen Fracking-Standort in Lancashire, Großbritannien, vom BGS aufgezeichnet und vom Betreiber Cuadrilla bestätigt wurde.

Die Vorschriften besagen jedoch, dass der Injektionsbetrieb für mindestens 18 Stunden unterbrochen werden muss, obwohl der feste Plan ist, morgen wieder zu beginnen. Aktivisten, die einen Antrag des Obersten Gerichtshofs verloren haben, Fracking zu stoppen, haben nach den jüngsten Beben den festen Stopp gefordert. Der Fracking-Standort Cuadrilla in Preston New Road, Little Plumpton, Lancashire, wo der Betrieb letzte Woche wieder aufgenommen wurde. Bild: PA Rose Dickinson, Aktivistin von Friends of the Earth, sagte: „Fracking hat erst vor 11 Tagen begonnen. In dieser Zeit gab es 17 Erdbeben, darunter eines, das heute eine rote Warnstufe erreicht hat – was bedeutet, dass die Arbeiten auf der Baustelle eingestellt werden müssen. „Dies ist offensichtlich zutiefst besorgniserregend für die in der Nähe lebenden Personen und warum die Branche genau überwacht werden muss. „Wir wissen seit langem, dass Fracking Risiken für unsere Umwelt und unser Klima birgt. Wann wird die Regierung erkennen, dass Fracking die falsche Wahl für Lancashire, das Vereinigte Königreich und unser globales Klima ist?“ Im Jahr 2011 wurde Fracking für sieben Jahre eingestellt, nachdem Experten sagten, dass zwei Beben in Lancashire – eines mit einer Stärke von 2,3 – durch Schiefergas verursacht wurden Probebohrungen.

f2a01c39	Erhöhungen der Sozialversicherungsbeiträge NICS für Selbständige wurden als Benachteiligung von Unternehmern kritisiert. Bundeskanzler Philip Hammond kündigte im Budget an, dass der Satz für NICS der Klasse 4 von 9 % auf 10 % im April 2018 und auf 11 % im Jahr 2019 steigen würde. Im Vergleich zu 12 %, die derzeit von Mitarbeitern gezahlt werden. Der Unterschied in den Sozialversicherungsbeiträgen sei nicht länger gerechtfertigt, sagte Herr Hammond. Selbstständige zahlen traditionell niedrigere NICS als Angestellte, da sie weniger staatliche Leistungen erhalten. Aber die Kanzlerin sagte, Selbständige hätten jetzt gleichberechtigten Zugang zur neuen gesetzlichen Rente. Er sagte auch, dass die Regierung über das Elterngeld beraten werde, von dem einige Selbständige keinen Anspruch haben. Die Kanzlerin sagte, alle Selbständigen, die weniger als 16.250 Pfund verdienten, würden besser dran sein. Rund die Hälfte der 4,8 Millionen als selbstständig registrierten Arbeitnehmer verdient laut der Denkfabrik Resolution Foundation weniger als 13.000 Pfund. Infolgedessen werde es den meisten dieser Arbeitnehmer – wie etwa schlecht bezahlten Friseuren – bis 2019/20 besser gehen. line Gewinner und Verlierer hairdresserimage copyrightGetty Images Ein selbstständiger Friseur – mit einem Durchschnittsverdienst von 12.700 £ – wird um 70 £ besser gestellt sein. Ein selbstständiger Taxifahrer – mit einem durchschnittlichen Verdienst von 17.300 £ – wird um 20 £ schlechter gestellt sein. Ein Selbstständiger Unternehmensberater – mit einem Durchschnittsverdienst von 51.100 £ – wird um 620 £ schlechter gestellt sein. Quelle: Resolution Foundation line Doch der Anstieg, der die Betroffenen durchschnittlich 60 Pence pro Woche kosten wird, wurde von Unternehmern kritisiert. Die Erhöhung der Sozialversicherungssätze für Selbstständige könnte ein weiterer Schritt der Regierung sein, um diejenigen zu bestrafen, die Risiken eingehen und ein Unternehmen gründen, sagte Lucy-Rose Walker, Geschäftsführerin von Entrepreneurial Spark. Andere meinten, es sei unfair, dass Selbständige mehr zahlen müssten, wenn sie nicht die gleichen staatlichen Leistungen erhalten. Selbständige unterliegen einem niedrigeren Sozialversicherungsbeitrag, da sie nicht die gleichen Ansprüche und Leistungen erhalten wie ihre angestellten Kollegen – wie Urlaub und Krankenstand, sagte Chas Roy-Chowdhury, Leiter der Steuerabteilung bei der Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.

Matthew Taylor, Leiter der Royal Society of Arts, wird noch in diesem Jahr einen Bericht darüber vorlegen, wie Selbständige besteuert werden.

e5a08193	Bildrechte Getty Images Beschäftigte mit Null-Stunden-Verträgen, Zeitarbeitskräfte oder Gig-Economy-Beschäftigte sollen durch ein Paket von Arbeitsplatzreformen besser geschützt werden, so die Regierung. Nach einer neuen Gesetzgebung, die am Montag eingeführt werden soll, müssten die Mitarbeiter vom ersten Arbeitstag an über Einzelheiten ihrer Rechte informiert werden, einschließlich des Anspruchs auf bezahlten und krankheitsbedingten Urlaub. Die Arbeitnehmer würden auch das Recht erhalten, vorhersehbarere Stunden zu verlangen. Aber Labour und die Gewerkschaften sagen, dass die geplanten Reformen nicht weit genug gehen. Die Reformen basieren auf den Ergebnissen einer Untersuchung moderner Arbeitspraktiken unter der Leitung von Matthew Taylor, einem ehemaligen Berater von Ex-PM Tony Blair und Geschäftsführer der Royal Society of Arts. Die Minister sagen, dass die neue Gesetzgebung: ein Schlupfloch schließen wird, das Leiharbeitskräften erlaubte, weniger als festangestellte Angestellte zu bezahlen sicherzustellen, dass Unternehmen am ersten Tag der Beschäftigung einer Person eine Erklärung über ihre Rechte vorlegen müssen, in der dargelegt wird, auf welchen bezahlten Urlaub sie Anspruch haben , einschließlich für Krankheit, Mutterschafts- und Vaterschaftsurlaub, erhöhen die maximale Geldbuße, mit der Arbeitgeber vor einem Gericht konfrontiert sind, von 5.000 £ auf 20.000 £, wenn festgestellt wird, dass sie Bosheit, Bosheit oder grobes Versehen demonstriert haben. Stellen Sie sicher, dass Unternehmen das Urlaubsgeld auf der Grundlage von 52 berechnen müssen Wochen, im Gegensatz zu 12 Wochen, damit Menschen in saisonalen oder atypischen Positionen die bezahlte Freizeit erhalten, die ihnen zusteht, sagte Wirtschaftsminister Greg Clark: Die heutige größte Verbesserung der Arbeitnehmerrechte seit über einer Generation ist ein Schlüsselelement beim Aufbau eines Arbeitsmarktes das weiterhin Menschen für harte Arbeit belohnt, gute Arbeitgeber feiert und die Produktivität und das Verdienstpotenzial in ganz Großbritannien steigert. Frances O'Grady, Generalsekretärin des Trades Union Congress, sagte jedoch: Das Recht, garantierte Arbeitszeiten zu verlangen, ist kein Recht. Null-Stunden-Vertragsarbeiter werden nicht mehr Einfluss haben als Oliver Twist. Wenn die Gewerkschaften nicht das Recht bekommen, sich zu organisieren und für Arbeiter in Unternehmen wie Uber und Amazon zu verhandeln, werden zu viele Arbeiter weiterhin wie Wegwerfarbeitskräfte behandelt, fügte sie hinzu. Bildrechte Getty Images Matthew Fell, Chief Policy Director UK bei CBI, sagte: [Unternehmen] begrüßen ein neues Gesetz, das allen Arbeitnehmern das Recht gibt, vorhersehbarere Arbeitszeiten zu verlangen, was dazu beitragen wird, die Gespräche zu erleichtern, die für die Gewährleistung von Flexibilitätsvorteilen unerlässlich sind beide Parteien. Aber er sagte: Die Gesetzgebung zur Änderung der Beschäftigungsstatusregelungen birgt die Gefahr, dass das Gesetz künftig weniger an neue Formen der Arbeit angepasst werden kann. Die Regierung stimmt der Taylor-Überprüfung zu, dass ein vollständiges Verbot von Null-Stunden-Verträgen mehr Menschen negativ beeinflussen würde, als es geholfen hat. Es hieß auch, dass plattformbasiertes Arbeiten – einschließlich der Mitfahrgelegenheits-App Uber oder des Lebensmittellieferdienstes Deliveroo – eine echte Flexibilität in beide Richtungen für Unternehmen und Arbeitnehmer bietet. Sehr umstritten sind Null-Stunden-Verträge, bei denen ein Arbeitgeber keine Arbeit anbieten muss und ein Arbeitnehmer auf Anfrage keine Arbeitsverpflichtung hat. Der Erzbischof von Canterbury nannte die Verträge die Reinkarnation eines uralten Übels.	Arbeitsplatzreformen „werden Gig-Economy-Arbeiter schützen“	false
8761c91b	Nick Ansell/PA Wire File Foto vom 15/12/14 der Vorsitzenden der Grünen Partei von England und Wales Natalie Bennett, die Behauptungen zurückgewiesen hat, dass sie sagte, in Indien arm zu sein, sei nicht so schlimm wie in Großbritannien Sozialleistungen zu beziehen. Die Vorsitzende der Grünen, Natalie Bennett, sagte, sie sei zutiefst enttäuscht, nachdem die Medienregulierungsbehörde Ofcom sagte, sie glaube, die Grünen seien nicht wichtig genug, um in die im Fernsehen übertragenen Parlamentsdebatten aufgenommen zu werden. In einer am Donnerstag veröffentlichten Konsultation sagte Ofcom, es glaube nicht, dass die Grünen als große Partei qualifiziert sind, die aufgenommen werden sollte, aber es sagte, dass Ukip sich für den Status einer großen Partei in England und Wales qualifizieren könnte“, obwohl es versäumt hat, nachgewiesene bedeutende vergangene Wahlen nachzuweisen Unterstützung bei Bundestagswahlen“. Die Entscheidung ist ein Schlag für Bennetts Partei, da die als große Parteien eingestuften Parteien im Vorfeld der Parlamentswahlen mindestens zwei Parteiwahlübertragungen erhalten dürfen. Ofcom könnte seine Ansicht jedoch noch ändern, da seine erste Bewertung den Beginn einer Konsultation markiert, die bis zum 5. Februar läuft. Bennett reagierte mit Wut auf Ofcoms erstes Urteil in einem Blog für The Huffington Post UK und schrieb: Offensichtlich bin ich als Vorsitzender der Grünen Partei zutiefst enttäuscht von dieser Entscheidung, aber als Wähler und Bürger mache ich mir auch große Sorgen darüber die möglichen Auswirkungen auf die britische Demokratie, wenn diese Haltung in der endgültigen Anleitung beibehalten wird. Ofcom ignoriert nicht nur die Ansichten der 275.000 Menschen, die die Petition unterzeichnet haben, in der gefordert wird, dass die Grünen in die von den Sendern vorgeschlagenen Debatten der Führer einbezogen werden, sondern auch die Beweise, dass 79 % der Öffentlichkeit uns in diesen Debatten sehen wollen und 85 % von Frauen. Sie fuhr fort: Ich denke, wir haben Leute in Machtpositionen, die sehr feste Vorstellungen davon haben, wie Politik aussieht und klingt, denken, dass es im Grunde ein unveränderliches Ringen zwischen den traditionellen großen Zwei ist, mit ein paar Satelliten, die sich in die Politik quetschen Lücken, ohne wirklich etwas anderes zu sagen. Wenn Sie die Unterstützung für die Grünen Parteien von England und Wales, Schottland und Nordirland mit denen für die Scottish National Party und Plaid Cymru zusammenzählen, gibt es eine sehr starke Unterstützung für eine Anti-Austeritäts-Alternative zum Coalition-Labour-Ansatz, wie Nicola Sturgeon, Leanne Wood und ich letzten Monat betonten. Dies kommt, nachdem Labour-Spitzenbänkler Sadiq Khan Forderungen unterstützte, die Grünen in die Wahldebatten einzubeziehen, und dem New Statesman sagte: Was die britische Öffentlichkeit verdient zu sehen, sind alle Führer, und dazu gehört übrigens auch Natalie Bennett, die eine Debatte führt über ihre Vision für das Land, ihre Analyse der letzten fünf Jahre, eine Erklärung von Cameron und Clegg, dass das Defizit immer noch 200 Milliarden Pfund höher ist, als sie vorhergesagt haben. Die Entscheidung von Ofcom hat die Augenbrauen hochgezogen, da die Grünen bereits begonnen haben, bessere Umfragewerte als die Lib Dems zu veröffentlichen. Recherchen für den konservativen Kollegen Lord Ashcroft brachten die Partei auf einen neuen Höchststand von 8 % – plus drei Punkte – und knapp vor den Lib Dems mit 7 %.

62b8396b	Laut einem neuen Bericht werden Schüler in den meisten Sekundarschulen von Personal unterrichtet, das in dem Fach, das sie unterrichten, nicht ausgebildet ist. Eine Umfrage unter 885 Schulen durch die Association of School and College Leaders, die Sekundarschulleiter vertritt, zeigt, dass 73 Prozent Lehrer, die nicht in dem Fach, das sie unterrichten, ausgebildet sind, vor den Unterricht stellen mussten. Darüber hinaus gaben 84 Prozent an, dass sich der Lehrermangel nachteilig auf die von ihnen angebotene Bildung auswirkt. Die Fachbereiche, die am stärksten von dem, was ASCL-Präsident Allan Foulds als „nationale Krise“ bezeichnet hat, betroffen sind, sind Mathematik, wo 78 Prozent der Schulen mit nicht in diesem Fach ausgebildetem Personal auskommen müssen, Naturwissenschaften 75 Prozent und Englisch 57 Prozent . Andere Problembereiche sind Sprachen mit 33 Prozent der Schulen, die nicht spezialisierte Lehrkräfte einsetzen, Erdkunde 25 Prozent und Geschichte 14 Prozent. Insgesamt gaben 89 Prozent an, Schwierigkeiten bei der Rekrutierung von Lehrkräften zu haben. Letzten Monat gab das National Audit Office bekannt, dass das Bildungsministerium seine Einstellungsziele für angehende Lehrer in den letzten vier Jahren nicht erreicht hat. Der Chief Inspector of Schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, warnte letzte Woche auch vor einem „Brain Drain“, da sich die Lehrer für Jobs in Satellitenschulen im Ausland entscheiden, die von vielen der führenden unabhängigen Schulen des Landes eingerichtet wurden. Die Umfrage fällt mit der Jahreskonferenz der ASCL an diesem Wochenende zusammen, bei der der Bildungsminister Nicky Morgan voraussichtlich unter Druck gesetzt wird, Maßnahmen gegen den Lehrermangel zu ergreifen. „Der Lehrermangel lässt den Schulen keine andere Wahl, als Überbrückungslösungen zu verwenden“, sagte Malcolm Trobe, ASCL-Generalsekretär. „Versorgungspersonal und Laien leisten unter schwierigen Umständen oft gute Arbeit, aber es ist kein Ersatz für fest angestellte Lehrer, die Experten in ihren Fächern sind.“ Bitte geben Sie Ihre E-Mail-Adresse ein.

d462dc8d	Ein Blitzschlag, um Menschen mit Alkohol-, Drogen- und anderen Problemen bei der Arbeitssuche zu helfen, soll gestartet werden, nachdem sich herausgestellt hat, dass sie den Steuerzahler 10 Milliarden Pfund pro Jahr kosten. Iain Duncan Smith enthüllte die Zahl gestern, als er ein Jobcenter-Programm versprach, um die Sucht zu identifizieren, die Antragsteller davon abhält, Arbeit zu finden. Im Rahmen des universellen Unterstützungssystems übernehmen Beamte die persönliche Verantwortung für jeden Fall, um sicherzustellen, dass sie Behandlung, psychologische Beratung und andere Unterstützung erhalten. Iain Duncan Smith sagte, es koste den Steuerzahler 10,1 Milliarden Pfund pro Jahr, um drogenabhängige Menschen zu unterstützen. Sobald die Menschen einen Job gefunden haben, bleiben sie unter der Obhut des Arbeitsamts, bis sie genügend Stunden leisten, um die begleitenden Universalkreditleistungen zu verlassen Regime überhaupt. Der Arbeits- und Rentenminister sagte, das Ziel sei es, Arbeitsplätze für Menschen zu finden, die von der letzten Regierung auf ein Leben mit Leistungen „geparkt“ worden seien. Herr Duncan Smith fügte hinzu: „In der Vergangenheit wurden Menschen mit komplexen Barrieren wie Sucht, Verschuldung oder Obdachlosigkeit zu oft auf ein Leben mit Sozialleistungen abgeschrieben. „Durch Universal Support machen wir dem ein Ende und bieten Rundum-Support für diejenigen, die ihn benötigen. „Diese Probleme sind die Hauptursachen der Armut – und wenn sie nicht angegangen werden, bedeutet dies, dass sich der Kreislauf der Benachteiligung bis in die nächste Generation fortsetzt.“ Er verwies auf einen niederschmetternden Bericht der Lankelly Chase Foundation, in dem die höheren Kosten für den Steuerzahler durch die Unterstützung von Menschen festgestellt wurden mit den schwersten Problemen betrug 10,1 Milliarden Pfund pro Jahr. Herr Duncan Smith, abgebildet, wurde von der Kirche wegen seiner Wohlfahrtsreformen heftig kritisiert. Es gibt 586.000 Menschen, denen mindestens ein ernsthaftes Problem zugeschrieben wird – wie Alkohol- oder Drogensucht oder Obdachlosigkeit. Beamte sagten, das Ziel sei es, die Kosten des sozialen Zusammenbruchs zu senken, indem alle „Barrieren“ angegangen werden, mit denen sie konfrontiert sind, um im Leben voranzukommen und einen Job zu finden. Einer sagte: „Es geht nicht darum, Leistungen zu kürzen – es geht darum, den Bedarf zu verringern.“ Herr Duncan Smith enthüllte, dass das Gesundheitsministerium zum ersten Mal anerkannt habe, dass eine Arbeit die Gesundheit und das Wohlbefinden einer Person verbessert. Die neue Richtlinie wird Menschen, die behaupten, dass psychische Gesundheitsprobleme sie daran hindern, eine Arbeit zu finden, Zugang zu mehr Unterstützung verschaffen. In etwa 60 Prozent der Fälle ist das Problem, das sie haben, Angst oder Depression. Es wird auch Hilfe für Menschen geben, die Probleme mit der Wohnung, der Kinderbetreuung, Schulden und einer Vorgeschichte von Straftaten haben. Herr Duncan Smith wurde von der Kirche und Kritikern der Linken wegen seiner Sozialreformen heftig kritisiert, von denen sie behaupteten, dass sie „inakzeptables“ Leid verursachen würden. Aber nach einer Reihe von Änderungen am Sozialleistungssystem, die Arbeitsanreize schaffen sollen, ist die Zahl der Kinder, die in Haushalten aufwachsen, in denen niemand eine Arbeit hat, um 478.000 eingebrochen. Die Gesamtzahl der Haushalte, in denen niemand erwerbstätig war, fiel 2015 auf den niedrigsten Stand seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen – fast 700.000 weniger als 2010.

0adec63d	Lokalen Gesundheitsdiensten werden heute 570 Milliarden Pfund zur Finanzierung von NHS-Diensten und zur Umsetzung des neuen langfristigen Plans zugewiesen. Jeder Bereich in England wird in den nächsten fünf Jahren eine Bargelderhöhung von mindestens 17 % erhalten, einschließlich einer Mindesterhöhung von 4,4 % im nächsten Jahr. Etwa 1 Milliarde Pfund pro Jahr werden entsprechend dem größten Bedarf verteilt, wobei eine neu entwickelte, gerechtere Finanzierungsformel zusätzliches Geld an Orte mit den höchsten Raten an frühen Todesfällen und ungedeckten Gesundheitsbedürfnissen weiterleitet. Andere Änderungen werden ab April mehr Investitionen bedeuten, die erstmals auf Gebiete mit höherem Bedarf an kommunalen Diensten ausgerichtet sind, und dem Bedarf an psychosozialen Diensten größere Beachtung schenken. Die Zuweisung von Mitteln für lokale Clinical Commissioning Groups folgt auf die Veröffentlichung des langfristigen NHS-Plans, in dem die Prioritäten des Gesundheitswesens für das nächste Jahrzehnt festgelegt sind. Simon Stevens, Geschäftsführer von NHS England, sagte: „Diese Finanzierung unterstützt die Umsetzung des langfristigen NHS-Plans in allen Teilen Englands für die nächsten fünf Jahre. „Es wird hochmoderne Behandlungen wie Genomtests für jedes krebskranke Kind finanzieren, Gemeinschaftsdienste aufbauen, um eine stärker vernetzte Versorgung zu gewährleisten, Krankenhäuser entlasten und den ungedeckten Bedarf an psychiatrischen Diensten decken. „Bei der Bekämpfung gesundheitlicher Ungleichheiten in unserer Gesellschaft geht es nicht nur um Fairness, sondern um eine Frage hartnäckiger Ökonomie, die nicht nur Leben retten, sondern auch das Geld der Steuerzahler und die Zeit des NHS-Personals sparen wird. „Die Öffentlichkeit kann darauf vertrauen, dass der NHS jeden Cent zählen wird. Die gestern vom Office for National Statistics veröffentlichten Daten zeigen, dass die Produktivität der Gesundheitsdienste in England 2016/17 um 3 % gestiegen ist, mehr als das Dreifache des Wachstums im gesamten Vereinigten Königreich Wirtschaft in diesem Jahr.“ Im Rahmen der neuen gerechteren Finanzierungsformel werden zwei der Gebiete mit den schlechtesten Raten für vorzeitige Todesfälle, Blackpool und Bradford City, allein im nächsten Jahr Erhöhungen von 11 % bzw. 13 % erhalten, was bedeutet, dass sie 40 Mio. GBP bzw. 26 Mio. GBP mehr investieren müssen. Der am Montag vorgestellte NHS-Langzeitplan wird jedes Jahr schätzungsweise 85.000 weitere Leben retten, indem er tödliche Krankheiten wie Krebs und Herzprobleme früher erkennt und sich erneut auf die Prävention konzentriert. Die Maßnahmen werden dazu beitragen, 150.000 Herzinfarkte, Schlaganfälle und Demenzfälle zu verhindern, während mehr als drei Millionen Menschen in den nächsten zehn Jahren von neuen und verbesserten Schlaganfall-, Beatmungs- und Herzdiensten profitieren werden. Es gibt auch eine neue, historische Garantie, dass die Investitionen in die primäre, kommunale und psychische Gesundheitsversorgung schneller wachsen werden als das wachsende Gesamtbudget des NHS. Damit wird ein neues Servicemodell in Höhe von 4,5 Milliarden £ für das 21. Jahrhundert in ganz England finanziert, bei dem Gesundheitseinrichtungen zusammenkommen, um in Partnerschaft mit der lokalen Regierung eine bessere, vernetzte Versorgung bereitzustellen. Die Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung schwerwiegender körperlicher Erkrankungen gehen mit der größten Investition aller Zeiten in psychische Gesundheitsdienste einher, die bis 2023/24 auf mindestens 2,3 Mrd. GBP pro Jahr steigen wird.	Der lokale NHS stellte 570 Mrd. £ zur Finanzierung des langfristigen NHS-Plans bereit	false
98e344da	Menschenrechtsgesetze kosten Großbritannien 42 Milliarden Pfund an Urteilen und Auszahlungen Die Mitgliedschaft im Europäischen Gerichtshof für Menschenrechte hat die britischen Steuerzahler einem Bericht zufolge mehr als 42 Milliarden Pfund gekostet. Der Gesetzentwurf zur Befolgung seiner Urteile hat dazu geführt, dass Geld in Rechtsstreitigkeiten geworfen und von wesentlichen Dienstleistungen abgezweigt wurde, wird behauptet. Das Gericht mit Sitz in Straßburg, Frankreich, hat das Parlament sogar gezwungen, eine Reihe von britischen Gesetzen aufzuheben. Es brachte die Regierung sogar dazu, Gefangenen das Wahlrecht zu geben – trotz heftigen Widerstands von Ministern und der Öffentlichkeit. Law and Order: Der Europäische Gerichtshof für Menschenrechte in Straßburg, Frankreich, wo die Mitgliedschaft Großbritannien Milliarden kostet Totalitarismus. Die Studie darüber, wie viel die Konvention und ihr Gericht Großbritannien gekostet haben, das 1950 Unterzeichner wurde, wurde von der TaxPayers’ Alliance durchgeführt. Dr. Lee Rotherham, Autor des Berichts, sagte: „Fünfzig Jahre nach den Tagen von Stalin und Hitler wird das Straßburger Gericht nicht mehr benötigt, um uns vor einem Klopfen an der Tür um 3 Uhr morgens oder der Deportation mit einem Handkarren zu schützen. Es trägt eine zunehmend politische Agenda, die rücksichtslos unsere Gesetze und unsere Gerichte missachtet, zu hohen Kosten für den Steuerzahler und die Wirtschaft. „Im Heimatland der Magna Carta würde man sich wünschen, dass Politiker und Menschenrechtsanwälte mehr Selbstvertrauen haben. Australien, Neuseeland, Kanada und die Vereinigten Staaten kommen sehr gut damit zurecht, sich kontinentalen Menschenrechtsgerichten anzuschließen. Großbritannien kann das auch.“ Zu den umstrittenen Urteilen gehört, dass ein Transsexueller wegen Totschlags und versuchter Vergewaltigung in ein Frauengefängnis verlegt werden darf, obwohl er die Straftaten als Mann begangen hat. Das Gericht hat auch die Abschiebung von Ausländern verhindert, die wegen schwerer Straftaten für schuldig befunden wurden. Das Vereinigte Königreich verlor 1975 seinen ersten Fall vor dem von der EU unabhängigen Gericht und musste 1980 seinen ersten Schadensersatz zahlen. Der Bericht deutet an, dass Großbritannien mehr als drei Viertel – 331 von 418 – der verhandelten Fälle verloren hat in Straßburg. Der Human Rights Act von Labour aus dem Jahr 1998 sollte die Zahl der Berufungen nach Europa reduzieren, indem er die Straßburger Grundsätze vor britischen Gerichten anwandte. Die Rate verlorener Fälle hat sich jedoch verschlechtert. Die Kosten für die Einhaltung von Urteilen im Rahmen der Konvention belaufen sich bisher auf 17,3 Milliarden Pfund Sterling, heißt es in dem Bericht. Darüber hinaus hat das Wachstum einer vom Gericht geförderten Entschädigungskultur weitere 25 Milliarden Pfund an Kosten verursacht. Sian Herbert von der Denkfabrik Open Europe sagte: „Der EGMR und der Europäische Gerichtshof [der über das EU-Recht entscheidet] fungieren heute in vielerlei Hinsicht de facto als oberstes Gericht im Vereinigten Königreich. „Obwohl wir ein Land bleiben müssen, das sich dem starken Schutz der Grundfreiheiten und -rechte verschrieben hat, fehlt diesen beiden Gremien die demokratische und gerichtliche Legitimität, um diese Pflicht zu erfüllen.“	Menschenrechtsgesetze kosten Großbritannien 42 Milliarden Pfund an Urteilen und Auszahlungen	false

Bei der größten Abstimmung über die Beziehungen dieses Landes zu Brüssel seit 40 Jahren sagten 80 Prozent, dass sie nicht länger in Europa sein wollen, wie der Daily Express verraten kann. Es markiert einen großen Schritt nach vorn im Kreuzzug dieser Zeitung, Großbritannien aus der EU herauszuholen. Rund 14.581 Menschen haben abgestimmt – 11.706 von ihnen wollen, dass Großbritannien austritt, verglichen mit 2.725, die Teil der EU bleiben wollen. Das Mini-Referendum – das erste zu diesem Thema seit 1975 – wurde von zwei hochrangigen Tory-Hinterbänklern und einem angehenden Tory-Abgeordneten organisiert. Sie glauben, dass das überwältigende Ergebnis, das David Cameron heute präsentiert wird, ihn zwingen wird, seine geplante Abstimmung über die Zukunft Großbritanniens in Europa auf das nächste Jahr statt auf 2017 vorzuziehen. Das erdrutschartige Ergebnis übt weiteren Druck auf die aus Premierminister soll handeln, nur wenige Tage nachdem EU-Kommissionspräsident Jean-Claude Juncker die britische Mitgliedschaft in der EU mit einer zum Scheitern verurteilten Romanze verglich und vorschlug, dass es Zeit für Großbritannien sei, sich scheiden zu lassen. Die Tory-Umfrage wurde in drei benachbarten Parlamentswahlkreisen von Peter Bone, Abgeordneter für Wellingborough, Philip Hollobone, Abgeordneter für Kettering, und Tom Pursglove organisiert, der bei den diesjährigen Parlamentswahlen als Tory-Kandidat für Corby und East Northamptonshire kandidiert. GETTY Die Ergebnisse der Umfrage bestätigen, dass ein In-or-Out-Referendum im Jahr 2017 notwendig ist, wenn nicht früher. Nach der Zählung, die gestern in den Londoner Büros des Daily Express durchgeführt wurde, sagte Herr Bone: „Acht von 10 Personen, die Teilnehmer aus Europa herauskommen wollen – das ist außergewöhnlich. Es ist sehr, sehr, sehr klar, dass sie herauskommen wollen.“ Die Wahlbeteiligung, fügte er hinzu, zeige, dass ein „riesiges Interesse“ an einem landesweiten Referendum bestehe. „Menschen, die sich tatsächlich die Mühe machen, X auf einen Stimmzettel zu setzen, zeigen deutlich, dass sich die Menschen die Mühe gemacht haben, an einem Referendum teilzunehmen, und es besteht ein großes Interesse daran“, fügte er hinzu. „Nur die Konservativen werden uns das Referendum geben. Ukip kann das nicht und Labour und die Lib Dems werden es nicht tun.“ Herr Hollobone sagte, er erwarte, dass sich das Ergebnis landesweit widerspiegeln würde. „Mein Bauchgefühl ist, dass eine Mehrheit der Menschen im ganzen Land für einen Austritt stimmen würde“, sagte er. „Vielleicht nicht in dem Ausmaß, das wir in North Northamptonshire gesehen haben, aber dennoch eine Mehrheit. Das hätte ich vor 10 Jahren nicht gesagt.“ Wir werden keine Regierung unterstützen, die kein Referendum will Peter Bone	Botschaft ist laut und deutlich: Briten wollen EU verlassen	false
c142d136	Zum Zeitpunkt des Verfassens dieses Artikels waren über hunderttausend Menschen dem jüngsten Anfall falscher Empörung erlegen, indem sie eine Petition unterzeichneten, in der sie forderten, dass die königliche Familie für die Renovierung des Palastes aufkommt. Dies bezieht sich auf die jüngste Entscheidung der Regierung, die der königlichen Familie über den Sovereign Grant zugewiesene Zahlung zu erhöhen, um die Kosten von 369 Millionen Pfund für die Reparatur des Buckingham Palace zu decken, ohne dass größere Renovierungsarbeiten an den lebenswichtigen Arterien des Palastes durchgeführt wurden seit dem Zweiten Weltkrieg. Das Problem bei dieser Petition ist, dass sie entweder völlig unwissend darüber ist, wie die königliche Familie ihr Einkommen erhält und wie viel an den Staat abgeführt wird, oder dass sie die Fakten absichtlich beschönigt hat, um einen netten einfachen Klickköder zu verbreiten. Also werde ich versuchen, die Fakten zu präsentieren, die in dieser Petition weggelassen wurden, um den Sachverhalt richtigzustellen. Zuallererst ist der Buckingham Palace keine private Residenz, die der Königin oder einem anderen Monarchen gehört, der darin residiert. Es ist das Eigentum des Crown Estate, das verpflichtet ist, alle seine Einnahmen an HM Treasury abzugeben. Der Monarch des Tages darf im Palast residieren, ist aber auch verpflichtet, jedes Jahr Hunderte von Staatsveranstaltungen auszurichten, und wurde von der Regierung bei unzähligen Gelegenheiten als Teil ihrer Strategie der sanften Diplomatie eingesetzt, wenn es darum geht, Ausländer zu werben Führer. Zweitens ignoriert die Petition die Tatsache, dass das Krongut die Renovierung bereits mehrfach durch seine Beiträge zu den Staatseinnahmen bezahlt hat. Tatsächlich haben sie allein in den letzten zehn Jahren bereits sechsmal dafür bezahlt, nachdem sie in diesem Zeitraum 2,4 Milliarden Pfund an das Finanzministerium gezahlt haben. Das ist Geld, das für die Bezahlung des NHS, der Schulen und der Rettungsdienste verwendet wird. Allein im letzten Jahr übergaben sie 304,1 Millionen Pfund an die Staatskasse. Obwohl der Monarch etwas Geld aus den Gewinnen des Kronguts zurückerhält, wurde dieses durch den Sovereign Grant auf 15 % der Gewinne des Kronguts festgesetzt. Mit anderen Worten, es ist gleichbedeutend damit, dass Sie oder ich 85 % unseres Einkommens an Steuern abgeben. Aber selbst dann wird erwartet, dass der Sovereign Grant die Kosten aller offiziellen Geschäfte deckt, die von der Königin durchgeführt werden, oft im Namen der Regierung, die Sie und ich wählen. Es sollte keinen Zweifel daran geben, dass diese Arbeiten am Palast unerlässlich sind, aber das Wichtigste ist, dass das Krongut der Regierung in weniger als zwei Jahren genug Gewinn ausgehändigt haben wird, um die Kosten dieser notwendigen, aber vorübergehenden Erhöhung des Staatsvermögens vollständig zu decken Souveräner Zuschuss. Lassen Sie uns von unserer Königin loskommen und stolz darauf sein, dass das Crown Estate jedes Jahr so ​​viele Einnahmen für unsere lebenswichtigen öffentlichen Dienste generiert und dass dieses fantastische britische Gebäude für zukünftige Generationen – und Regierungen – erhalten bleibt, um die Vorteile zu ernten seine Größe.

Das gesetzliche Rentenalter soll in den nächsten 16 Jahren auf 75 Jahre ansteigen – basierend auf einem Plan der Lieblingsdenkfabrik des neuen Premierministers Boris Johnson. Es würde in nur neun Jahren auf 70 steigen, da die Änderung schrittweise eingeführt wird. Ein Bericht des Centre for Social Justice besagt, dass sich Großbritannien den aktuellen Plan, das Rentenalter auf 67 im Jahr 2028 und dann auf 68 bis 2046 anzuheben, nicht länger leisten kann es muss beschleunigt werden. Die Rentenrechnung ist von 17 Milliarden Pfund im Jahr 1989 auf jetzt 92 Milliarden Pfund gestiegen, was 4 Pfund pro 10 Pfund Sozialausgaben ausmacht, fügt der Bericht hinzu. Bis 2023 wird es 20 Milliarden Pfund mehr kosten, da die Bevölkerung altert und die Geburtenrate sinkt. Es schlägt vor, das förderfähige Alter bis 2028 auf 70 und bis 2035 auf 75 Jahre anzuheben. Bild: Reuters Die ersten Menschen, die wahrscheinlich von einer solchen Änderung betroffen sein werden, sind diejenigen, die zwischen dem 6. März 1961 und dem 5. April 1977 geboren wurden. Wohlfahrtskämpfer sind entsetzt über den Bericht und weisen darauf hin, dass angesichts der oft unbezahlbaren Betriebsrenten drei Viertel der britischen Senioren bis 2036 vollständig auf ihre staatlichen Zahlungen angewiesen sein werden. Die ehemalige Rentenministerin Ros Altmann fügte hinzu: „Dies könnte eine großartige Möglichkeit sein, öffentliche Gelder zu sparen, wird aber viel bewirken der Not. In Großbritannien gibt es große Unterschiede in der Lebenserwartung. Es muss eine Möglichkeit geben, dass diejenigen, die nicht arbeiten können, früher in Rente gehen können.“ Bild: PA Und Jan Shortt von der National Pensioners Convention fügte hinzu: „Je länger Sie arbeiten, desto kranker werden Sie und desto unwahrscheinlicher ist es, dass Sie überhaupt das Rentenalter erreichen.“ Das Center for Social Justice wird vom ehemaligen Sozialminister und Tory-Führer Iain Duncan Smith geleitet, und Tory-Regierungen beziehen viele ihrer Ideen daraus. Im Jahr 2009 erfand sie den Universalkredit, der ein Jahr später von Premierminister David Cameron als Politik eingeführt wurde. Sein Chef Andy Cook besteht darauf: „Länger zu arbeiten verbessert möglicherweise die Gesundheit und das Wohlbefinden – wir tun nicht genug, um älteren Menschen zu helfen, in Arbeit zu bleiben. Die gesetzliche Rente spiegelt keine gesunde Lebenserwartung wider.“ Bild: Getty Der Bericht behauptet auch, dass eine Million Briten im Rentenalter arbeiten wollen, aber keine Chefs finden können, die sie einstellen. Es schlägt ein System von „Midlife TÜV“ für ältere Mitarbeiter vor, das zu flexiblen Arbeitszeiten und speziellen Schulungen für diejenigen führt, die im Job bleiben.“ Ein Sprecher des Ministeriums für Arbeit und Renten sagte: „Das staatliche Rentenalter ist für jeden individuell und 2017 haben wir das zukünftige Rentenalter auf 68 angehoben, damit es jetzt und für zukünftige Generationen nachhaltig ist. Wir schaffen Möglichkeiten für Menschen aller Generationen mit Rekordbeschäftigung.“	Torys Plan, das gesetzliche Rentenalter in den nächsten 16 Jahren auf 75 Jahre anzuheben	false
c38d575e	Plastikstrohhalme und Rührstäbchen sowie Wattestäbchen mit Plastikstielen werden ab April in England verboten, zu verkaufen und zu verwenden, hat die Regierung bestätigt. Der Umzug, der seit mehr als einem Jahr geplant ist, soll den Müll und andere Umweltauswirkungen der fast 5 Milliarden Plastikstrohhalme, die derzeit jedes Jahr in England verwendet werden, erheblich reduzieren, zusammen mit mehr als 300 Millionen Plastikrührstäbchen und fast 2 Milliarden Wattestäbchen mit Kunststoffstiel. Eine große Anzahl dieser Gegenstände, insbesondere Wattestäbchen, werden in Toiletten gespült oder landen auf andere Weise im Müll – Untersuchungen haben kürzlich ergeben, dass Wasserstraßen in ganz Großbritannien von Plastik wimmeln und die Tierwelt gefährden. Alternativen sind verfügbar, darunter das Servieren von Getränken ohne Strohhalme oder Rührstäbchen, was vorzuziehen ist, oder die Verwendung von Papierstrohhalmen und biologisch abbaubaren Produkten anstelle von Plastikrührstäbchen und Wattestäbchen. Die einzigen Ausnahmen von der neuen Regel gelten für Menschen mit medizinischer Notwendigkeit oder Behinderung, für die auf Anfrage Plastikstrohhalme und andere Materialien erhältlich sind. Die EU bewegt sich auch dazu, Kunststoffe in verschiedenen Formen auslaufen zu lassen. Eine Regierungskonsultation ergab, dass mehr als 80 % der Befragten ein Verbot der Verteilung und des Verkaufs von Plastikstrohhalmen befürworteten, während neun von zehn Personen ein Verbot von Rührstäbchen für Getränke und eine ähnliche Anzahl ein Verbot von Wattestäbchen mit Plastikgriffen befürworteten. Registrierte Apotheken dürfen Plastikstrohhalme rezeptfrei oder online verkaufen, aber Restaurants, Kneipen und andere Catering-Einrichtungen dürfen Plastikstrohhalme nicht ausstellen oder automatisch bereitstellen. Michael Gove, Umweltminister, sagte: „Es sind dringende und entschlossene Maßnahmen erforderlich, um die Verschmutzung durch Plastik zu bekämpfen. Diese Gegenstände werden oft nur wenige Minuten benutzt, aber es dauert Hunderte von Jahren, bis sie zerfallen.“ Aktivisten begrüßten den Schritt der Regierung. Hugo Tagholm, Geschäftsführer von Surfers Against Sewage, das sich gegen die Plastikverschmutzung einsetzt, sagte: „Durch das Stoppen der Produktion und des Vertriebs dieser Einweg-Plastikbedrohungen wird verhindert, dass sie landesweit die Strände verschmutzen. Es ist ein wirklich positiver und mutiger Schritt in die richtige Richtung gegen die Plastikverschmutzung.“ Die voraussichtlich verbotenen Artikel seien jedoch nur ein Teil des Plastikproblems, sagte Emma Priestland, Aktivistin bei Friends of the Earth. „Diese drei Gegenstände sind nur ein Bruchteil der Einwegartikel, die für eine winzige Zeit verwendet werden, bevor sie die Umwelt für die kommenden Jahrhunderte verschmutzen“, sagte sie. „Letztendlich müssen die Hersteller die Verantwortung für die Plastikverschmutzung übernehmen, die durch alle ihre Produkte verursacht wird, egal ob es sich um Tüten, Ballons, Päckchen, Behälter oder anderes handelt. Deshalb setzen wir uns für Gesetze ein, um sinnloses Plastik flächendeckend einzuschränken.“	Plastikstrohhalme, Wattestäbchen und Rührstäbchen sollen in England verboten werden	false
7b9e930d	Der Konsum von Kokain in Großbritannien hat sich in sieben Jahren verdoppelt, da einer von 50 Londonern die Droge derzeit täglich schnupft. Eine Analyse des britischen Abwassers, die von forensischen Wissenschaftlern des King's College London durchgeführt wurde, hat ebenfalls bewiesen, dass die Reinheit der Klasse-A-Medikamente gestiegen ist und ein Rekordhoch erreicht hat. Tests der Droge im Abwasser zeigen, dass die Londoner jeden Tag fast 200.000 Dosen Kokain einnehmen, was etwa 700.000 Pfund ausmacht. Die Forschung ergab, dass einer von 50 Londonern das Medikament derzeit täglich einnimmt. Die Konzentrationen im Abwasser betragen 900 Milligramm pro 1.000 Einwohner pro Tag, was gegenüber 392 Milligramm pro 1.000 im Jahr 2011 gestiegen ist. Die durchschnittliche Kokaindosis durch Rauchen oder Schnupfen ist 40 Milligramm, was bedeutet, dass bei einer Bevölkerung von neun Millionen Menschen einer von 50 täglich das Medikament der Klasse A einnimmt. Die Untersuchung ergab auch, dass der Kokainkonsum in London an Wochentagen fast so hoch ist wie am Wochenende. Der Konsum von Kokain in London ist unter der Woche fast so hoch wie am Wochenende. Letztes Jahr berichtete die Global Drug Survey, dass die britische Hauptstadt eine der Städte der Welt ist, in der Kokain dank der schneller geliefert werden kann als Pizza Nutzung von Smartphones und verschlüsselten Nachrichtendiensten. London, Bristol, Barcelona, ​​Antwerpen, Zürich und Amsterdam gelten als die Top-Städte in Europa für den Konsum von Kokain. Eine Studie der Europäischen Beobachtungsstelle für Drogen und Drogensucht aus dem Jahr 2015 ergab, dass London die Stadt mit der höchsten Konzentration von Kokain im Abwasser in Europa war. Die Reinheit von Kokain steigt dank des erhöhten Angebots und der Produktion in Lateinamerika. Spuren der Droge wurden in Fischen und Garnelen in Suffolk gefunden. Eine im letzten Sommer veröffentlichte Studie ergab, dass gefährdete Aale aufgrund des Vorhandenseins von Drogen in britischen Gewässern „hyperaktiv“ werden könnten. Biologen der Universität Neapel Federico II fanden außerdem heraus, dass sich die Medikamente in den Gehirnen, Muskeln, Kiemen und der Haut der Tiere anreichern. Dr. Leon Barron, der die jüngste Analyse am King's College London leitete, sagte, dass die Reinheit von Kokain auch durch das gestiegene Angebot und die Produktion in Lateinamerika gestiegen sei. Jüngste Untersuchungen der National Crime Agency bestätigten, dass die Reinheit von Kokain auf einem „historisch hohen Niveau“ liegt. Cressida Dick, die Kommissarin der Metropolitan Police, sagte, Kokainkonsumenten schüren oft Bandengewalt und Messerstecherei. Reines Kokain wird auf der Straße für etwa 100 £ pro Gramm verkauft. Die Sicherstellungen von Kokain haben sich in fünf Hören verdreifacht, von 42,8 Tonnen in den Jahren 2013-14 auf 122,9 Tonnen in den Jahren 2017-18, berichtete The Telegraph. Dr. Barron sagte, dass durch die Behandlung von Abwasser das meiste Kokain aus dem Abwasser entfernt werden kann, bevor es in Flüsse zurückgeführt wird.

Registrieren Vielen Dank für Ihre Anmeldung Wir haben mehr Newsletter Zeig mir Siehe unsere Datenschutzerklärung Bahnfahrpreise sind in den letzten fünf Jahren fast dreimal so schnell gestiegen wie die Löhne, was laut einem neuen Bericht die Pendler ernsthaft in die Tasche gesteckt hat. Eine Studie der Kampagne „Action for Rail“ zeigte, dass Zeitkarten und andere regulierte Tarife seit 2010 um 25 % gestiegen sind, während die Durchschnittslöhne um 9 % gestiegen sind. Die Pläne der Regierung, die jährlichen Erhöhungen der regulierten Tarife zu begrenzen, werden die Steuerzahler in den nächsten fünf Jahren rund 700 Millionen Pfund kosten, aber größere Einsparungen könnten an die Fahrgäste weitergegeben werden, wenn der Zugverkehr vom öffentlichen Sektor betrieben würde, heißt es in dem Bericht. Zeitkarten könnten bis 2017 um 10 % billiger werden, wenn zur Ausschreibung anstehende Strecken an Organisationen des öffentlichen Sektors vergeben würden, hieß es. TUC-Generalsekretärin Frances O’Grady sagte: „Die Bahntarife sind in den letzten fünf Jahren in die Höhe geschossen und haben viele Pendler ernsthaft aus der Tasche gelassen. „Wenn die Minister wirklich bedrängten Pendlern helfen wollen, müssen sie Leistungen an den öffentlichen Sektor zurückgeben. Dies ist eine faire, nachhaltigere Option und würde es ermöglichen, viel größere Einsparungen an die Passagiere weiterzugeben. Die Einführung einer willkürlichen Obergrenze für Fahrpreise ist lediglich die Weitergabe der Rechnung an die Steuerzahler. Bild: PA „Die Regierung möchte, dass die Öffentlichkeit die Gewinne der Bahnunternehmen subventioniert und die Kosten der Fahrpreisobergrenze trägt.“ Aslef-Generalsekretär Mick Whelan sagte: „Einmal mehr entwerten diejenigen, die behaupten, dass sie Arbeit lohnenswert machen wollen, diese Aussage durch kontinuierliche, übermäßige und unangemessene Fahrpreiserhöhungen.“ Mick Cash, Vorsitzender der Rail, Maritime and Transport Union, sagte: „Während Zugunternehmen damit drohen, Wachen aus ihren Diensten zu werfen und Bahnhofsmitarbeiter zu streichen, die für die Sicherheit unerlässlich sind, und das Netz in ein Paradies für Kriminelle und Joobs verwandeln, melken sie das reisende Publikum für alles, was sie können, durch erpresserische Tarife. „Jeder Penny der Fahrpreisabzocke wird in Form von satten Unternehmensgewinnen aus dem System gesaugt, während wichtige Schienenwartungs- und Modernisierungsarbeiten aus Geldmangel auf Eis gelegt werden. „Das ist der Preis für zwei Jahrzehnte Eisenbahnprivatisierung, und das ganze faule Geschäft muss weggefegt und durch eine öffentliche Eisenbahn unter öffentlicher Kontrolle ersetzt werden.“ TSSA-Generalsekretär Manuel Cortes sagte: „Wir haben die teuersten Bahntarife in Europa und sie sind auf den beliebtesten Strecken seit der Privatisierung vor 20 Jahren um über 200 % gestiegen. „Wir sollten dem europäischen Beispiel folgen und eine öffentliche Eisenbahn zum Nutzen der reisenden Öffentlichkeit betreiben, nicht der privaten Eisenbahnunternehmen.“	Die Fahrpreise sind fünfmal schneller gestiegen als die Löhne, was den Ruf nach einer Renationalisierung laut werden lässt	true

d917caca	Das Tragen von zu lockeren Schuhen kann gefährlich sein, da sie die Art und Weise beeinträchtigen können, wie Sie Ihr Kraftfahrzeug steuern. Wenn das Wetter wärmer wird, holen wir Briten unsere Flip-Flops heraus. Aber diejenigen von uns, die sich dafür entscheiden, in ihren Sommerschuhen zu fahren, könnten in Schwierigkeiten geraten, wenn sie in einen Unfall verwickelt sind. Das Fahren in Flip-Flops ist nicht illegal, aber das Tragen von Flip-Flops kann zu einer Anzeige wegen fahrlässigen Fahrens führen, wenn sie Ihre Fahrsicherheit beeinträchtigen. Gemäß Regel 97 der Straßenverkehrsordnung wird den Fahrern empfohlen, Schuhe und Kleidung zu tragen, die Sie nicht daran hindern, die Bedienelemente richtig zu verwenden. Flip-Flops könnten von Ihrem Fuß rutschen, unter Pedalen eingeklemmt werden oder Sie daran hindern, die Pedale mit genug Kraft zu treten, um schnell zu bremsen, was dazu führen kann, dass Sie unberechenbar fahren oder sogar zu einem Unfall führen. Wenn Sie während einer gefährlichen Fahrt von der Polizei angehalten werden oder Ihre Schuhe ein Grund für einen Unfall sind, können Sie wegen unvorsichtigen Fahrens angeklagt werden. Die Geldstrafe für fahrlässiges Fahren wird mit einer Geldstrafe von 100 £ vor Ort und drei Strafpunkten auf Ihrem Führerschein geahndet. Wenn es sich um einen schwerwiegenderen Fall handelt oder er vor Gericht angefochten wird, kann die Anklage eine Geldstrafe von maximal 5.000 £, bis zu neun Strafpunkte und sogar ein gerichtlich verhängtes Fahrverbot nach sich ziehen. Eine Studie der Versicherungsmarke ingenie ergab zuvor, dass riesige 27 Prozent der Autofahrer diese Strafe riskieren könnten, wenn sie Flip-Flops hinter dem Lenkrad tragen. RAC-Richtlinien für geeignetes Schuhwerk für Autofahrer Laut RAC gibt es einige Richtlinien dafür, welches Schuhwerk zum Autofahren geeignet ist: Die Sohle sollte nicht dicker als 10 mm sein, aber die Sohle sollte nicht zu dünn oder weich sein. Sorgen Sie für genügend Halt, um zu verhindern, dass Ihr Fuß von den Pedalen rutscht. Sei nicht zu schwer. Knöchelbewegung nicht einschränken. Seien Sie eng genug, um zu vermeiden, dass versehentlich zwei Pedale gleichzeitig gedrückt werden. Neil Greig, IAM RoadSmart Director of Policy and Research, sagte gegenüber Sun Motors: „Bevor Sie losfahren, sollten Sie sicherstellen, dass Kleidung und Schuhe Sie nicht daran hindern, die Bedienelemente richtig zu verwenden. „Wenn Flip-Flops Sie daran hindern, die Kontrolle zu behalten, könnten Sie strafrechtlich verfolgt werden, da Sie gegen die Straßenverkehrsordnung 97 verstoßen. Unvorsichtiges Fahren wird hauptsächlich anhand der Auswirkungen beurteilt, die Ihr Fahren auf andere um Sie herum hat angehalten und festgestellt wird, dass Sie unzureichendes Schuhwerk haben, könnten Sie strafrechtlich verfolgt werden. Verursacht man doch einen Crash, dann kann das auch vor Gericht erschwerend wirken und zu einem etwas höheren Bußgeld oder einer längeren Sperre führen.“ Stellen Sie sicher, dass Sie in diesem Sommer die richtigen Schuhe tragen, um Auto zu fahren.	Seien Sie gewarnt, wenn Sie in Flip-Flops fahren, können Sie eine Geldstrafe von 5000 £, 9 Punkte und ein Verbot erhalten!	partially false
ff204eb9	Dringende Maßnahmen sind erforderlich, um „sterbende“ Hauptstraßen zu retten, da eine neue Labour-Analyse zeigt, dass 100.000 Arbeitsplätze im Einzelhandel in 3 Jahren verloren gegangen sind 3 Jahren verloren gegangen. Eine am Dienstag veröffentlichte neue Analyse von Labor of ONS-Zahlen hat ergeben, dass seit 2015 in Geschäften in ganz Großbritannien erstaunliche 100.000 Einzelhandelsjobs verloren gegangen sind, da die Reallöhne stagnierten und die verpfuschte Handhabung der Brexit-Verhandlungen das Vertrauen der Verbraucher und Unternehmen getroffen hat. Neben der Reform des Gewerbesteuersystems zur Entlastung traditioneller Einkaufsstraßen und Stadtzentren hat Rebecca Long Bailey, Schattenwirtschaftsministerin von Labour, die Regierung aufgefordert, Folgendes in Betracht zu ziehen: Einrichtung eines Registers von Vermietern leerstehender Geschäfte in jeder lokalen Behörde, um die Wiederinbetriebnahme von mit Brettern vernagelten Geschäften zu erleichtern Einleitung einer Untersuchung zu überhöhten Parkgebühren, die von Privatunternehmen erhoben werden, um die Vorteile der Förderung des kostenlosen Parkens in Stadtzentren zu untersuchen 2018 fielen zahlreiche große Marken in der Hauptstraße in die Verwaltung oder kündigten Geschäfte an Schließungen, darunter House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer, Mothercare und New Look. Untersuchungen des British Retail Consortium haben ergeben, dass fast ein Fünftel der britischen Einzelhändler plant, die Anzahl ihrer Mitarbeiter in den nächsten drei Monaten zu reduzieren. Ein Bericht von PwC und der Local Data Company ergab, dass im vergangenen Jahr 4.000 Geschäfte in der High Street eröffnet und 5.800 geschlossen wurden, was einem Nettoverlust von 1.800 entspricht. Derzeit stehen 11,35 % der Geschäfte leer, und die Local Data Company hat festgestellt, dass 52 % der ehemaligen BHS-Geschäfte zwei Jahre nach der endgültigen Schließung immer noch leer stehen. Untersuchungen von XLN aus dem vergangenen Jahr ergaben, dass neun von zehn Menschen häufiger Hauptstraßen besuchen würden, wenn kostenlose Parkplätze angeboten würden. Ein Drittel der Befragten nannten teure Parkplätze und das Fehlen kostenloser Parkplätze als ihre größten Frustrationen in Hauptstraßen. Das British Retail Consortium hat berichtet, dass 94 Prozent der Befragten sagen, dass sie das Gemeinschaftsgefühl ihrer Hauptstraße vermissen. Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Schattengeschäftssekretärin von Labour, sagte: „Unsere Hauptstraßen sterben, aber die Regierung unternimmt nichts dagegen. „Der Verlust von Giganten wie House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer und New Look aus den Stadtzentren im ganzen Land ist alarmierend. „Unsere Gemeinden, Hunderttausende von Arbeitsplätzen und unsere Wirtschaft, sowohl auf lokaler als auch auf nationaler Ebene, hängen von florierenden Einkaufsstraßen ab. Die Tories müssen schnell handeln, bevor wir zu einer Nation von Geisterstädten werden.“	Es sind dringende Maßnahmen erforderlich, um „sterbende“ Hauptstraßen zu retten, da eine neue Labour-Analyse zeigt, dass in drei Jahren 100.000 Arbeitsplätze im Einzelhandel verloren gegangen sind	false

Abgeordnete aus allen politischen Bereichen haben eine dringende Entscheidung darüber gefordert, ob der Flughafen Heathrow oder Gatwick erweitert werden soll. Die Verzögerung bei der Entscheidung darüber, wo eine neue Start- und Landebahn gebaut werden soll, kostet Großbritannien bis zu 6 Millionen Pfund pro Tag, heißt es in einem Bericht eines parteiübergreifenden Commons-Gremiums. Die britische Infrastrukturgruppe BIG unter der Leitung des konservativen Abgeordneten Grant Shapps forderte die neue Premierministerin Theresa May auf, sich zu beweisen und die Spekulationen zu beenden. Ihr Bericht mit dem Titel „Gate Now Closing“, der am Sonntag, den 24. Juli veröffentlicht wurde, fordert eine dringende und sofortige Entscheidung über den Ausbau des Hub-Flughafens. Der Bericht gibt nicht an, wo die Gruppe glaubt, dass eine neue Landebahn gebaut werden sollte, aber er argumentiert, dass die Unentschlossenheit eine schädliche Wirkung auf die britischen Unternehmen, die Wirtschaft und die Arbeitsplätze hat. „Kapazitätsproblem … verursacht erheblichen Schaden“ Das Kapazitätsproblem am derzeitigen Drehkreuz Heathrow fügt der Branche als Ganzes erheblichen Schaden zu, heißt es in dem Bericht. Es untergräbt das Vertrauen in das erklärte Ziel der Regierung, die Wirtschaft und unseren internationalen Handel anzukurbeln. Die Beweise wurden von der Airports Commission gesammelt. Jetzt muss eine Entscheidung getroffen werden, um den Mut der neuen Führung zu zeigen. Die Airports Commission empfahl im vergangenen Sommer den Bau einer dritten Landebahn in Heathrow über einer zweiten Landebahn in Gatwick. Immer noch kein Termin für die Ankündigung von Heathrow Die Entscheidung der Regierung wurde zunächst im vergangenen Jahr verschoben, als weitere Umweltstudien in Auftrag gegeben wurden, und dann im Juni nach dem Ergebnis des EU-Referendums. Das Verkehrsministerium hat nicht angegeben, wann eine Entscheidung nach der Ernennung von Chris Grayling zum neuen Verkehrsminister wahrscheinlich ist. Die Wahl von Theresa May zur Premierministerin und die Ernennung einer Reihe von Heathrow-Gegnern in ihr Kabinett haben dazu geführt, dass ein Buchmacher die Chancen auf Gatwicks Sieg im Kampf um eine neue Start- und Landebahn reduziert hat.

d8c5eecd	Lehrer, die den Beruf für andere Jobs aufgeben, müssen erhebliche Gehaltskürzungen hinnehmen, wie eine heute Abend veröffentlichte neue Studie zeigt. Die Untersuchung der NFER National Foundation for Educational Research untersuchte Lehrer, die in den letzten 14 Jahren für andere Berufe ausgeschieden sind, und stellte fest, dass ihre Gehälter im Vergleich zu denen, die im Unterricht blieben, im Durchschnitt um 10 Prozent gesunken sind. Es zeigt, dass einige Lehrer – die als Lehrassistenten abwanderten oder eine Stelle im öffentlichen Dienst antraten – Lohneinbußen von bis zu 30 Prozent hinnehmen mussten. Mary Bousted, Generalsekretärin der Association of Teachers and Dozenten, sagte, sie kenne einen Lehrer, der Busfahrer geworden sei, weil sie der Meinung seien, „alles sei dem Mangel an Lebensqualität vorzuziehen“, der mit dem Unterrichten einhergehe. „Die Tatsache, dass Lehrer schlechter bezahlte Jobs annehmen, spiegelt die Verzweiflung wider, die viele Lehrer empfinden, sagte sie. Die unerbittliche Natur der Arbeitsbelastung und des Drucks führt dazu, dass Lehrer einfach gehen. Sie sehen keine Möglichkeit, in der Lehre zu bleiben, und verlieren so ihren beruflichen Status und ihr Geld.“ Aber die NFER-Analyse der LFS-Daten der staatlichen Arbeitskräfteerhebung kann nur zeigen, wie sich die Gehälter der Lehrer kurzfristig verändert haben, da die LFS Einzelpersonen nur ein Jahr lang beobachtet. Soll ich bleiben oder gehen? Der Bericht kommt zu dem Schluss: „Die kurzfristigen Gehaltsvorteile eines Karrierewechsels können durch die Notwendigkeit eingeschränkt werden, den Wert für neue Arbeitgeber zu beweisen und Fähigkeiten für eine andere Karriere zu entwickeln. Die Aussicht auf eine längerfristige höhere Bezahlung mag für einige Lehrer, die den Unterricht aufgegeben haben, immer noch eine Motivation gewesen sein.“ Der Bericht fügte hinzu, dass es „möglich ist, dass Quereinsteiger aus anderen Berufen einen ähnlichen Lohnrückgang erleben, und dieses Phänomen ist wahrscheinlich nicht nur auf das Lehren zurückzuführen“. Laut der Studie nehmen mehr als die Hälfte von 51 Prozent der Lehrer, die das Lehramt verlassen, eine Stelle im Bildungssektor an, ausgenommen diejenigen, die in den Ruhestand gehen. Carole Willis, Geschäftsführerin von NFER, sagte: „Die Rekrutierung und Bindung von hochqualifizierten Lehrern ist ein Schlüsselproblem, dem sich das Bildungssystem in den nächsten fünf bis zehn Jahren stellen muss. Das Verständnis der Arten von Jobs, die ehemalige Lehrer annehmen, und ihrer zugrunde liegenden Motivationen ist entscheidend für die Formulierung einer angemessenen politischen Antwort.“ Das NFER analysierte über einen Zeitraum von 14 Jahren von 2001 bis 2015 eine Stichprobe von 6.896 Lehrern, darunter 936, die den Unterricht aufgegeben haben, und 774, die in den Unterricht eingetreten sind.

Laut einer Überprüfung der bestehenden Forschung zu Covid-19 und Kindern durch das Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health RCPCH spielen Kleinkinder keine bedeutende Rolle bei der Verbreitung des Virus und infizieren sich deutlich seltener als Erwachsene. Es arbeitete mit anderen Forschungsteams zusammen, um die Korrelation in Studien zur Übertragung von Kindern auf Erwachsene zu untersuchen, nachdem Beamte des öffentlichen Gesundheitswesens in der Schweiz heute erklärt hatten, dass unter 10-Jährige ihre Großeltern endlich wieder umarmen könnten, da sie kein Risiko für sie darstellen. In der Überprüfung durch das pädiatrische Forschungsprojekt „Don’t Forget the Bubbles“ heißt es: Insbesondere konnte sich die gemeinsame Kommission von China und der WHO nicht an Episoden während der Kontaktverfolgung erinnern, bei denen eine Übertragung von einem Kind auf einen Erwachsenen stattfand. Bild: REUTERS Aber die Überprüfung mahnte auch zur Vorsicht, da noch nicht bekannt ist, ob Kinder das Virus weitergegeben haben, insbesondere angesichts einer großen Anzahl asymptomatischer Fälle. Ein neunjähriger britischer Junge, der sich in den französischen Alpen mit dem Coronavirus infiziert hatte, gab es nicht weiter, obwohl er Kontakt zu mehr als 170 Personen an drei Schulen hatte. Dieser Fall wurde im Rahmen der Forschung untersucht. Dr. Alasdair Munro, der klinische Forschungsstipendiat für pädiatrische Infektionskrankheiten, der die Forschung leitete, sagte: Covid-19 scheint Kinder seltener und mit weniger Schwere zu betreffen, einschließlich häufiger asymptomatischer oder subklinischer Infektionen. Es gibt Hinweise auf eine kritische Erkrankung, aber sie ist selten. Die Rolle von Kindern bei der Übertragung ist unklar, aber es scheint wahrscheinlich, dass sie keine bedeutende Rolle spielen. Professor Russell Viner, der Präsident des RCPCH, sagte: „Wir sehen weltweit keine Beweise dafür, dass Kinder an der Verbreitung oder Übertragung des Virus beteiligt sind, aber wir haben nicht genügend Beweise. Prof. Viner fügte hinzu, dass es zu früh sei zu sagen, dass Kinder ihre Großeltern umarmen könnten, zumal die über 70-Jährigen am anfälligsten seien. Hinweis: Es wird nicht angenommen, dass Kinder eine bedeutende Rolle bei der Verbreitung des Coronavirus spielen. Eine frühere Version dieses Artikels gab fälschlicherweise an, dass eine Studie keine Fälle gefunden habe, in denen Kinder das Coronavirus an einen Erwachsenen weitergegeben hätten.

542709e6	Die Zahl der Studienbewerber ist seit letztem Jahr um 25.000 gesunken, wobei Experten den Brexit und Änderungen der Finanzierung für den Herbst verantwortlich machen. Insgesamt bewarben sich bis zum 30. Juni, dem letzten Bewerbungsschluss, 649.700 Menschen an einer Hochschule, rund 4 % weniger als zu diesem Zeitpunkt im Vorjahr. Eine Aufschlüsselung zeigt einen Rückgang der britischen Bewerber um 4 %, während die Zahl der EU-Studenten, die ein Studium an einer britischen Universität oder Hochschule planen, um 5 % zurückgegangen ist, berichtete die Press Association. Allerdings ist die Zahl der internationalen Studierenden aus Ländern außerhalb der EU um 2 % gestiegen. FatCamera via Getty Images Bewerbungen an britischen Universitäten sind seit 2016 um 25.000 zurückgegangen. Aber die Statistiken zeigen, dass der Anteil der 18-Jährigen in England, die sich an Universitäten bewerben, einen neuen Höchststand erreicht hat: 37,9 % planen ein Studium für einen Abschluss, gegenüber 37,2 % im Jahr 2016. Dame Julia Goodfellow, Präsidentin der Vizepräsidentin chancellors' group Universities UK, sagte: „Diese Zahlen bestätigen, was wir bereits von UCAS über die Anmeldezahlen für dieses Jahr wissen. Es gibt mehrere mögliche Gründe für den Rückgang der Zahlen. „Letztes Jahr war ein Rekordhoch bei den Bewerbungen, und Faktoren wie der Brexit und Änderungen in der Art und Weise, wie Abschlüsse in Krankenpflege, Hebammen und einigen anderen verwandten Gesundheitsberufen in England finanziert werden, könnten sich ebenfalls auswirken. „Auch die Zahl der 18- und 19-Jährigen in der britischen Bevölkerung ist seit 2010 zurückgegangen. „Diese Gruppe macht über die Hälfte aller britischen Universitätsbewerber aus. Die Bewerbungsquote dieser Altersgruppe ist jedoch auf Rekordniveau, was die anhaltende Nachfrage nach Studiengängen unterstreicht.“ Sie fügte hinzu: „Wir wissen, dass es eine Reihe von Problemen zu lösen gilt. Es ist wichtig, den europäischen Bewerbern weiterhin zu vermitteln, dass sie willkommen sind und unser Bildungssystem bereichern. „Auch der Rückgang der berufsbegleitenden und volljährigen Studienanfänger muss angegangen werden. „Wir erkennen auch die Besorgnis über die Gesamtkosten des Studiums an. Jede Analyse muss die Wartungskosten und den Zinssatz für die Darlehen abdecken.“ Die Zahlen kommen inmitten einer wachsenden Debatte über die Zukunft der Studiengebühren, die derzeit bei maximal 9.250 £ pro Jahr liegen, ausgelöst durch ein Versprechen der Labour-Generalwahl, die Gebühren abzuschaffen.

Der Labour-Führer schloss sich dem Schattenkanzler John McDonnell, den SNP-Abgeordneten, dem Vorsitzenden der Lib Dem, Tim Farron, und dem ehemaligen stellvertretenden Premierminister Nick Clegg an, um den Antrag an seinem ersten Tag im Parlament zu unterstützen. Bisher haben 28 Abgeordnete den von den Lib Dems ausgearbeiteten Antrag unterzeichnet, um gesetzliche Änderungen der Invaliditätsrente PIP für persönliche Unabhängigkeit zu stoppen. Schattenarbeits- und Rentenministerin Debbie Abrahams, die den Vereinten Nationen die Umstrukturierung des PIP gemeldet hat, hat den Antrag gegen das Gesetz ebenfalls unterzeichnet. Die Minister haben Notstandsgesetze ausgearbeitet, um zwei Tribunale zu bekämpfen, die besagten, dass PIP – das die Lebenshaltungskosten von Menschen mit Behinderungen finanziert – ausgeweitet werden sollte. Die Tribunale sagten, Menschen, die unter überwältigender psychischer Belastung leiden, wenn sie das Haus verlassen, sollten mehr Geld bekommen. Dazu gehören Menschen mit Autismus, Demenz, Schizophrenie, posttraumatischem Stress und Depressionen. Die Tory-Abgeordnete Heidi Allen warnte die Minister, die Tribunale zu ehren, und die Bow Group, eine Denkfabrik der Tory, sagte, dass das Ignorieren der Gerichte der Konservativen Partei einen schlechten Ruf verschafft. Die Regierung weigerte sich jedoch, einen Rückzieher zu machen – die Behauptung, dies zu tun, würde die Steuerzahler bis 2022 3,7 Milliarden Pfund kosten. Und der Tory-Abgeordnete Freeman löste Empörung aus, indem er behauptete, die bizarren Urteile hätten einfach Menschen geholfen, die zu Hause Pillen einnehmen und unter Angstzuständen leiden. Trotz der Unterstützung für den Antrag steht er vor einem Kampf um die Annahme - und das letzte Mal, dass ein ähnlicher Antrag erfolgreich war, war 1979. Die rechtliche Umwälzung erfolgt über ein Statutory Instrument, das einer negativen Entscheidung unterliegt, einem obskuren Stück Gesetz, das nur möglich ist blockiert werden, wenn Abgeordnete dagegen beten. Das Gesetz trat am 23. Februar sofort in Kraft, kann aber unter dem bizarren System von Westminster annulliert werden, wenn das Unterhaus innerhalb von 40 Tagen und Nächten für die Unterstützung eines Gebets stimmt. Labour und die Lib Dems reichten heute beide ein formelles Gebet bei den Commons-Behörden ein, und die Lib Dems – die zuerst eintrafen – wurden zur Debatte ausgewählt. Die Unterschrift des Oppositionsführers erhöht die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass ein Gebet für eine Debatte in Betracht gezogen wird. Aber es ist ihnen immer noch nicht immer garantiert, dass sie Zeit im Unterhaus haben, auch wenn sie breite Unterstützung finden.

cf0ae5c6	Der durchschnittliche verurteilte Kriminelle, der eine kurze Haftstrafe verbüßt, hat zuvor mehr als 55 Straftaten begangen, wie Zahlen der Polizei zeigen. Einige Wiederholungstäter werden den Daten zufolge zum ersten Mal ins Gefängnis geschickt, nachdem sie 100 oder mehr verschiedene Verbrechen begangen haben. Die Zahlen, die diesen Monat von den Ministern herausgerutscht sind, deuten darauf hin, dass die meisten Kriminellen, die ins Gefängnis kommen, in der Vergangenheit bereits wegen mehrerer Straftaten verurteilt wurden. Der i-Politik-Newsletter hat den Lärm durchbrochen E-Mail-Adresse ist ungültig Vielen Dank für Ihre Anmeldung! Entschuldigung, es gab ein Problem mit Ihrem Abonnement. Konservative Abgeordnete behaupteten, die Enthüllung beweise, dass das Justizsystem zu weich gegenüber Straftätern sei, während Reformer der Regierung vorwarfen, Kriminelle nicht zu rehabilitieren und sich zu sehr auf Gefängnisse zu verlassen. Geschichte der Straftaten Als Antwort auf eine schriftliche Frage des Tory-Hinterbänklers Philip Davies sagte das Justizministerium, dass der durchschnittliche Mann, der zu einer Gefängnisstrafe von weniger als sechs Monaten verurteilt wurde, 56,6 Straftaten begangen habe, die zu einer Verurteilung oder Verwarnung geführt hätten, während Frauen in derselben Position dies getan hätten 60.4 Vorstrafen. Die Zahlen zeigten auch, dass es im vergangenen Jahr einen Täter gab, der 93 verschiedene Verbrechen begangen hatte, bevor er zum ersten Mal ins Gefängnis kam. 2018 waren mindestens zwei Erstgefangene zuvor wegen mehr als 100 Straftaten verurteilt worden. Die Daten stammen vom Police National Computer, der alle Polizeikräfte im Vereinigten Königreich abdeckt. Herr Davies, der Abgeordnete von Shipley, sagte gegenüber i: „Diese Zahlen zerstören absolut die liberal-linke Orthodoxie des Strafjustizsystems. Bevor Menschen zu einer kurzen Haftstrafe verurteilt werden, erhalten sie eine Gemeinschaftsstrafe nach der anderen, und dies ist ein Beweis dafür, dass Gemeinschaftsstrafen nicht funktionieren.“ Die Abgeordnete der Liberaldemokraten, Layla Moran, argumentierte jedoch, dass die Daten „ein systemisches Versagen aufdecken, diejenigen zu rehabilitieren, die wegen Verbrechen verurteilt wurden, und eine erneute Straftat zu verhindern“. Sie fügte hinzu: „Es ist zutiefst heuchlerisch von der Regierung, hart über Kriminalität zu sprechen und auf Polizeizahlen zu pochen, während sie gleichzeitig nicht in Rehabilitations- und Präventionsinitiativen investiert.“ Andrew Neilson von der Howard League for Penal Reform fügte hinzu: „Menschen für kurze Zeit ins Gefängnis zu schicken, ist besonders ineffektiv, wie diese Zahlen zeigen. Die meisten Menschen, die kurze Haftstrafen verbüßen, haben dies schon einmal getan und werden dies mit ziemlicher Sicherheit wieder tun. Es funktioniert einfach nicht.“ Der Justizminister reagierte nicht auf eine Bitte um Stellungnahme.

Von HM Revenue and Customs veröffentlichte Daten zeigen, dass die Zahl der Kinder in Familien mit niedrigem Einkommen zwischen 2013 und 2014 von 2,5 Millionen auf 2,75 Millionen gestiegen ist. Dies bedeutet, dass der Gesamtanteil der Kinder in Haushalten mit Problemen jetzt 20 % erreicht hat – oder eins von fünf alle Kinder. Wütende Wohltätigkeitsaktivisten und Labour-Abgeordnete warfen den Tories vor, die schutzbedürftigsten Kinder der Gesellschaft nicht zu schützen. Imran Hussain, Politikdirektor der Child Poverty Action Group, sagte: „Die Kinderarmutszahlen sind der beste Maßstab, den wir haben, um festzustellen, ob wir wirklich ‚alle zusammen‘ sind. Bild: Getty „Diese düsteren Zahlen machen deutlich, dass immer mehr Kinder in Armut zurückgelassen werden und die Kindheit und die Lebenschancen verpassen, die andere Kinder für selbstverständlich halten. „Bei zwei Dritteln armer Kinder in berufstätigen Familien ist es skandalös, dass die Regierung nicht versucht, die verheerenden Kürzungen für berufstätige Familien im Rahmen der neuen Universalkreditleistung rückgängig zu machen.“ Debbie Abrahams, Schattenarbeits- und Rentenministerin der Labour Party, fügte hinzu: „Das ist es zutiefst schockierend zu sehen, dass 250.000 weitere Kinder in Haushalten mit niedrigem Einkommen leben, einschließlich Familien, die arbeiten. „Unsere Kinder sollten nicht den Preis für die gescheiterte Sparpolitik der Tories zahlen. „Unter Labour haben wir große Fortschritte gemacht, um die Kinderarmut zu beenden. Die warmen Worte dieser Regierung werden das Elend, das ihre Politik anrichtet, nicht länger verschleiern.“ Bild: Getty Der HMRC-Bericht klassifiziert Kinder in Familien mit niedrigem Einkommen als diejenigen, die entweder Leistungen bei Arbeitslosigkeit oder Steuergutschriften mit einem Einkommen von weniger als 60 % des nationalen Durchschnitts erhalten. Die HMRC sagte, die Ergebnisse seien darauf zurückzuführen, dass die Einkommen der ärmeren Menschen nicht mit den Gehaltserhöhungen derjenigen Schritt halten konnten – bestand jedoch darauf, dass ihre tatsächlichen Einkommen möglicherweise nicht in allen Fällen gesunken sind. „Die Regierung setzt sich dafür ein, ein Land zu schaffen, das für alle funktioniert – nicht nur für die wenigen Privilegierten“, sagte ein Regierungssprecher. „Dazu gehört auch, Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, um den am stärksten Benachteiligten zu helfen, indem die Ursachen der Armut und nicht nur die Symptome bekämpft werden.“	Die Zahl der in Armut lebenden Kinder ist unter der Tory-Regierung um 250.000 gestiegen	partially false
8febabd8	Es war der Tod von Sheku Bayoh im Jahr 2015, der mich zum Handeln anspornte: In dem Versuch, der anhaltenden Geschichte der weltweiten Polizeibrutalität schwarze britische Stimmen hinzuzufügen, habe ich mich mit dem Filmemacher Troy James Aidoo zusammengetan, um den Dokumentarfilm 1500 And Counting zu erstellen . Wir haben mit Mitgliedern der Bayoh-Familie und Organisationen zusammengearbeitet, um das kriminelle Verhalten von Beamten ins Rampenlicht zu rücken und zu versuchen, die Briten aus ihrem derzeitigen Zustand der Selbstgefälligkeit zu reißen. Wenn wir dem Staat nicht vertrauen können, uns fair zu überwachen, dann sind wir alle wandelnde Ziele. Immer wieder sehen wir ein ähnliches Muster in den Geschichten von schwarzen Opfern von Polizeibrutalität: Sie sind oft verletzlich, meist psychisch krank, werden von mehreren Beamten festgenommen und mit brutaler Gewalt festgenommen. Die Entstehung von 1500 And Counting veranlasste mich zu der Frage, was sich seit den 1980er Jahren wirklich verändert hat – einer Zeit, als Skinheads die Straßen beherrschten und Einwanderer terrorisierten und die jetzt abgeschafften Sus-Gesetze es Polizeibeamten erlaubten, schwarze Männer und Jungen zu durchsuchen, zu durchsuchen und zu brutalisieren sie ohne besonderen Grund. Obwohl der Race Relations Act ursprünglich 1965 in Großbritannien eingeführt wurde, um Rassendiskriminierung zu verbieten, und in den 90er Jahren auf die Polizei ausgedehnt wurde, hat sich nicht viel verbessert. Wenn wir irgendeinen Bereich des britischen Lebens untersuchen, werden wir erhebliche rassische Ungleichheiten feststellen. Die Arbeitslosenquote für ethnische Minderheiten in Großbritannien beträgt 11,3 %, mehr als doppelt so viel wie die der Weißen mit 5,5 %. Deprimierenderweise sind Schwarze fast dreimal so häufig arbeitslos wie alle anderen in Großbritannien, wobei 38 % der jungen schwarzen Männer derzeit arbeitslos sind, verglichen mit 17,8 % der jungen weißen Männer. Das Gesundheitswesen ist ein weiterer Bereich, in dem große Ungleichheit herrscht: Schwarze Menschen werden mit 44 % höherer Wahrscheinlichkeit nach dem Mental Health Act inhaftiert als ihre weißen Kollegen. Schwarze Menschen sind in britischen Gefängnissen überproportional vertreten als in den USA. Der Anteil schwarzer Menschen in Gefängnissen in Großbritannien beträgt fast das Siebenfache ihres Bevölkerungsanteils, während in den USA der Anteil schwarzer Gefangener viermal so hoch ist wie ihr Bevölkerungsanteil . Und erschreckenderweise haben Polizisten routinemäßige Verhaftungen durchgeführt, um das DNA-Profil von drei Vierteln junger schwarzer britischer Männer im Alter zwischen 18 und 35 Jahren zu sammeln.

7212bc8a	Die Labour Party hat der Regierung vorgeworfen, Patienten im Stich gelassen zu haben, nachdem die Bundeskanzlerin eine Kürzung der täglichen Ausgaben im Ministerium für Gesundheit und Soziales um 30 Milliarden Pfund begraben hatte, da die Wartelisten ein Rekordhoch erreichten. Der Vorsitzende der Labour Party, Keir Starmer, wird heute Morgen am Donnerstag ein Krankenhaus in Derby besuchen, da Haushaltsdokumente eine geplante Kürzung der täglichen Ausgaben im Ministerium für Gesundheit und Soziales um 30,1 Milliarden Pfund ab April dieses Jahres enthüllten. Eine neue, von der Labour Party veröffentlichte Analyse zeigt Folgendes: Die Zahl der Patienten, die länger als 18 Wochen auf eine Behandlung warten, ist in den letzten zehn Jahren um über 500 % gestiegen. Fast eine Viertelmillion Menschen warten mehr als ein Jahr auf eine Behandlung. Derzeit stehen schätzungsweise 4,59 Millionen Menschen auf der Warteliste für eine Behandlung – die höchste jemals verzeichnete Zahl. Schon vor dem Ausbruch der Pandemie war die Zahl der Personen, die länger als 18 Wochen warteten, in den letzten neun Jahren auf über 720.000 im Dezember 2019 gestiegen. Nur 68 % der Patienten auf der Warteliste haben 18 Wochen oder weniger gewartet – das gesetzliche Ziel dass 92 % der Patienten innerhalb von 18 Wochen nach der Überweisung eine Behandlung erhalten müssen, wurde seit 2016 nicht erreicht. Die Zahlen beinhalten Patienten, die auf Hüft- und Kniegelenkersatz und Kataraktentfernung warten, neben vielen anderen Eingriffen und Behandlungen, die für die Lebensqualität der Menschen von entscheidender Bedeutung sind. Die Ausgaben des NHS England werden von 147,7 Mrd. £ in diesem Jahr auf 139,1 Mrd. £ im nächsten Jahr sinken, trotz der laufenden Kosten für den NHS durch Covid und des enormen Rückstands an Fällen und Wartelisten, die sich während der Krise aufgebaut haben. Im November schätzte die Health Foundation, dass die Beseitigung der Rückstände und die Reduzierung der Wartezeiten in den nächsten drei Jahren rund 2 Milliarden Pfund pro Jahr kosten würden. Jonathan Ashworth MP, Shadow Health and Social Care Secretary, kommentierte die Ergebnisse wie folgt: „Die Bundeskanzlerin lässt Patienten, unseren NHS und seine Mitarbeiter im Stich, indem sie während einer Pandemie die Dienstleistungen an vorderster Front einschränkt. „Da die Listen bereits auf einem Rekordhoch sind, bedeutet dies, dass Patienten mit Schmerzen noch länger auf eine lebenswichtige Behandlung warten müssen. „Der gestrige Haushalt hat die Risse zugekleistert, anstatt die Grundlagen unseres Landes wieder aufzubauen.“	Bundeskanzler lässt Patienten mit seiner Kürzung des NHS um 30 Milliarden Pfund im Stich, da die Wartelisten ein Rekordhoch erreichten	false
48026a71	Andy Murray servierte John Inverdale ein Ass, nachdem der BBC-Moderator einen Ausrutscher über Tennisspielerinnen gemacht hatte. Frisch von seinem Triumph in Rio wurde Murray von Inverdale dafür gelobt, dass er anscheinend der erste Mensch war, der zwei olympische Goldmedaillen im Tennis gewann. Aber der Einzelchampion erkannte schnell, dass die Moderatorin die Existenz der Williams-Schwestern vergaß und sagte ihm: Venus und Serena haben jeweils vier gewonnen.“ Es kam, nachdem Murray den Argentinier Juan Martin Del Potro besiegt hatte, um sein zweites Gold nach einem zermürbenden vierstündigen Spiel am Sonntagabend zu gewinnen. Sein Triumph machte ihn zum ersten Mann, der bei den Olympischen Spielen hintereinander Goldmedaillen im Einzel gewann. John Inverdales jüngster Fehler passierte während eines Interviews mit Andy Murray/Getty Londons Bürgermeister Sadiq Khan nach dem Spiel, der einen Clip twitterte, in dem Murray seine Medaille erhielt, machte ebenfalls den Fehler. Er schrieb: „Zeit der Nationalhymne für @Andy_Murray – der erste Spieler ÜBERHAUPT, der 2 x #GOLD bei den #Olympischen Spielen #Tennis #Rio2016 gewann.“ Tennisfans lobten Murray in den sozialen Medien schnell für den Witz. Chronik von Andy Murrays größten Tennissiegen Gillian Laird twitterte: Gut gemacht @andy_murray – sowohl für das Gold als auch dafür, John Inverdale an seine Stelle zu setzen. Ein anderer Benutzer namens Phi schrieb: #AndyMurray sollte eine weitere Medaille bekommen, weil er John Inverdale an die Existenz von Frauen erinnert hat. Julie Bull schrieb: Gut zu sehen, dass sich jemand für die Mädchen einsetzt, denn es wird niemals John Inverdale sein. Es ist der jüngste in einer Reihe von Fehlern von Inverdale, der zwei On-Air-Spats mit der Ruderlegende und seinem Kollegen Sir Steve Redgrave hatte. Sir Steve stürmte mitten in einer Live-Übertragung davon, nachdem er sich offensichtlich darüber geärgert hatte, dass er nicht die Möglichkeit hatte, zu sprechen. Das Paar hatte eine weitere Pleite, als Inverdale einen neuseeländischen Ruderer für ein Gespräch anhielt, nur damit Redgrave ihn unterbrach und das Interview beendete, indem er sagte, das neuseeländische Fernsehen müsse zuerst mit Mahe Drysdale, dem Olympiasieger im Einzelzweier, sprechen. Bei einem weiteren Fehler auf dem Bildschirm bei den Olympischen Spielen am Mittwoch scherzte ein Kommentator darüber, dass er nicht zwei Männer küssen sehen wollte.

0b9f0803	Laut führenden Kinderärzten sollte es in England verboten werden, Fast-Food-Läden in einem Umkreis von 400 Metern um Schulen zu eröffnen. Das Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health forderte die Regierung auf, die Maßnahme als Teil ihrer aktualisierten Strategie zur Fettleibigkeit bei Kindern einzuführen, die diesen Sommer veröffentlicht wurde. Der Bürgermeister von London, Sadiq Khan, hat ein Verbot für den Bau neuer Fast-Food-Läden in einer solchen Entfernung vorgeschlagen, und das College forderte, dies auf ganz Großbritannien auszudehnen. Prof. Russell Viner, der Präsident des Colleges, sagte, die Minister sollten „einen Vertrauensvorschuss wagen“ und Maßnahmen einführen, die es den Räten erleichtern, Junk Food von Studenten fernzuhalten. In einem Interview mit dem Daily Telegraph sagte er: „Kinder kommen hungrig aus der Schule und finden sich umgeben von billigen Hühnchenläden, Chipsläden und anderen Arten von Junk Food. Das war vor 20 oder 30 Jahren einfach nicht der Fall. „Menschen neigen dazu, das zu essen, was vor ihnen liegt, und wir müssen es Kindern erleichtern, die richtigen Entscheidungen zu treffen.“ Viner sagte, die lokalen Behörden bräuchten mehr Befugnisse, um die Einführung solcher Verbote zu erleichtern. Eine Reihe von Räten hat diese Maßnahmen eingeführt, andere sagten, sie seien mit zu viel Bürokratie konfrontiert. Daten zeigen, dass fast ein Drittel der Kinder im Alter von zwei bis 15 Jahren übergewichtig oder fettleibig sind und jüngere Generationen früher fettleibig werden und länger fettleibig bleiben. Im Mai wird das Commons Health and Social Care Committee Anhörungen für eine Untersuchung zur Fettleibigkeit bei Kindern eröffnen und Bereiche untersuchen, in denen es Maßnahmen ergreifen sollte. Das College schlug auch vor, dass es ein nationales Programm zum Wiegen und Messen von Kindern von der Geburt bis zu ihren Teenagerjahren geben sollte. Sie forderte, Hausärzte darin zu schulen, wie man mit Eltern über zugenommene Kinder spricht. „Wir müssen darauf vorbereitet sein, schwierige Gespräche zu führen und jeden Kontakt [mit Gesundheitsdiensten] im Kampf gegen Fettleibigkeit zählen zu lassen“, sagte Viner. Er fügte hinzu: „Wir müssen einen Vertrauenssprung machen, um gegenwärtige und zukünftige Generationen zu schützen.“	Die Minister drängten darauf, die Eröffnung von Fast-Food-Läden in der Nähe von Schulen zu verbieten	false
7ffcc643	Das Gremium, das im Auftrag des Parlaments die öffentlichen Ausgaben prüft, forderte einen besseren Schutz für gefährdete Spieler. Die Regierung sollte sich mit der Finanzierung der Regulierungsbehörde, der Glücksspielkommission, befassen. Die Kommission sagte, sie stimme zu, dass mehr getan werden müsse. Der NAO-Bericht besagt, dass lizenziertes Glücksspiel – mit Ausnahme der National Lottery – in den letzten zehn Jahren um 57 % zugenommen hat. Ein Großteil dieses Anstiegs sei auf eine Zunahme lizenzierter Online-Glücksspiele zurückzuführen, die im November 2014 stark zunahmen, als eine Änderung der Vorschriften bedeutete, dass alle Online-Glücksspiele lizenziert werden mussten, einschließlich Firmen mit Sitz im Ausland. Spielsüchtige für Website William Hill bestraft Die Leute, die am wahrscheinlichsten ein Spielproblem haben Glücksspielverbindungen mit Fußball sind „zu weit gegangen“ Glücksspiel mit Kreditkarten wird verboten Die Glücksspielkommission ist eine kleine Regulierungsbehörde in einer riesigen und sich schnell entwickelnden Branche. Während die Kommission Verbesserungen vorgenommen hat, hinkt die Glücksspielregulierung der Branche hinterher, sagte Gareth Davies, der Leiter des NAO. Die Kommission schätzt, dass 1,8 Millionen Menschen Risikospieler und 395.000 Problemspieler sind, darunter 55.000 Kinder. Spielsucht kann zu psychischen Problemen und schweren finanziellen Schwierigkeiten führen. Ein Sprecher der Glücksspielkommission sagte: Wir stimmen der Einschätzung des Berichts zu, dass wir vor der großen Herausforderung stehen, eine dynamische und sich entwickelnde Branche zu regulieren. Sie bespreche bereits Vorschläge zur Reform ihres Finanzierungsmodells mit dem Ministerium für Kultur, Medien und Sport, fügte sie hinzu. Die Kommission erhielt 2018-19 19 Millionen Pfund an Finanzmitteln, die fast ausschließlich aus den den Betreibern in Rechnung gestellten Lizenzgebühren stammten, heißt es im Bericht des NAO. Die Organisation hat nicht die Macht, die von ihr erhobenen Lizenzgebühren zu erhöhen, was es schwierig macht, in neue Fähigkeiten zu investieren, um auf Entwicklungen in der Branche zu reagieren, sagte der Wachhund. Die Gebühren werden alle vier Jahre durch Sekundärgesetzgebung von der Regierung festgelegt.	Gefährdete Spieler „brauchen besseren Schutz“	partially false

Alarmierende Zahlen … gemeldete Sexualverbrechen in Klassen verdreifachen sich in nur vier Jahren erreichte 1.955 mit durchschnittlich zehn beteiligten Schulen pro Tag. Zu den mutmaßlichen Straftaten gehörten Vergewaltigung, Kinderprostitution und Pflege. Insgesamt wurden in den vier Jahren etwa 4.643 Sexualdelikte an Schulen angezeigt. Sexuelle Belästigung und Gewalt in Schulen sind an der Tagesordnung Plan International UK, die Lucy Russell Children’s Charity von Plan International UK, die die Zahlen sammelte, bezeichnete die Ergebnisse als alarmierend und forderte die Regierung auf, Beziehungserziehung obligatorisch zu machen, um aggressives Sexualverhalten zu bekämpfen. Lucy Russell von der Wohltätigkeitsorganisation sagte: „Wir sind sehr besorgt über diese Ergebnisse. „Leider sind wir nicht wirklich schockiert, weil wir von Mädchen gehört haben, dass sexuelle Belästigung und Gewalt in Schulen an der Tagesordnung sind. Es ist etwas, worüber sie sich wirklich Sorgen machen.“ Frau Russell sagte, Belästigung in Schulen werde oft als Scherz angesehen, bei dem Mädchen „von erwartet werden, dass sie sich damit abfinden“. Aber sie warnte: „Jedes Mal, wenn du mit etwas davonkommst, bedeutet das, dass du die nächste Stufe ausprobieren kannst.“ Schulen müssen den Schülern mitteilen, dass unerwünschte Berührungen und sexuelle Beschimpfungen Belästigung sind, sagte sie. 66 Prozent der mutmaßlichen Opfer waren Frauen, 94 Prozent der gemeldeten Straftaten wurden von Männern begangen. Zu den gemeldeten Fällen in England gehörten ein fünfjähriges Mädchen, das einen Jungen und einen fünfjährigen Jungen angegriffen haben soll, die der sexuellen Aktivität mit einem Mädchen beschuldigt wurden.

e91bcd49	Die Zahl und der Anteil der NHS-Krankenhauspatienten in England, die mehr als 18 Wochen auf den Beginn der Behandlung warten, sind auf den höchsten Stand seit fast sieben Jahren gestiegen, wie offizielle Statistiken zeigen. Im Februar begannen fast 40.000 zugelassene Patienten nicht innerhalb von 18 Wochen nach der Überweisung mit einer beratergeführten Behandlung, und mehr als 13.000 warteten länger als 26 Wochen. Das Ziel ist, dass 90 % innerhalb von 18 Wochen eine Behandlung erhalten, aber nur 87 % haben dies getan. Die einzige schlechtere Leistung – sowohl in Prozent als auch in absoluten Zahlen – seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen im März 2008 war im April desselben Jahres, als 86,7 % innerhalb von 18 Wochen mit der Behandlung begannen. Das bedeutete, dass etwas mehr als 40.000 über diesen Zeitraum hinaus warten mussten. Die Zahlen zeigen, dass die mittlere Wartezeit im Februar einen Rekordwert von 10 Wochen erreichte, gegenüber 8,4 Wochen zum Zeitpunkt der letzten Wahl. Der Schattengesundheitsminister Andy Burnham beschuldigte die Tories, ihre Versprechen gegenüber dem NHS gebrochen zu haben. „David Cameron hat versprochen, die Wartezeiten gering zu halten, aber die heutigen Zahlen zeigen, dass sein Plan für den NHS gescheitert ist“, sagte er. „Seine Reorganisation hat den NHS an den Punkt gebracht, an dem er die Wartezeitziele nicht mehr einhalten kann, obwohl er Listen auf einem Rekordtief geerbt hat.“ Zum Zeitpunkt der letzten Wahl begannen 92,9 % der Krankenhauspatienten innerhalb von 18 Wochen nach der Überweisung mit einer fachärztlichen Behandlung, was bedeutet, dass etwas mehr als 20.000 über diesen Zeitraum hinaus warten mussten. Der NHS soll auch sicherstellen, dass 95 % der ambulanten Patienten innerhalb von 18 Wochen nach der Überweisung mit der Behandlung beginnen, aber im Februar waren es 94,7 %, der niedrigste Wert seit Juni 2008. Fast 45.000 warteten noch nach 18 Wochen, eine geringere Zahl als in beiden Fällen Oktober und November letzten Jahres. Ein Sprecher von NHS England sagte: „Im Februar hat der NHS weitere Fortschritte bei der Reduzierung langer Wartezeiten gemacht, wobei die Zahl der Patienten, die über ein Jahr gewartet haben, von über 5.000 vor drei Jahren auf jetzt Hunderte gesunken ist, und die durchschnittliche Wartezeit für ein Operation dauert nur 10 Wochen.“	Die Wartezeit im NHS-Krankenhaus ist die schlechteste seit sieben Jahren	partially false
e7d84dfa	Die Regierung gibt jährlich rund 50 Milliarden Pfund aus, um Menschen mit Behinderungen und gesundheitlichen Problemen zu unterstützen. Ein Teil dieser Unterstützung kommt durch Personal Independence Payment PIP . Es wurde als Ersatz für das veraltete Wohngeld für Behinderte eingeführt und hilft bei den zusätzlichen Kosten, die oft mit einer Behinderung einhergehen, wie z. B. zusätzliche Transportkosten oder Hilfe beim Kochen. Das PIP-Assessment soll mehr Unterstützung auf diejenigen konzentrieren, die wahrscheinlich einen höheren Bedarf und höhere Kosten im Zusammenhang mit ihrer Behinderung haben. Beispielsweise benötigen Anspruchsberechtigte, die zu Hause eine Therapie wie Dialyse oder Sauerstoff benötigen, wahrscheinlich mehr Unterstützung als jemand, der Hilfe bei der Einnahme von Medikamenten benötigt. Ebenso benötigen Menschen, die aufgrund einer Seh- oder kognitiven Beeinträchtigung eine Reise nicht durchführen können, wahrscheinlich mehr Unterstützung als jemand, der während einer Reise unter psychischen Belastungen leidet, beispielsweise aufgrund einer sozialen Phobie oder Angst. Jüngste Gerichtsurteile haben die Bewertungskriterien für PIP anders ausgelegt als ursprünglich beabsichtigt. Die Regierung nimmt nun Änderungen vor, um die Kriterien zu präzisieren, das ursprüngliche Ziel der Politik wiederherzustellen und sicherzustellen, dass die Unterstützung den Bedürftigsten zugute kommt. Dies ist keine Richtlinienänderung und wird nicht dazu führen, dass Antragsteller eine Kürzung des PIP-Betrags erfahren, der zuvor vom Ministerium für Arbeit und Renten DWP gewährt wurde. Zweck ist die Wiederherstellung des ursprünglichen, durch die Rechtsprechung erweiterten Nutzenzwecks. Die Ausgaben für Invaliditätsleistungen sind seit 2010 real um mehr als 3 Milliarden £ gestiegen und werden bis 2020 jedes Jahr höher bleiben als 2010. Wenn die ursprüngliche Absicht der Richtlinie nicht wiederhergestellt würde, hätte dies zu erheblichen ungeplanten Erhöhungen der Öffentlichkeit geführt Ausgaben von insgesamt 3,7 Milliarden £ zwischen 2016 und 2017 und 2021 bis 2022.

Einer von vier Menschen wird ein psychisches Gesundheitsproblem haben, und die Kosten psychischer Erkrankungen für die Wirtschaft, den NHS und die Gesellschaft insgesamt belaufen sich auf 105 Milliarden Pfund pro Jahr. Diese Ankündigung wird die bereits erzielten Fortschritte beschleunigen, einschließlich: Erhöhung der Mittel, die seit 2010 jedes Jahr in die psychische Gesundheit gesteckt werden, was dem NHS im vergangenen Jahr eine Rekordsumme von 11,7 Milliarden Pfund einbrachte, Einführung der allerersten Zugangs- und Wartezeitstandards für psychische Gesundheit, d.h Menschen erhalten die Pflege, die sie brauchen, wenn sie sie brauchen, indem sie 1,4 Milliarden Pfund investieren, um die psychiatrischen Dienste für junge Menschen umzugestalten Alistair Burt, Minister für psychische Gesundheit, sagte:	Neue Investitionen in psychiatrische Dienste	other
534b565c	Der NHS wird bei allen Handelsverhandlungen zwischen den USA und Großbritannien vom Tisch sein, sagte die Regierung am Montag, als sie sich begrenzte Ambitionen für ein zukünftiges Handelsabkommen mit Washington setzte. Die Regierung veröffentlichte ihr Verhandlungsmandat und schien sich dem öffentlichen Druck zu beugen, die US-Landwirtschaftsmethoden nicht zu akzeptieren, obwohl Handelsexperten sagten, die britische Position lasse einen kleinen Spielraum bei der Änderung der landwirtschaftlichen Standards. Der NHS wird nicht auf dem Tisch liegen. Der Preis, den der NHS für Medikamente zahlt, wird nicht auf dem Tisch liegen. Die Dienstleistungen, die der NHS erbringt, werden nicht auf dem Tisch liegen, heißt es in dem 184-seitigen Mandat, das die Befürchtungen zerstreut, dass ein US-Handelsabkommen die britischen Arzneimittelpreise in die Höhe treiben würde. David Henig, Direktor des UK Trade Policy Project am Thinktank European Centre for International Political Economy, sagte, die Verhandlungsziele für ein US-Handelsabkommen seien relativ bescheiden und schienen darauf ausgelegt zu sein, das Kästchen eines Abkommens anzukreuzen, anstatt erhebliche Gewinne zu erzielen. Sie spiegeln die Bedenken der Regierung wider, dass ein umfassendes Abkommen die wahrscheinlichen politischen Probleme von Landwirten und Umweltaktivisten unter anderem wirtschaftlich nicht wert ist, sagte Herr Henig. Die Regierung sagte, sie schätzt, dass die Vorteile der Unterzeichnung eines Handelsabkommens zwischen den USA und Großbritannien von 0,16 Prozent des zusätzlichen BIP in 15 Jahren am oberen Ende bis zu 0,07 Prozent des BIP reichen würden, wenn das Abkommen den Handel weniger als erhofft liberalisiert. Die Ziele zwischen den USA und dem Vereinigten Königreich wurden in London veröffentlicht, als ein Team von mehr als 100 britischen Handelsunterhändlern Gespräche in Brüssel eröffnete, um zu versuchen, vor Ablauf der Frist am 31. Dezember eine Einigung über die künftigen Beziehungen zwischen der EU und dem Vereinigten Königreich zu erzielen. Das Vereinigte Königreich strebt eine Einigung im kanadischen Stil mit der EU an, was nach Schätzungen der Finanzanalyse dazu führen wird, dass die britische Wirtschaft um 4,9 Prozent weniger wächst, als es sonst der Fall gewesen wäre.

069cf853	Von Edward Spalton. Dieser Artikel erschien erstmals am 10. Oktober im Derby Evening Telegraph Herr Cameron hat natürlich recht, dass die Europäische Menschenrechtskonvention EMRK zu einer Parodie ihrer ursprünglichen lobenswerten Absichten erweitert wurde. Es kostete einmal viele tausend Pfund aus öffentlichen Mitteln, um eine Anwältin, Cherie Blair, zu bezahlen, um einen Fall im Namen eines Schulmädchens zu übernehmen, das ihre Schuluniform nicht tragen wollte. Solange er uns in der EU hält, kann Herr Cameron uns nicht davon abhalten, der EMRK zu gehorchen. Im Jahr 2011 schrieb die EU-Kommission als separates Gremium: „Die Achtung der Grundrechte, wie sie von der Europäischen Menschenrechtskonvention garantiert werden, ist eine ausdrückliche Verpflichtung für die Union gemäß Artikel 6 3 des Vertrags über die Europäische Union … d. h. des Vertrags von Lissabon. …. Der Gerichtshof der EU hat entschieden, dass die Konvention von besonderer Bedeutung für die Bestimmung der von den Mitgliedstaaten zu respektierenden Grundrechte ist.“ Wenn Herr Cameron also vor dem Europäischen Gerichtshof für Menschenrechte davonläuft, wird ihn der eigene Gerichtshof der EU zurückziehen und ihn zum Gehorsam zwingen. Das steht im Vertrag von Lissabon, der obersten Verfassung unseres Landes, der die Magna Charta, Queen, Lords and Commons außer Kraft setzt, solange wir in der EU bleiben. Es ist derselbe Vertrag, zu dem uns „Cast Iron Cameron“ ein Referendum versprochen hat.	Nur wenn wir die EU verlassen, entkommen wir der Menschenrechtsgesetzgebung	true
282ff13b	Mehr als 11.000 Strafverfahren in England und Wales mussten im vergangenen Jahr abgebrochen werden, weil Zeugen abgezogen oder nicht vor Gericht erschienen sind, sagte ein Wachhund. Die Zahlen wurden von der HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate veröffentlicht. Angeklagte können in solchen Fällen freigesprochen oder ihre Prozesse verschoben werden. Der Wachhund sagte jedoch, dass zu viele Zeugen von Fällen häuslicher Gewalt vorgeladen wurden, was die Gefahr berge, Opfer zu entfremden, die bereit waren, auszusagen. Bei Nichterscheinen droht ein Haftbefehl gegen den Zeugen.

Laut einer Studie des Nuffield Trust war die Zahl der Mädchen im Teenageralter im Alter von 15 bis 19 Jahren, die 2013/14 mit Verdacht auf eine Alkoholvergiftung in die Notaufnahme gingen, um fast 38 % höher als bei Jungen in der gleichen Altersgruppe. Insgesamt gab es im vergangenen Jahr gegenüber 2008/9 einen Anstieg der A&E-Teilnahmequoten um 104 %, wie die Studie zeigte. Rebecca Barry von ITV News berichtet: In allen anderen Altersgruppen waren die A&E-Besuche in Zusammenhang mit Alkohol bei Männern höher.

c1af4bf0	To read an annotated version of this article, complete with interviews with scientists and links to further reading, click here.  I. ‘Doomsday’  Peering beyond scientific reticence.  It is, I promise, worse than you think. If your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible, even within the lifetime of a teenager today. And yet the swelling seas — and the cities they will drown — have so dominated the picture of global warming, and so overwhelmed our capacity for climate panic, that they have occluded our perception of other threats, many much closer at hand. Rising oceans are bad, in fact very bad; but fleeing the coastline will not be enough.  Indeed, absent a significant adjustment to how billions of humans conduct their lives, parts of the Earth will likely become close to uninhabitable, and other parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this century.  Even when we train our eyes on climate change, we are unable to comprehend its scope. This past winter, a string of days 60 and 70 degrees warmer than normal baked the North Pole, melting the permafrost that encased Norway’s Svalbard seed vault — a global food bank nicknamed “Doomsday,” designed to ensure that our agriculture survives any catastrophe, and which appeared to have been flooded by climate change less than ten years after being built.  Related Stories The Uninhabitable Earth, Annotated Edition  The Doomsday vault is fine, for now: The structure has been secured and the seeds are safe. But treating the episode as a parable of impending flooding missed the more important news. Until recently, permafrost was not a major concern of climate scientists, because, as the name suggests, it was soil that stayed permanently frozen. But Arctic permafrost contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon, more than twice as much as is currently suspended in the Earth’s atmosphere. When it thaws and is released, that carbon may evaporate as methane, which is 34 times as powerful a greenhouse-gas warming blanket as carbon dioxide when judged on the timescale of a century; when judged on the timescale of two decades, it is 86 times as powerful. In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.  Maybe you know that already — there are alarming stories in the news every day, like those, last month, that seemed to suggest satellite data showed the globe warming since 1998 more than twice as fast as scientists had thought (in fact, the underlying story was considerably less alarming than the headlines). Or the news from Antarctica this past May, when a crack in an ice shelf grew 11 miles in six days, then kept going; the break now has just three miles to go — by the time you read this, it may already have met the open water, where it will drop into the sea one of the biggest icebergs ever, a process known poetically as “calving.”  But no matter how well-informed you are, you are surely not alarmed enough. Over the past decades, our culture has gone apocalyptic with zombie movies and Mad Max dystopias, perhaps the collective result of displaced climate anxiety, and yet when it comes to contemplating real-world warming dangers, we suffer from an incredible failure of imagination. The reasons for that are many: the timid language of scientific probabilities, which the climatologist James Hansen once called “scientific reticence” in a paper chastising scientists for editing their own observations so conscientiously that they failed to communicate how dire the threat really was; the fact that the country is dominated by a group of technocrats who believe any problem can be solved and an opposing culture that doesn’t even see warming as a problem worth addressing; the way that climate denialism has made scientists even more cautious in offering speculative warnings; the simple speed of change and, also, its slowness, such that we are only seeing effects now of warming from decades past; our uncertainty about uncertainty, which the climate writer Naomi Oreskes in particular has suggested stops us from preparing as though anything worse than a median outcome were even possible; the way we assume climate change will hit hardest elsewhere, not everywhere; the smallness (two degrees) and largeness (1.8 trillion tons) and abstractness (400 parts per million) of the numbers; the discomfort of considering a problem that is very difficult, if not impossible, to solve; the altogether incomprehensible scale of that problem, which amounts to the prospect of our own annihilation; simple fear. But aversion arising from fear is a form of denial, too.  In between scientific reticence and science fiction is science itself. This article is the result of dozens of interviews and exchanges with climatologists and researchers in related fields and reflects hundreds of scientific papers on the subject of climate change. What follows is not a series of predictions of what will happen — that will be determined in large part by the much-less-certain science of human response. Instead, it is a portrait of our best understanding of where the planet is heading absent aggressive action. It is unlikely that all of these warming scenarios will be fully realized, largely because the devastation along the way will shake our complacency. But those scenarios, and not the present climate, are the baseline. In fact, they are our schedule.  The present tense of climate change — the destruction we’ve already baked into our future — is horrifying enough. Most people talk as if Miami and Bangladesh still have a chance of surviving; most of the scientists I spoke with assume we’ll lose them within the century, even if we stop burning fossil fuel in the next decade. Two degrees of warming used to be considered the threshold of catastrophe: tens of millions of climate refugees unleashed upon an unprepared world. Now two degrees is our goal, per the Paris climate accords, and experts give us only slim odds of hitting it. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issues serial reports, often called the “gold standard” of climate research; the most recent one projects us to hit four degrees of warming by the beginning of the next century, should we stay the present course. But that’s just a median projection. The upper end of the probability curve runs as high as eight degrees — and the authors still haven’t figured out how to deal with that permafrost melt. The IPCC reports also don’t fully account for the albedo effect (less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight, hence more warming); more cloud cover (which traps heat); or the dieback of forests and other flora (which extract carbon from the atmosphere). Each of these promises to accelerate warming, and the history of the planet shows that temperature can shift as much as five degrees Celsius within thirteen years. The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer, Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World, his new history of the planet’s major extinction events, the oceans were hundreds of feet higher.*  The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now, each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock, and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into. Unless you are a teenager, you probably read in your high-school textbooks that these extinctions were the result of asteroids. In fact, all but the one that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas. The most notorious was 252 million years ago; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees, accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic, and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead. We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably faster rate; by most estimates, at least ten times faster. The rate is accelerating. This is what Stephen Hawking had in mind when he said, this spring, that the species needs to colonize other planets in the next century to survive, and what drove Elon Musk, last month, to unveil his plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years. These are nonspecialists, of course, and probably as inclined to irrational panic as you or I. But the many sober-minded scientists I interviewed over the past several months — the most credentialed and tenured in the field, few of them inclined to alarmism and many advisers to the IPCC who nevertheless criticize its conservatism — have quietly reached an apocalyptic conclusion, too: No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster.  Over the past few decades, the term “Anthropocene” has climbed out of academic discourse and into the popular imagination — a name given to the geologic era we live in now, and a way to signal that it is a new era, defined on the wall chart of deep history by human intervention. One problem with the term is that it implies a conquest of nature (and even echoes the biblical “dominion”). And however sanguine you might be about the proposition that we have already ravaged the natural world, which we surely have, it is another thing entirely to consider the possibility that we have only provoked it, engineering first in ignorance and then in denial a climate system that will now go to war with us for many centuries, perhaps until it destroys us. That is what Wallace Smith Broecker, the avuncular oceanographer who coined the term “global warming,” means when he calls the planet an “angry beast.” You could also go with “war machine.” Each day we arm it more.  II. Heat Death  The bahraining of New York.  In the sugar­cane region of El Salvador, as much as one-fifth of the population has chronic kidney disease, the presumed result of dehydration from working the fields they were able to comfortably harvest as recently as two decades ago. Photo: Heartless Machine  Humans, like all mammals, are heat engines; surviving means having to continually cool off, like panting dogs. For that, the temperature needs to be low enough for the air to act as a kind of refrigerant, drawing heat off the skin so the engine can keep pumping. At seven degrees of warming, that would become impossible for large portions of the planet’s equatorial band, and especially the tropics, where humidity adds to the problem; in the jungles of Costa Rica, for instance, where humidity routinely tops 90 percent, simply moving around outside when it’s over 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be lethal. And the effect would be fast: Within a few hours, a human body would be cooked to death from both inside and out.  Climate-change skeptics point out that the planet has warmed and cooled many times before, but the climate window that has allowed for human life is very narrow, even by the standards of planetary history. At 11 or 12 degrees of warming, more than half the world’s population, as distributed today, would die of direct heat. Things almost certainly won’t get that hot this century, though models of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually. This century, and especially in the tropics, the pain points will pinch much more quickly even than an increase of seven degrees. The key factor is something called wet-bulb temperature, which is a term of measurement as home-laboratory-kit as it sounds: the heat registered on a thermometer wrapped in a damp sock as it’s swung around in the air (since the moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in dry air, this single number reflects both heat and humidity). At present, most regions reach a wet-bulb maximum of 26 or 27 degrees Celsius; the true red line for habitability is 35 degrees. What is called heat stress comes much sooner.  Related Stories Michael Oppenheimer: Only 10 Percent Chance We Meet Paris Targets  Actually, we’re about there already. Since 1980, the planet has experienced a 50-fold increase in the number of places experiencing dangerous or extreme heat; a bigger increase is to come. The five warmest summers in Europe since 1500 have all occurred since 2002, and soon, the IPCC warns, simply being outdoors that time of year will be unhealthy for much of the globe. Even if we meet the Paris goals of two degrees warming, cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become close to uninhabitable, annually encountering deadly heat waves like those that crippled them in 2015. At four degrees, the deadly European heat wave of 2003, which killed as many as 2,000 people a day, will be a normal summer. At six, according to an assessment focused only on effects within the U.S. from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the lower Mississippi Valley, and everybody in the country east of the Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone, anywhere, in the world today. As Joseph Romm has put it in his authoritative primer Climate Change: What Everyone Needs to Know, heat stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain, one of the planet’s hottest spots, and the temperature in Bahrain “would induce hyperthermia in even sleeping humans.” The high-end IPCC estimate, remember, is two degrees warmer still. By the end of the century, the World Bank has estimated, the coolest months in tropical South America, Africa, and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century. Air-conditioning can help but will ultimately only add to the carbon problem; plus, the climate-controlled malls of the Arab emirates aside, it is not remotely plausible to wholesale air-condition all the hottest parts of the world, many of them also the poorest. And indeed, the crisis will be most dramatic across the Middle East and Persian Gulf, where in 2015 the heat index registered temperatures as high as 163 degrees Fahrenheit. As soon as several decades from now, the hajj will become physically impossible for the 2 million Muslims who make the pilgrimage each year.  It is not just the hajj, and it is not just Mecca; heat is already killing us. In the sugarcane region of El Salvador, as much as one-fifth of the population has chronic kidney disease, including over a quarter of the men, the presumed result of dehydration from working the fields they were able to comfortably harvest as recently as two decades ago. With dialysis, which is expensive, those with kidney failure can expect to live five years; without it, life expectancy is in the weeks. Of course, heat stress promises to pummel us in places other than our kidneys, too. As I type that sentence, in the California desert in mid-June, it is 121 degrees outside my door. It is not a record high.  III. The End of Food  Praying for cornfields in the tundra.  Climates differ and plants vary, but the basic rule for staple cereal crops grown at optimal temperature is that for every degree of warming, yields decline by 10 percent. Some estimates run as high as 15 or even 17 percent. Which means that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them. And proteins are worse: It takes 16 calories of grain to produce just a single calorie of hamburger meat, butchered from a cow that spent its life polluting the climate with methane farts.  Pollyannaish plant physiologists will point out that the cereal-crop math applies only to those regions already at peak growing temperature, and they are right — theoretically, a warmer climate will make it easier to grow corn in Greenland. But as the pathbreaking work by Rosamond Naylor and David Battisti has shown, the tropics are already too hot to efficiently grow grain, and those places where grain is produced today are already at optimal growing temperature — which means even a small warming will push them down the slope of declining productivity. And you can’t easily move croplands north a few hundred miles, because yields in places like remote Canada and Russia are limited by the quality of soil there; it takes many centuries for the planet to produce optimally fertile dirt.  Drought might be an even bigger problem than heat, with some of the world’s most arable land turning quickly to desert. Precipitation is notoriously hard to model, yet predictions for later this century are basically unanimous: unprecedented droughts nearly everywhere food is today produced. By 2080, without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American dust bowl ever was. The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest of the Middle East; some of the most densely populated parts of Australia, Africa, and South America; and the breadbasket regions of China. None of these places, which today supply much of the world’s food, will be reliable sources of any. As for the original dust bowl: The droughts in the American plains and Southwest would not just be worse than in the 1930s, a 2015 NASA study predicted, but worse than any droughts in a thousand years — and that includes those that struck between 1100 and 1300, which “dried up all the rivers East of the Sierra Nevada mountains” and may have been responsible for the death of the Anasazi civilization.  Remember, we do not live in a world without hunger as it is. Far from it: Most estimates put the number of undernourished at 800 million globally. In case you haven’t heard, this spring has already brought an unprecedented quadruple famine to Africa and the Middle East; the U.N. has warned that separate starvation events in Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria, and Yemen could kill 20 million this year alone.  IV. Climate Plagues  What happens when the bubonic ice melts?  Rock, in the right spot, is a record of planetary history, eras as long as millions of years flattened by the forces of geological time into strata with amplitudes of just inches, or just an inch, or even less. Ice works that way, too, as a climate ledger, but it is also frozen history, some of which can be reanimated when unfrozen. There are now, trapped in Arctic ice, diseases that have not circulated in the air for millions of years — in some cases, since before humans were around to encounter them. Which means our immune systems would have no idea how to fight back when those prehistoric plagues emerge from the ice.  The Arctic also stores terrifying bugs from more recent times. In Alaska, already, researchers have discovered remnants of the 1918 flu that infected as many as 500 million and killed as many as 100 million — about 5 percent of the world’s population and almost six times as many as had died in the world war for which the pandemic served as a kind of gruesome capstone. As the BBC reported in May, scientists suspect smallpox and the bubonic plague are trapped in Siberian ice, too — an abridged history of devastating human sickness, left out like egg salad in the Arctic sun.  Experts caution that many of these organisms won’t actually survive the thaw and point to the fastidious lab conditions under which they have already reanimated several of them — the 32,000-year-old “extremophile” bacteria revived in 2005, an 8 million-year-old bug brought back to life in 2007, the 3.5 million–year–old one a Russian scientist self-injected just out of curiosity — to suggest that those are necessary conditions for the return of such ancient plagues. But already last year, a boy was killed and 20 others infected by anthrax released when retreating permafrost exposed the frozen carcass of a reindeer killed by the bacteria at least 75 years earlier; 2,000 present-day reindeer were infected, too, carrying and spreading the disease beyond the tundra.  What concerns epidemiologists more than ancient diseases are existing scourges relocated, rewired, or even re-evolved by warming. The first effect is geographical. Before the early-modern period, when adventuring sailboats accelerated the mixing of peoples and their bugs, human provinciality was a guard against pandemic. Today, even with globalization and the enormous intermingling of human populations, our ecosystems are mostly stable, and this functions as another limit, but global warming will scramble those ecosystems and help disease trespass those limits as surely as Cortés did. You don’t worry much about dengue or malaria if you are living in Maine or France. But as the tropics creep northward and mosquitoes migrate with them, you will. You didn’t much worry about Zika a couple of years ago, either.  As it happens, Zika may also be a good model of the second worrying effect — disease mutation. One reason you hadn’t heard about Zika until recently is that it had been trapped in Uganda; another is that it did not, until recently, appear to cause birth defects. Scientists still don’t entirely understand what happened, or what they missed. But there are things we do know for sure about how climate affects some diseases: Malaria, for instance, thrives in hotter regions not just because the mosquitoes that carry it do, too, but because for every degree increase in temperature, the parasite reproduces ten times faster. Which is one reason that the World Bank estimates that by 2050, 5.2 billion people will be reckoning with it.  V. Unbreathable Air  A rolling death smog that suffocates millions.  By the end of the century, the coolest months in tropical South America, Africa, and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century. Photo: Heartless Machine  Our lungs need oxygen, but that is only a fraction of what we breathe. The fraction of carbon dioxide is growing: It just crossed 400 parts per million, and high-end estimates extrapolating from current trends suggest it will hit 1,000 ppm by 2100. At that concentration, compared to the air we breathe now, human cognitive ability declines by 21 percent.  Other stuff in the hotter air is even scarier, with small increases in pollution capable of shortening life spans by ten years. The warmer the planet gets, the more ozone forms, and by mid-century, Americans will likely suffer a 70 percent increase in unhealthy ozone smog, the National Center for Atmospheric Research has projected. By 2090, as many as 2 billion people globally will be breathing air above the WHO “safe” level; one paper last month showed that, among other effects, a pregnant mother’s exposure to ozone raises the child’s risk of autism (as much as tenfold, combined with other environmental factors). Which does make you think again about the autism epidemic in West Hollywood.  Already, more than 10,000 people die each day from the small particles emitted from fossil-fuel burning; each year, 339,000 people die from wildfire smoke, in part because climate change has extended forest-fire season (in the U.S., it’s increased by 78 days since 1970). By 2050, according to the U.S. Forest Service, wildfires will be twice as destructive as they are today; in some places, the area burned could grow fivefold. What worries people even more is the effect that would have on emissions, especially when the fires ravage forests arising out of peat. Peatland fires in Indonesia in 1997, for instance, added to the global CO2 release by up to 40 percent, and more burning only means more warming only means more burning. There is also the terrifying possibility that rain forests like the Amazon, which in 2010 suffered its second “hundred-year drought” in the space of five years, could dry out enough to become vulnerable to these kinds of devastating, rolling forest fires — which would not only expel enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere but also shrink the size of the forest. That is especially bad because the Amazon alone provides 20 percent of our oxygen.  Then there are the more familiar forms of pollution. In 2013, melting Arctic ice remodeled Asian weather patterns, depriving industrial China of the natural ventilation systems it had come to depend on, which blanketed much of the country’s north in an unbreathable smog. Literally unbreathable. A metric called the Air Quality Index categorizes the risks and tops out at the 301-to-500 range, warning of “serious aggravation of heart or lung disease and premature mortality in persons with cardiopulmonary disease and the elderly” and, for all others, “serious risk of respiratory effects”; at that level, “everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion.” The Chinese “airpocalypse” of 2013 peaked at what would have been an Air Quality Index of over 800. That year, smog was responsible for a third of all deaths in the country.  VI. Perpetual War  The violence baked into heat.  Climatologists are very careful when talking about Syria. They want you to know that while climate change did produce a drought that contributed to civil war, it is not exactly fair to saythat the conflict is the result of warming; next door, for instance, Lebanon suffered the same crop failures. But researchers like Marshall Burke and Solomon Hsiang have managed to quantify some of the non-obvious relationships between temperature and violence: For every half-degree of warming, they say, societies will see between a 10 and 20 percent increase in the likelihood of armed conflict. In climate science, nothing is simple, but the arithmetic is harrowing: A planet five degrees warmer would have at least half again as many wars as we do today. Overall, social conflict could more than double this century.  This is one reason that, as nearly every climate scientist I spoke to pointed out, the U.S. military is obsessed with climate change: The drowning of all American Navy bases by sea-level rise is trouble enough, but being the world’s policeman is quite a bit harder when the crime rate doubles. Of course, it’s not just Syria where climate has contributed to conflict. Some speculate that the elevated level of strife across the Middle East over the past generation reflects the pressures of global warming — a hypothesis all the more cruel considering that warming began accelerating when the industrialized world extracted and then burned the region’s oil.  What accounts for the relationship between climate and conflict? Some of it comes down to agriculture and economics; a lot has to do with forced migration, already at a record high, with at least 65 million displaced people wandering the planet right now. But there is also the simple fact of individual irritability. Heat increases municipal crime rates, and swearing on social media, and the likelihood that a major-league pitcher, coming to the mound after his teammate has been hit by a pitch, will hit an opposing batter in retaliation. And the arrival of air-conditioning in the developed world, in the middle of the past century, did little to solve the problem of the summer crime wave.  VII. Permanent Economic Collapse  Dismal capitalism in a half-poorer world.  The murmuring mantra of global neoliberalism, which prevailed between the end of the Cold War and the onset of the Great Recession, is that economic growth would save us from anything and everything.  But in the aftermath of the 2008 crash, a growing number of historians studying what they call “fossil capitalism” have begun to suggest that the entire history of swift economic growth, which began somewhat suddenly in the 18th century, is not the result of innovation or trade or the dynamics of global capitalism but simply our discovery of fossil fuels and all their raw power — a onetime injection of new “value” into a system that had previously been characterized by global subsistence living. Before fossil fuels, nobody lived better than their parents or grandparents or ancestors from 500 years before, except in the immediate aftermath of a great plague like the Black Death, which allowed the lucky survivors to gobble up the resources liberated by mass graves. After we’ve burned all the fossil fuels, these scholars suggest, perhaps we will return to a “steady state” global economy. Of course, that onetime injection has a devastating long-term cost: climate change.  The most exciting research on the economics of warming has also come from Hsiang and his colleagues, who are not historians of fossil capitalism but who offer some very bleak analysis of their own: Every degree Celsius of warming costs, on average, 1.2 percent of GDP (an enormous number, considering we count growth in the low single digits as “strong”). This is the sterling work in the field, and their median projection is for a 23 percent loss in per capita earning globally by the end of this century (resulting from changes in agriculture, crime, storms, energy, mortality, and labor).  Tracing the shape of the probability curve is even scarier: There is a 12 percent chance that climate change will reduce global output by more than 50 percent by 2100, they say, and a 51 percent chance that it lowers per capita GDP by 20 percent or more by then, unless emissions decline. By comparison, the Great Recession lowered global GDP by about 6 percent, in a onetime shock; Hsiang and his colleagues estimate a one-in-eight chance of an ongoing and irreversible effect by the end of the century that is eight times worse.  The scale of that economic devastation is hard to comprehend, but you can start by imagining what the world would look like today with an economy half as big, which would produce only half as much value, generating only half as much to offer the workers of the world. It makes the grounding of flights out of heat-stricken Phoenix last month seem like pathetically small economic potatoes. And, among other things, it makes the idea of postponing government action on reducing emissions and relying solely on growth and technology to solve the problem an absurd business calculation.  Every round-trip ticket on flights from New York to London, keep in mind, costs the Arctic three more square meters of ice.  VIII. Poisoned Oceans  Sulfide burps off the skeleton coast.  That the sea will become a killer is a given. Barring a radical reduction of emissions, we will see at least four feet of sea-level rise and possibly ten by the end of the century. A third of the world’s major cities are on the coast, not to mention its power plants, ports, navy bases, farmlands, fisheries, river deltas, marshlands, and rice-paddy empires, and even those above ten feet will flood much more easily, and much more regularly, if the water gets that high. At least 600 million people live within ten meters of sea level today.  But the drowning of those homelands is just the start. At present, more than a third of the world’s carbon is sucked up by the oceans — thank God, or else we’d have that much more warming already. But the result is what’s called “ocean acidification,” which, on its own, may add a half a degree to warming this century. It is also already burning through the planet’s water basins — you may remember these as the place where life arose in the first place. You have probably heard of “coral bleaching” — that is, coral dying — which is very bad news, because reefs support as much as a quarter of all marine life and supply food for half a billion people. Ocean acidification will fry fish populations directly, too, though scientists aren’t yet sure how to predict the effects on the stuff we haul out of the ocean to eat; they do know that in acid waters, oysters and mussels will struggle to grow their shells, and that when the pH of human blood drops as much as the oceans’ pH has over the past generation, it induces seizures, comas, and sudden death.  That isn’t all that ocean acidification can do. Carbon absorption can initiate a feedback loop in which underoxygenated waters breed different kinds of microbes that turn the water still more “anoxic,” first in deep ocean “dead zones,” then gradually up toward the surface. There, the small fish die out, unable to breathe, which means oxygen-eating bacteria thrive, and the feedback loop doubles back. This process, in which dead zones grow like cancers, choking off marine life and wiping out fisheries, is already quite advanced in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and just off Namibia, where hydrogen sulfide is bubbling out of the sea along a thousand-mile stretch of land known as the “Skeleton Coast.” The name originally referred to the detritus of the whaling industry, but today it’s more apt than ever. Hydrogen sulfide is so toxic that evolution has trained us to recognize the tiniest, safest traces of it, which is why our noses are so exquisitely skilled at registering flatulence. Hydrogen sulfide is also the thing that finally did us in that time 97 percent of all life on Earth died, once all the feedback loops had been triggered and the circulating jet streams of a warmed ocean ground to a halt — it’s the planet’s preferred gas for a natural holocaust. Gradually, the ocean’s dead zones spread, killing off marine species that had dominated the oceans for hundreds of millions of years, and the gas the inert waters gave off into the atmosphere poisoned everything on land. Plants, too. It was millions of years before the oceans recovered.  IX. The Great Filter  Our present eeriness cannot last.  So why can’t we see it? In his recent book-length essay The Great Derangement, the Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh wonders why global warming and natural disaster haven’t become major subjects of contemporary fiction — why we don’t seem able to imagine climate catastrophe, and why we haven’t yet had a spate of novels in the genre he basically imagines into half-existence and names “the environmental uncanny.” “Consider, for example, the stories that congeal around questions like, ‘Where were you when the Berlin Wall fell?’ or ‘Where were you on 9/11?’ ” he writes. “Will it ever be possible to ask, in the same vein, ‘Where were you at 400 ppm?’ or ‘Where were you when the Larsen B ice shelf broke up?’ ” His answer: Probably not, because the dilemmas and dramas of climate change are simply incompatible with the kinds of stories we tell ourselves about ourselves, especially in novels, which tend to emphasize the journey of an individual conscience rather than the poisonous miasma of social fate.  Surely this blindness will not last — the world we are about to inhabit will not permit it. In a six-degree-warmer world, the Earth’s ecosystem will boil with so many natural disasters that we will just start calling them “weather”: a constant swarm of out-of-control typhoons and tornadoes and floods and droughts, the planet assaulted regularly with climate events that not so long ago destroyed whole civilizations. The strongest hurricanes will come more often, and we’ll have to invent new categories with which to describe them; tornadoes will grow longer and wider and strike much more frequently, and hail rocks will quadruple in size. Humans used to watch the weather to prophesy the future; going forward, we will see in its wrath the vengeance of the past. Early naturalists talked often about “deep time” — the perception they had, contemplating the grandeur of this valley or that rock basin, of the profound slowness of nature. What lies in store for us is more like what the Victorian anthropologists identified as “dreamtime,” or “everywhen”: the semi-mythical experience, described by Aboriginal Australians, of encountering, in the present moment, an out-of-time past, when ancestors, heroes, and demigods crowded an epic stage. You can find it already watching footage of an iceberg collapsing into the sea — a feeling of history happening all at once.  It is. Many people perceive climate change as a sort of moral and economic debt, accumulated since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and now come due after several centuries — a helpful perspective, in a way, since it is the carbon-burning processes that began in 18th-century England that lit the fuse of everything that followed. But more than half of the carbon humanity has exhaled into the atmosphere in its entire history has been emitted in just the past three decades; since the end of World War II, the figure is 85 percent. Which means that, in the length of a single generation, global warming has brought us to the brink of planetary catastrophe, and that the story of the industrial world’s kamikaze mission is also the story of a single lifetime. My father’s, for instance: born in 1938, among his first memories the news of Pearl Harbor and the mythic Air Force of the propaganda films that followed, films that doubled as advertisements for imperial-American industrial might; and among his last memories the coverage of the desperate signing of the Paris climate accords on cable news, ten weeks before he died of lung cancer last July. Or my mother’s: born in 1945, to German Jews fleeing the smokestacks through which their relatives were incinerated, now enjoying her 72nd year in an American commodity paradise, a paradise supported by the supply chains of an industrialized developing world. She has been smoking for 57 of those years, unfiltered.  Or the scientists’. Some of the men who first identified a changing climate (and given the generation, those who became famous were men) are still alive; a few are even still working. Wally Broecker is 84 years old and drives to work at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory across the Hudson every day from the Upper West Side. Like most of those who first raised the alarm, he believes that no amount of emissions reduction alone can meaningfully help avoid disaster. Instead, he puts his faith in carbon capture — untested technology to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which Broecker estimates will cost at least several trillion dollars — and various forms of “geoengineering,” the catchall name for a variety of moon-shot technologies far-fetched enough that many climate scientists prefer to regard them as dreams, or nightmares, from science fiction. He is especially focused on what’s called the aerosol approach — dispersing so much sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere that when it converts to sulfuric acid, it will cloud a fifth of the horizon and reflect back 2 percent of the sun’s rays, buying the planet at least a little wiggle room, heat-wise. “Of course, that would make our sunsets very red, would bleach the sky, would make more acid rain,” he says. “But you have to look at the magnitude of the problem. You got to watch that you don’t say the giant problem shouldn’t be solved because the solution causes some smaller problems.” He won’t be around to see that, he told me. “But in your lifetime …”  Jim Hansen is another member of this godfather generation. Born in 1941, he became a climatologist at the University of Iowa, developed the groundbreaking “Zero Model” for projecting climate change, and later became the head of climate research at NASA, only to leave under pressure when, while still a federal employee, he filed a lawsuit against the federal government charging inaction on warming (along the way he got arrested a few times for protesting, too). The lawsuit, which is brought by a collective called Our Children’s Trust and is often described as “kids versus climate change,” is built on an appeal to the equal-protection clause, namely, that in failing to take action on warming, the government is violating it by imposing massive costs on future generations; it is scheduled to be heard this winter in Oregon district court. Hansen has recently given up on solving the climate problem with a carbon tax alone, which had been his preferred approach, and has set about calculating the total cost of the additional measure of extracting carbon from the atmosphere.  Hansen began his career studying Venus, which was once a very Earth-like planet with plenty of life-supporting water before runaway climate change rapidly transformed it into an arid and uninhabitable sphere enveloped in an unbreathable gas; he switched to studying our planet by 30, wondering why he should be squinting across the solar system to explore rapid environmental change when he could see it all around him on the planet he was standing on. “When we wrote our first paper on this, in 1981,” he told me, “I remember saying to one of my co-authors, ‘This is going to be very interesting. Sometime during our careers, we’re going to see these things beginning to happen.’ ”  Several of the scientists I spoke with proposed global warming as the solution to Fermi’s famous paradox, which asks, If the universe is so big, then why haven’t we encountered any other intelligent life in it? The answer, they suggested, is that the natural life span of a civilization may be only several thousand years, and the life span of an industrial civilization perhaps only several hundred. In a universe that is many billions of years old, with star systems separated as much by time as by space, civilizations might emerge and develop and burn themselves up simply too fast to ever find one another. Peter Ward, a charismatic paleontologist among those responsible for discovering that the planet’s mass extinctions were caused by greenhouse gas, calls this the “Great Filter”: “Civilizations rise, but there’s an environmental filter that causes them to die off again and disappear fairly quickly,” he told me. “If you look at planet Earth, the filtering we’ve had in the past has been in these mass extinctions.” The mass extinction we are now living through has only just begun; so much more dying is coming.  And yet, improbably, Ward is an optimist. So are Broecker and Hansen and many of the other scientists I spoke to. We have not developed much of a religion of meaning around climate change that might comfort us, or give us purpose, in the face of possible annihilation. But climate scientists have a strange kind of faith: We will find a way to forestall radical warming, they say, because we must.  It is not easy to know how much to be reassured by that bleak certainty, and how much to wonder whether it is another form of delusion; for global warming to work as parable, of course, someone needs to survive to tell the story. The scientists know that to even meet the Paris goals, by 2050, carbon emissions from energy and industry, which are still rising, will have to fall by half each decade; emissions from land use (deforestation, cow farts, etc.) will have to zero out; and we will need to have invented technologies to extract, annually, twice as much carbon from the atmosphere as the entire planet’s plants now do. Nevertheless, by and large, the scientists have an enormous confidence in the ingenuity of humans — a confidence perhaps bolstered by their appreciation for climate change, which is, after all, a human invention, too. They point to the Apollo project, the hole in the ozone we patched in the 1980s, the passing of the fear of mutually assured destruction. Now we’ve found a way to engineer our own doomsday, and surely we will find a way to engineer our way out of it, one way or another. The planet is not used to being provoked like this, and climate systems designed to give feedback over centuries or millennia prevent us — even those who may be watching closely — from fully imagining the damage done already to the planet. But when we do truly see the world we’ve made, they say, we will also find a way to make it livable. For them, the alternative is simply unimaginable.  *This article appears in the July 10, 2017, issue of New York Magazine.  *This article has been updated to provide context for the recent news reports about revisions to a satellite data set, to more accurately reflect the rate of warming during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, to clarify a reference to Peter Brannen’s The Ends of the World, and to make clear that James Hansen still supports a carbon-tax based approach to emissions.

2478493a	In the Atlantic Ocean, Subtle Shifts Hint at Dramatic Dangers The warming atmosphere is causing an arm of the powerful Gulf Stream to weaken, some scientists fear.  The Gulf Stream has shaped climate and history on four continents. The Gulf Stream has shaped climate and history on four continents.

The fear: Melting Greenland ice will tip the delicate balance of hot and cold that defines not only the North Atlantic, but life far and wide. The New York Times.  It’s one of the mightiest rivers you will never see, carrying some 30 times more water than all the world’s freshwater rivers combined. In the North Atlantic, one arm of the Gulf Stream breaks toward Iceland, transporting vast amounts of warmth far northward, by one estimate supplying Scandinavia with heat equivalent to 78,000 times its current energy use. Without this current — a heat pump on a planetary scale — scientists believe that great swaths of the world might look quite different.  Now, a spate of studies, including one published last week, suggests this northern portion of the Gulf Stream and the deep ocean currents it’s connected to may be slowing. Pushing the bounds of oceanography, scientists have slung necklace-like sensor arrays across the Atlantic to better understand the complex network of currents that the Gulf Stream belongs to, not only at the surface, but hundreds of feet deep.  “We’re all wishing it’s not true,” Peter de Menocal, a paleoceanographer and president and director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said of the changing ocean currents. “Because if that happens, it’s just a monstrous change.”  The consequences could include faster sea level rise along parts of the Eastern United States and parts of Europe, stronger hurricanes barreling into the Southeastern United States, and perhaps most ominously, reduced rainfall across the Sahel, a semi-arid swath of land running the width of Africa that is already a geopolitical tinderbox.  The scientists’ concern stems from their understanding of thousands of years of the prehistoric climate record. In the past, a great weakening or even shutdown of this arm of the Gulf Stream seems to have triggered rapid changes in temperatures and precipitation patterns around the North Atlantic and beyond.  The northern arm of the Gulf Stream is but one tentacle of a larger, ocean-spanning tangle of currents called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC. Scientists have strong evidence from ice and sediment cores that the AMOC has weakened and shut down before in the past 13,000 years. As a result, mean temperatures in parts of Europe may have rapidly dropped to about 15 degrees Celsius below today’s averages, ushering in arctic like conditions. Parts of northern Africa and northern South America became much drier. Rainfall may even have declined as far away as what is now China. And some of these changes may have occurred in a matter of decades, maybe less.  The AMOC is thus a poster child for the idea of climatic “tipping points” — of hard-to-predict thresholds in Earth’s climate system that, once crossed, have rapid, cascading effects far beyond the corner of the globe where they occur. “It’s a switch,” said Dr. de Menocal, and one that can be thrown quickly.  Which brings us to the cold blob. Almost everywhere around the world, average temperatures are rising — except southeast of Greenland where a large patch of the North Atlantic has become colder in recent years.  Deep beneath the surface, scientists are searching for changes in the currents. Deep beneath the surface, scientists are searching for changes in the currents.

In short, the cold blob may signal that the northern arm of the Gulf Stream no longer arrives with the same strength to the North Atlantic. That a warming atmosphere has, paradoxically, cooled one part of the world.  The science remains relatively new, and not everyone agrees the AMOC is actually slowing. But in both scientific modeling of climate change and in the prehistoric record, a North Atlantic cooling presages a shutdown of the current. “One of the hallmarks of a shutdown is this cold blob,” says Dr. de Menocal. “The cold blob is a big deal.”  In 1513, the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León noticed something bizarre off the coast of today’s Florida: Relentless currents pushing his ships backward, overpowering the winds blowing them forward. He became the first European to describe the Gulf Stream. Benjamin Franklin finally mapped it in the late 1700s — he named it the “Gulf Stream” — by measuring changes in water temperature on a return trip from England.  Over the 20th century, oceanographers came to realize that the northern branch of the Gulf Stream was part of a gigantic loop of water, with warm surface water flowing north and colder water returning south, deep below the surface. This was the network of currents that scientists now call the AMOC.  The system was driven by North Atlantic water that, as it lost heat to the atmosphere and grew dense, sank to the ocean’s depths, pulling warmer surface water northward. In the middle part of the century, oceanographer Henry Stommel elucidated the physics of how the AMOC could change. His insight was that, depending on the balance of heat and salinity, the sinking effect—called “overturning”—could strengthen, or weaken, or maybe stop completely.  In the 1980s, Wallace Broecker, a geochemist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, pounced on that idea.  Colleagues studying ice cores from the Greenland ice sheet were seeing evidence of strange climatic “flickers” in the past. As Earth warmed from the deep freeze of the last ice age, which peaked around 22,000 years ago, temperatures would rise, then abruptly fall, then rise again just as swiftly. Dr. Broecker theorized this was caused by stops and starts in what he called the ocean’s “great conveyor belt” — the AMOC.  The clearest example began about 12,800 years ago. Glaciers that had once covered much of North America and Europe had retreated considerably, and the world was almost out of the deep freeze. But then, in just a few decades, Greenland and Western Europe plunged back into cold. Temperatures fell by around 10 degrees Celsius, or 18 degrees Fahrenheit, in parts of Greenland. Arctic-like conditions returned to parts of Europe.  The cold snap lasted perhaps 1,300 years — before reversing even more abruptly than it began. Scientists have observed the sudden changes in the pollen deposited at the bottom of European lakes and in changes in ocean sediments near Bermuda.  This forced a paradigm shift in how scientists thought about climate change. Earlier, they had tended to imagine creeping shifts occurring over many millennia. But by the late 1990s, they accepted that abrupt transitions, tipping points, could occur.  This didn’t bode well for humanity’s warming of the atmosphere. Dr. Broecker, who died in 2019, famously warned: “The climate system is an angry beast and we are poking it with sticks.”  Why did the AMOC shut down? A leading theory is that meltwater from retreating glaciers emptied into the North Atlantic or Arctic oceans. Freshwater is lighter than saltwater, and the sudden influx of more buoyant water could have impeded the sinking of denser, saltier water — that critical “overturning” phase of the AMOC.  Today we don’t have massive glacial lakes threatening to disgorge into the North Atlantic. But we do have the Greenland ice sheet, which is melting at the upper end of projections, or about six times faster than in the 1990s. And according to one study, the subpolar North Atlantic recently became less salty than at any time in the past 120 years.  There’s little agreement on cause. Changes in wind patterns or currents may be contributing, as could greater rainfall. But Stefan Rahmstorf, a physical oceanographer with the University of Potsdam in Germany, suspects that, similar to what happened some 12,800 years ago, meltwater from Greenland is beginning to slow the AMOC.  In 2014, a remarkable project launched in the North Atlantic. An array of sophisticated sensors were moored to the ocean floor between Newfoundland, Greenland and Scotland. They’re starting to provide an unprecedented view of the currents that shape the Atlantic.  Here off Labrador, we can see how waters move deep beneath the surface.

In 2015, Dr. Rahmstorf and his colleagues published a seminal paper arguing that the AMOC had weakened by 15 percent in recent decades, a slowdown they said was unprecedented in the past 1,000 years. He and his colleagues recently published another paper that used additional reconstructions of sea temperature around the North Atlantic, some going back 1,600 years, to determine that the recent slowdown began with the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, then accelerated after 1950.  Other scientists have also presented different evidence of a slowdown. The South Atlantic has become saltier in recent decades, according to a study by Chenyu Zhu at Ocean University of China and Zhengyu Liu at Nanjing Normal University, suggesting that more of the salt that once traveled north with the AMOC now remains in the tropics, producing what they call a “salinity pile-up.”  And Christopher Piecuch of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution recently argued that the Gulf Stream along Florida’s coast, also called the Florida current, has weakened. He found this by measuring the differences in sea level across the Gulf Stream. Earth’s rotation deflects flowing water to the right; this causes the two sides of the current to have slightly different sea levels — and the faster the current, the greater the difference. Tide gauge measurements going back 110 years indicate that this contrast has declined, Dr. Piecuch found, particularly in the past two decades. This suggests the current has slowed.  For Dr. Rahmstorf, these lines of evidence bolster the argument that the AMOC is slowing. In his view, the change is occurring right on schedule. “The long-term trend is exactly what was predicted by the models,” he said.  A 2019 report by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a synthesis of the most significant climate research worldwide, says that while the AMOC will “very likely” weaken later this century, collapse is “very unlikely.” Yet Dr. Rahmstorf worries about the unknowns in a system that scientists understand can rapidly shift between different states.  He points out that, in IPCC jargon, “very unlikely” translates to a probability of less than 10 percent. But if a nuclear reactor in your neighborhood had a less-than-10-percent likelihood of blowing up, he asked, “would you be reassured?”  “We still don’t know how far away this threshold is where it could break down altogether,” he said. If we limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times — a goal of the Paris agreement among nations to fight climate change — a shutdown is unlikely, he thinks. “But for unmitigated warming,” which is the world’s current trajectory, “I think there’s increasing risk where we make AMOC so weak it goes over the edge and collapses.”  “There will be a lot of surprises if we disturb climate that much,” he said. “It’s not at all predictable how bad things will be.”  Scientists also emphasize that the ultimate consequences of that weakening remain unclear. That’s in part because the world is in such uncharted territory. In the past, Europe became drastically cooler when the current shut down, but today any cooling might ultimately be muted or possibly canceled out by continued global heating.  But if past is prologue, a drastically altered AMOC could certainly shift rainfall patterns, scientists said, making parts of Europe and Northern Africa drier, and areas in the Southern hemisphere wetter. Changing ocean currents might affect marine ecosystems that people rely on for food and livelihood.  A changing Gulf Stream could also accelerate sea-level rise along parts of the Atlantic coast of the United States. In 2009 and 2010, when the stream inexplicably weakened by 30 percent, the Northeast saw seas rise at a rate unprecedented in the entire roughly 100-year record of tide gauges.  And if water in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic becomes warmer because that heat is no longer shunted north, the expanding reservoir of energy could strengthen hurricanes, something that scientists at the National Oceanography Centre in the United Kingdom argue is already happening. Hurricanes derive their energy from heat in the water.  Finally, in a perverse twist, a shutdown of the AMOC could exacerbate global heating. The ocean absorbs nearly one-third of human carbon dioxide emissions. But the sinking of salty, dense water — the overturning portion of the AMOC — is critical to that absorption. So, if the AMOC stops or greatly slows, and that water stops sinking, the accumulation of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere could accelerate.  Then there are those consequences that fall in the category of “global weirding.”  Scientists at the U.K.’s National Oceanography Centre have somewhat counterintuitively linked the cold blob in the North Atlantic with summer heat waves in Europe. In 2015 and 2018, the jet stream, a river of wind that moves from west to east over temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere, made an unusual detour to the south around the cold blob. The wrinkle in atmospheric flow brought hotter-than-usual air into Europe, they contend, breaking temperature records.  The New York Times.  “That was not predicted,” said Joel Hirschi, principal scientist at the centre and senior author of the research. It highlights how current seasonal forecasting models are unable to predict these warm summers. And it underscores the paradox that, far from ushering in a frigid future for, say, Paris, a cooler North Atlantic might actually make France’s summers more like Morocco’s.  Even so, Dr. Hirschi takes a wait-and-see stance on whether the AMOC is actually slowing. “I have great respect for what Dr. Rahmstorf is doing. And it may well be spot on in the end,” he says. “But I’m afraid the data, the really robust data, is not there.”  Susan Lozier, a physical oceanographer and dean at the College of Sciences at Georgia Tech, also has her doubts about whether the AMOC is currently slowing. At issue, she says, is how scientists infer changes in the AMOC. We can directly measure many aspects of the ocean, such as temperature (it’s warming), oxygen levels (they’re declining), even how stratified it has become (more so). “There are very strong signals in the ocean of climate change,” she said.  But most studies on the AMOC don’t measure the “conveyor belt” directly. Instead, they use proxies to infer that the overturning has changed.  Such inference can be problematic when considering changes that occur over short time frames, says Dr. Lozier, because the changes observed could have other causes. Consider that cold blob in the North Atlantic, she said. Dr. Rahmstorf and others see it as evidence of a weakening Gulf Stream, but Dr. Lozier notes that shifts in wind patterns or how storms move over the ocean could also underlie the phenomenon. “There are other ways to explain it,” she said. “A lot of our conceptual understanding of AMOC is in isolation of other things going on in the ocean.”  Direct measurement of the AMOC only began relatively recently. A line of sensors between the Bahamas and the Canary Islands, called Rapid, was installed in 2004. A second sensor array, spanning the North Atlantic from Canada to Greenland to Scotland and called Osnap, went live in 2014. (Dr. Lozier is the international project lead for Osnap.)  Neither project has operated long enough to produce clear trends, in Dr. Lozier’s view. What they have shown, though, is lots of natural variability. In 2009 and 2010, for example, the AMOC weakened — “people were like, ‘Oh my God, this is happening,’” she said — only to pick right back up again over the following years.  They’ve also revealed a system of currents that’s far more complex than once envisioned.  Dr. Broecker’s old schematics of the AMOC posit a neat warm current flowing north along the western edge of the Atlantic and an equally neat cold current flowing back south below it. In fact, says Dr. Lozier, that deeper current is not confined to the western edge of the Atlantic, but rather flows southward via a number of “rivers” that are filled with eddies. The network of deep ocean currents is much more complicated than once envisioned, in other words, and figuring out how buoyant meltwater from Greenland might affect the formation of cold deepwater has become more complicated as well.  This is the place scientists currently find themselves in. They suspect the AMOC can work like a climate switch. They’re watching it closely. Some argue that it’s already changing, others that it’s too soon to tell.  “There’s no consensus on whether it has slowed to date, or if it’s currently slowing,” said Dr. Lozier. “But there is a consensus that if we continue to warm the atmosphere, it will slow.”	Im Atlantik deuten subtile Verschiebungen auf dramatische Gefahren hin	partially false
a910fe22	"Over the past year, scientists have been keeping a close eye on an important swath of the Pacific Ocean, just along the equator. When conditions here get just right, an El Niño can form — wreaking havoc on weather patterns across the globe.  The El Niño currently brewing in the Pacific is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever recorded. This phenomenon is expected to peak before January, with far-reaching impacts all winter and spring. Based on past experience, El Niño could potentially bring much-needed rain to California, but also drought in Australia, destructive floods in Peru, and so on. El Niño has already helped make 2015 the hottest year on record — and might well do the same for 2016.  That said, El Niño events are often unpredictable and full of surprises. So what follows is a guide to how El Niño works, what we know about the 2015 event, and how a potentially massive El Niño could upend the world's weather over the coming months.  A very basic definition of El Niño  El Niño is a weather phenomenon that occurs irregularly in the eastern tropical Pacific every two to seven years. When the trade winds that usually blow from east to west weaken, sea surface temperatures start rising, setting off a chain of atmospheric impacts.  El Niños can be strong or weak. Strong events can temporarily disrupt weather patterns around the world, typically making certain regions wetter (Peru or California, say) and others drier (Southeast Asia). Some countries suffer major damage as a result.  El Niños also transfer heat stored in the deeper layers of the ocean to the surface. When combined with global warming, that can lead to record hot years, as in 1998.  ""El Niño"" got its name in the 1800s from Peruvian fisherman, who first noticed a mysterious warm current that would appear around Christmas. They called it the ""little boy"" or ""Christ child.""  Why this year's El Niño is a huge deal  The last truly massive El Niño appeared in 1997-'98 and ended up causing an estimated $35 billion in destruction and 23,000 deaths around the world. (It also inspired that famous Chris Farley sketch.) Now we're facing a similarly massive event:  That, in itself, is a surprise. Back in March, NOAA's Climate Prediction Center announced that a weak El Niño had formed in the Pacific, but many experts initially thought it might fizzle out by summer. Instead, this El Niño kept strengthening, with ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific continuing to soar. By mid-November, temperatures in one critical part of the ocean, the Niño 3.4 region, were running even hotter than they were in 1997:  ""Right now we say we think it's really going to be one of the three strongest ones,"" said Michel Jarraud, the secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization, who compared it with the 1997-98, 1982-83, and 1972-73 El Niño events. ""It may be one of the two; that we don't know yet. But definitely it's already a very strong one.""  Countries across the globe will have to brace themselves as this event peaks this winter and lasts through the spring. El Niño has already triggered longer droughts in Indonesia, enabling massive man-made peatland fires to rage out of control, creating toxic haze that has spread as far as Singapore. Warmer ocean temperatures have also caused a major coral bleaching event, harming reefs around the world.  And El Niño may just be getting started: In the past, major events have brought unusually hot, dry weather to Australia that can cramp wheat yields and amp up wildfires. It can bring hotter, drier weather to India that hurts agriculture. It can bring heavy rain and destructive flooding to Peru, washing away houses and spreading cholera.  That said, El Niño isn't all bad. In the United States, it could bring some needed rain this winter to ease California's drought (though also deadly mudslides and flooding). Historically, El Niño has also served up milder US winters and tamped down on Atlantic hurricanes.  One important caveat, however, is that every El Niño unfolds a bit differently — and some have unexpected impacts. As NOAA's Emily Becker points out, strong El Niño events usually bring rain to California in the winter (as in 1982-'83), but occasionally they don't (as in 1965-'66):  Another key story to watch is how a strong El Niño might push up temperatures worldwide. Global average temperatures are already going up over time, thanks to all the carbon dioxide we're adding to the atmosphere. According to NASA, 2014 was the hottest year on record. But there was no El Niño that year — and El Niño years tend to be a bit hotter than average, as heat gets transferred from the ocean to the surface.  The combination of El Niño and rising CO2 is already helping 2015 shatter heat records. The big question now is whether it'll do the same for 2016:  Bottom line: There are still a lot of question marks about how this will unfold. But El Niño could well be the biggest weather story of the next several months, with ripple effects around the globe.  How El Niño actually works, step by step  To see how El Niño works, it helps to understand what the equatorial Pacific looks like under normal, or ""neutral,"" conditions:  1) Neutral conditions in the equatorial Pacific Ocean  Normally, the tropical Pacific features strong trade winds that blow warm ocean water from east to west, where it piles up near Indonesia. Meanwhile, back east along South America, frigid water deep down in the ocean gets pulled up closer to the surface, cooling the area around Peru. Here's a diagram:  As a result, during ""neutral"" conditions, sea levels are about half a meter higher near Indonesia than they are in Peru. And the surface water near Indonesia is about 8°C warmer (14.4°F) than it is near Peru. That temperature difference creates a convective loop in the atmosphere that, in turn, reinforces the trade winds.  This ends up affecting a lot more than just this stretch of ocean. Because the Pacific is so vast, this system is a major driving force in the global climate. The large, warm pool of water near Indonesia causes the air above it to rise, creating rainfall in the region. And this system shapes the jet streams that guide weather and storms around the world.  That's how it works under normal conditions, anyway. But things look a little different when El Niño comes along.  2) Now along comes El Niño  Every few years, those prevailing Pacific trade winds that blow east to west can weaken. (Scientists are still debating the nuances of exactly why this happens.)  When the trade winds weaken, all that warm water that was piled up near Indonesia starts sloshing back eastward, pulled back down by gravity. What's more, the underwater layer known as the thermocline starts sinking. As a result, there's less cold water rising up from the deep ocean near South America — so the waters near Peru start warming up. Here's another diagram:  This causes sea surface temperatures in the east and central Pacific to start rising and the trade winds to weaken even further. What's more, rainfall starts following that warm pool of water as it travels eastward. That's why El Niño is usually associated with drier weather in places like Indonesia and Australia, as well as heavier rains in places like Peru (or California). The rain is essentially moving east.  Scientists officially declare an El Niño when sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean (known as the Niño 3.4 region) rise 0.5°C above their historical baseline for three months in a row — and once atmospheric conditions and rainfall patterns shift accordingly.  Again, because the Pacific is so vast, an El Niño can have large ripple effects on weather around the world, especially during the winter months. Here's a look at the changes that have historically accompanied El Niño events:  Typical effects of an El Niño during the winter:  A strong El Niño can weaken monsoons in the Indian Ocean, for example. It can also cause the jet stream to start stretching from the Eastern Pacific across the southern United States, bringing rainfall and storms with it. Still, a lot depends on how strong the El Niño actually is — and occasionally there are aberrations and exceptions to the rule. More on that below.  El Niño's return in 2015 — and why scientists have been talking about a ""Godzilla"" event  Ever since early 2014, scientists have been expecting this latest El Niño to form. But, in a sign of how slippery the system can be, El Niño kept defying predictions and not showing up.  Finally, in March 2015, after several false starts, scientists at NOAA's climate prediction center were ready to declare that a weak El Niño was underway. Specifically, sea surface temperatures in that Niño 3.4 region (roughly in the center of the chart below) had been at least 0.5°C above their baseline since September. And, importantly, atmospheric conditions were responding in turn, with more rain over the central Pacific and less rain over Indonesia:  At the time, however, NOAA's forecasters said that this El Niño looked ""weak,"" with possibly minimal effects on global weather patterns, and only had a 50 to 60 percent chance of lasting through the summer.  Then, somewhat unexpectedly, El Niño kept getting stronger and stronger. And stronger. By October 2015, sea surface temperatures had soared to more than 2°C above baseline in the Niño 3.4 region, and scientists were seeing strong telltale atmospheric changes. Notice how the anomalous warm area has moved east and is much, much warmer than usual:  Forecasters now expect this El Niño to peak between October and January, and when it does, it's likely to rank among the two or three strongest ever record (along with 1997-'98, 1982-'83, and 1972-'73.) Some forecasters have even dubbed this one a potential ""Godzilla.""  We're already started to see some major El Niño impacts around the world. A paucity of rainfall in Indonesia this fall allowed manmade forest and peat fires to rage out of control, choking the region in a thick toxic haze. And the warmer Pacific waters have fostered an unusually active tropical cyclone season, a hallmark of El Niño. On the flip side, however, the event has also fostered more wind shear in the Atlantic that has curtailed hurricane activity there.  El Niño could bring rain to California — but may not end the drought  As noted above, El Niño tends to be associated with changes in weather patterns around the world, especially during the Northern Hemisphere winter. One tantalizing possibility is that a strong El Niño will bring more rain to California, alleviating the state's drought.  But even here, nothing is certain. El Niño only affects US weather indirectly, by altering atmospheric circulation and shifting the North Pacific jet stream. (See here for a lucid explanation by Columbia University's Anthony Barnston.) This is an intricate chain of events, and small kinks at certain points can affect the ultimate outcome.  As such, Becker cautions people to think not in terms of certainties but in terms of probabilities. Here's an example of how El Niño might shift the odds of a wetter-than-average winter for California (she notes that this isn't a prediction, just an illustration):  In other words, thanks to El Niño, California has a greater chance of a wetter winter, but not a 100 percent chance.  What's more, even if rain does come, that may not be enough to completely erase the massive water deficit that California has built up over the past five years. The state likely needs record precipitation to end the drought, and it also needs the right mix of rain (to recharge the reservoirs) and snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains (to melt during the spring and summer).  Also, be warned: Heavy rain after a drought can bring floods and mudslides. Southern California got a possible preview in mid-October, when a short burst of intense rains led to major mudflows that trapped hundreds of cars. So people need to be ready.  El Niño tends to hurt some countries and benefit others  It's not quite right to say that El Niño events are ""bad"" or ""good."" They tend to have different impacts on different regions.  One recent study from the University of Cambridge found that on average, El Niño events hurt economic activity in Australia, Chile, Indonesia, India, Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa. The reasons varied: drought and reduced crop yields in Australia and India, forest fires in Indonesia, less productive fisheries in Peru.  But that study also found that on average, El Niño tended to boost the economies in Argentina, Canada, Mexico, and even the United States, at least in the very short term. Again, many factors were at play: In addition to bringing needed rain to California and Texas, El Niño was associated with less tornado activity in the midwestern United States and fewer hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean.  Here's a table of the estimated economic impacts on a broad selection of countries:  Again, every big El Niño is different and has its own idiosyncrasies. So think of this table as more a rough guide than gospel.  There are also two important twists here. As the WMO's Michel Jarraud stressed in his October news conference, many countries have learned from the past and implemented measures to guard against El Niño's impacts. (Mexico, for instance, was well-prepared for a record-strength Pacific hurricane that hit the state last month.)  Conversely, this El Niño is also playing out in the context of record warm ocean temperatures, so it could have unpredictable impacts. ""Our scientific understanding of El Niño has increased greatly in recent years. However, this event is playing out in uncharted territory,"" said Jarraud. ""This naturally occurring El Niño event and human induced climate change may interact and modify each other in ways which we have never before experienced.""  El Niño is helping make 2015 a record hot year. What about 2016?  Thanks to global warming, the Earth's average surface temperature has been going up over time. But there's a lot of variation from year to year. El Niño years tend to be a bit hotter than average. La Niña years (when those trade winds strengthen rather than weaken) tend to be a bit cooler than average. Like so:  What's going on here? As humans load more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, we're trapping more and more heat on the Earth's surface. But more than 90 percent of that extra heat is absorbed by the oceans. So subtle interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere can make a big difference for surface temperatures.  When conditions in the Pacific are neutral, more of that heat is trapped beneath the ocean surface. When a strong El Niño forms, more of that heat is transferred to the surface. That's why the Earth's average surface temperatures reached new highs in 1998: You had the combination of global warming and an extremely strong El Niño.  What was remarkable about 2014 is that it was likely the hottest year on record even without an El Niño event — a sign that Earth keeps getting warmer overall. Meanwhile, 2015 is basically guaranteed to be even hotter than 2014.  Now throw a monster El Niño into the mix, and we're looking at a potential shattering of records. Back in January, NASA's Gavin Schmidt explained at a press conference that temperatures typically peak about three months after an El Niño event. Given that forecasters expect this current El Niño to last until next spring, it's entirely possible we could see 2016 also set new highs. We'll have to wait and see.

93db83ce	"Wenn sich die UN-Klimaunterhändler diesen Monat zu Gipfelgesprächen treffen, wird eine neue Zahl auf dem Tisch liegen: 3C. Bisher haben globale Bemühungen wie das Pariser Klimaabkommen versucht, die globale Erwärmung auf 2 °C über dem vorindustriellen Niveau zu begrenzen. Angesichts der jüngsten Prognosen, die auf einen Anstieg um 3,2 °C bis 2100 hindeuten, scheinen diese Ziele jedoch außer Reichweite zu geraten. Globale Temperaturänderung im Vergleich zum vorindustriellen Niveau „[Wir] befinden uns immer noch in einer Situation, in der wir nicht annähernd genug tun, um Hunderte Millionen Menschen vor einer miserablen Zukunft zu bewahren“, sagte Erik Solheim, der UN-Umweltchef, voraus die bevorstehende Bonner Konferenz. Eine der größten daraus resultierenden Bedrohungen für Städte auf der ganzen Welt ist der Anstieg des Meeresspiegels, der durch die Ausdehnung des Wassers bei höheren Temperaturen und schmelzende Eisschilde am Nord- und Südpol verursacht wird. Wissenschaftler der gemeinnützigen Organisation Climate Central schätzen, dass weltweit 275 Millionen Menschen in Gebieten leben, die bei 3 °C globaler Erwärmung irgendwann überflutet werden. Asiatische Städte werden am stärksten betroffen sein Die regionalen Auswirkungen dieser Veränderungen sind sehr unterschiedlich, da vier von fünf betroffenen Menschen in Asien leben. Obwohl der Meeresspiegel nicht sofort ansteigen wird, werden die berechneten Anstiege bei einem Temperaturanstieg von 3 °C „eingefroren“, was bedeutet, dass sie irreversibel sind, selbst wenn sich die Erwärmung schließlich verlangsamt. Osaka, Japan 5,2 Millionen Menschen betroffen Am Ende eines Monats, in dem es von ungewöhnlich späten Taifunen und unerbittlichen Regenfällen heimgesucht wurde, sieht sich Japan bereits mit der Bedrohung durch klimawandelbedingte Überschwemmungen konfrontiert. Bildmodelle zeigen, dass Teile von Osaka – dem kommerziellen Zentrum einer Region, deren BIP fast so groß ist wie das der Niederlande – in einer 3C-Welt unter Wasser verschwinden würden, was die lokale Wirtschaft und fast ein Drittel der 19 Millionen Einwohner der weiteren Region bedrohen würde Bewohner. Im Stadtgebiet um Osaka leben Millionen Menschen. Der Anstieg des Meeresspiegels wird dicht und dünn besiedelte Gebiete verändern. Aufgrund des globalen Anstiegs des Meeresspiegels, Sturmfluten und anderer Faktoren gehen Ökonomen davon aus, dass Küstenüberschwemmungen laut der Union of Concerned Scientists bis in die 2070er Jahre fast 1 Billion US-Dollar des Vermögens von Osaka gefährden könnten. „Die Kosten für den Schutz von Städten vor steigendem Meeresspiegel und Stürmen werden wahrscheinlich ebenfalls steigen – ebenso wie die Kosten für die Reparatur von Sturmschäden“, hieß es. „Entscheidungen, die wir heute treffen, könnten tiefgreifende Auswirkungen auf die Sicherheit und Kultur der Menschen in dieser antiken Stadt haben.“ Wie weite Teile Japans verfügt Osaka bereits über ein Netz von Deichen und anderen Küstenverteidigungsanlagen zur Bekämpfung des Tsunamis – obwohl ihre Wirksamkeit nach der Dreifachkatastrophe von 2011 umstritten war. Die Stadtverwaltung von Osaka investiert in andere Infrastrukturen, um die Auswirkungen von Überschwemmungen abzumildern, aber auch die öffentliche Bildung ist laut Toshikazu Nakaaki vom Umweltamt der Stadtverwaltung von Osaka von entscheidender Bedeutung. „In der Vergangenheit konzentrierte sich unsere Reaktion darauf, die Ursachen der globalen Erwärmung zu verringern, aber angesichts der Tatsache, dass der Klimawandel unvermeidlich ist, diskutieren wir laut dem Zwischenstaatlichen Ausschuss für Klimaänderungen (IPCC) jetzt, wie wir auf die folgenden Naturkatastrophen reagieren können “, sagte Nakaaki. „Wir gehen davon aus, dass Osaka von durch den Klimawandel verursachten Naturkatastrophen betroffen sein wird, aber wir müssen noch genau feststellen, was passieren könnte oder wie viel finanzieller Schaden sie verursachen würden. „Es ist nicht so, dass wir irgendwann in der Zukunft mit einem Anstieg des Meeresspiegels rechnen – er steigt bereits.“ Keiko Kanai ist sich seit langem bewusst, dass ihre Heimatstadt anfällig für Naturkatastrophen ist. „Ich hatte gehört, dass durch Erdbeben verursachte Tsunamis in der Vergangenheit viele Teile von Osaka unter Wasser gesetzt haben, und ich wusste, dass einige Teile der Welt durch den steigenden Meeresspiegel gefährdet waren“, sagte Kanai, der an einer örtlichen Universität lehrt. „Aber ich habe nicht zwei und zwei zusammengezählt. Bis jetzt habe ich nicht viel darüber nachgedacht, dass auch Osaka vom steigenden Meeresspiegel verschlungen werden könnte.“ Kaori Akazawa, eine Pflegeberaterin, sagte, Überschwemmungen seien eine Überlegung gewesen, als sie überlegte, wo sie in Osaka leben wollte. „Als ich hierher gezogen bin, habe ich mit meinen Kollegen über die Risiken gesprochen“, sagte sie. „Deshalb habe ich immer Wohnungen im vierten Stock oder höher gemietet. „Es ist beunruhigend, aber ich habe nie daran gedacht, umzuziehen.“ Justin McCurry in Tokio Alexandria, Ägypten 3 Millionen Menschen betroffen An der Corniche von Alexandria schlagen Wellen langsam an eine Küste, die mit Plastikstühlen und Sonnenschirmen von Strandcafés übersät ist. Studenten sitzen auf den Stufen der imposanten Bibliothek von Alexandria. Aber die gleiche Küste, die die Einheimischen mit ihren malerischen Aussichten anzieht, droht, die historische Stadt langsam zu verschlingen, da der Meeresspiegel aufgrund der globalen Erwärmung steigt. Das IPCC berichtete, dass die Strände von Alexandria selbst bei einem Anstieg des Meeresspiegels um 0,5 Meter überschwemmt würden, während 8 Millionen Menschen durch Überschwemmungen in Alexandria und im Nildelta vertrieben würden, wenn keine Schutzmaßnahmen ergriffen würden. Einer 3C-Welt droht weitaus größerer Schaden als das. Für viele Einwohner gibt es jedoch nur wenige öffentliche Informationen, um das zunehmend chaotische Wetter und die Überschwemmungen mit dem Klimawandel in Verbindung zu bringen. „Die überwiegende Mehrheit der Alexandriner hat keinen Zugang zu Wissen, und das macht mir Sorgen. Ich erwarte nicht, dass die Regierung das Bewusstsein für dieses Problem schärft, bis es bereits passiert“, sagte der 22-jährige Student Kareem Mohammed. „Alle denken, dass wir dieses Problem in 50 oder 80 Jahren angehen sollten“, stimmte sein Freund Hazem Hassan zu, ein Student der Meeresbiologie an der nahe gelegenen Universität von Alexandria. Beamte behaupten, dass Schutzmaßnahmen ergriffen werden, jedoch mit wenig Tamtam. „Ägypten gibt jährlich 700 Millionen EGP [30 Millionen Pfund] aus, um die Nordküste zu schützen“, sagte Dr. Magdy Allam, Leiterin der Arab Environmental Experts Union, die zuvor dem ägyptischen Umweltministerium angehörte. Allam nannte die 1830 errichtete Meeresmauer von Mohammed Ali als Schlüsselschutz, ebenso wie die Betonblöcke, die die Küste säumen, um „Hochwasser von Wohngebieten wegzuleiten“. Kritiker sagen jedoch, dass dies angesichts des Ausmaßes des Problems bei weitem nicht ausreicht. „Es gibt Studien, die darauf hindeuten, dass unsere Stadt eine von vielen menschlichen Siedlungen an der Küste auf der ganzen Welt ist, die bis 2070 teilweise unter Wasser sein werden, wenn nichts unternommen wird“, sagte Ahmed Hassan von der Save Alexandria Initiative, einer Gruppe, die daran arbeitet, das Bewusstsein für die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels auf die Stadt. Ruth Michaelson in Alexandria Rio de Janeiro, Brasilien 1,8 Millionen Menschen betroffen Die Bewohner der brasilianischen Postkartenstadt haben viele Gründe, die Erderwärmung zu fürchten – auch wenn sie es nicht genau wissen. Laut Climate Central würde ein Temperaturanstieg von 3 °C nicht nur die berühmten Strände von Rio wie die Copacabana und den Inlandsflughafen am Wasser überschwemmen, sondern auch die Binnengebiete des Viertels Barra de Tijuca, wo im vergangenen Jahr die Olympischen Spiele stattfanden. Barra ist um ein Netzwerk stark verschmutzter Lagunen herum gebaut, die ins Meer münden. Die Aussicht, dass es sich um Unterwasser handelte, alarmierte die Bewohnerin Sueli Gonçalves, 46, die Gesundheitsprojekte für Rentner leitet, als sie und ihr 23-jähriger Sohn Yuri Sanchez ihre Einkäufe am Olympiapark vorbeitrugen. ""Mein Gott. Oh Jesus“, sagte sie mit einem nervösen Lachen. ""Ich werde hier gehen. Ich werde in die Vereinigten Staaten gehen. Nach Kanada."" Die Familie wusste um die globale Erwärmung, war sich aber des potenziellen Ausmaßes der Auswirkungen auf ihre gehobene Nachbarschaft mit eleganten Eigentumswohnungen und einem Einkaufszentrum nicht bewusst. „Niemand nimmt es ernst. Die Leute denken nicht langfristig“, sagte Gonçalves. Sturmfluten zerstörten kürzlich Hunderte von Metern Strandpflaster mit Blick auf den Strand von Macumba, einem beliebten Surfspot am westlichen Rand von Rio. Letztes Jahr stürzten schwere Wellen in einer weiteren Sturmflut einen erhöhten Radweg auf einer Klippe zwischen dem Strand von Leblon und Barra de Tijuca, der nicht gebaut worden war, um solch hoher See standzuhalten, und töteten zwei Menschen. Im vergangenen Jahr haben die Stadtregierung von Rio und die Bundesuniversität von Rio de Janeiro eine Studie mit dem Titel Strategy for Adapting to Climate Change erstellt. „Die aktuelle Herausforderung besteht darin, das Wissen und die Überwachung ozeanischer Phänomene und der Entwicklung des Meeresbodens und der Küste zu vertiefen“, sagte eine Sprecherin des Umweltsekretariats der Stadt in einer E-Mail. Ein mit Professoren der Bundesuniversität erstellter „Anpassungsplan“ an den Klimawandel schlug Strategien vor, um mit Schwachstellen in Bereichen wie Verkehr, Gesundheit und Wohnen umzugehen. Aber bisher hat sich wenig getan. Nara Pinto, 38, die in der weitläufigen Favela Rocinha lebt und Snacks auf dem Bürgersteig mit Blick auf den Strand von Copacabana verkauft, sagte, der Verlust von Rios berühmten Stränden würde viele Arbeitsplätze kosten. „Der Strand ist ein touristischer Anziehungspunkt“, sagte sie. „Was kann man dagegen tun? Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro Shanghai, China 17,5 Millionen Menschen betroffen „Shanghai ist komplett weg – ich müsste nach Tibet ziehen!“ sagt der Bewohner Wang Liubin, als ihm Projektionen für die Stadt nach 3°C globaler Erwärmung gezeigt werden. Was Überschwemmungen angeht, ist die Küstenstadt eine der am stärksten gefährdeten der Welt. Das ehemalige Fischerdorf, das heute einer der größten Häfen der Welt ist, wird im Norden vom Jangtse begrenzt und in der Mitte vom Huangpu-Fluss geteilt; Die Gemeinde umfasst mehrere Inseln, zwei lange Küsten, Schifffahrtshäfen und kilometerlange Kanäle, Flüsse und Wasserstraßen. Im Jahr 2012 erklärte ein Bericht eines Teams britischer und niederländischer Wissenschaftler Shanghai zur anfälligsten Großstadt der Welt für schwere Überschwemmungen, basierend auf Faktoren wie der Anzahl der Menschen, die in Küstennähe leben, der Zeit, die benötigt wird, um sich von Überschwemmungen zu erholen, und Maßnahmen Hochwasser zu verhindern. Laut Prognosen von Climate Central könnten 17,5 Millionen Menschen durch steigende Wassermassen vertrieben werden, wenn die globalen Temperaturen um 3 ° C steigen. Projektionen zeigen, dass der überwiegende Teil der Stadt schließlich in Wasser getaucht sein könnte, darunter ein Großteil der Innenstadt, Sehenswürdigkeiten wie die Lujiazui-Skyline und der historische Bund, beide Flughäfen und die gesamte vorgelagerte Insel Chongming. Seit 2012 unternimmt die Regierung stetige Fortschritte, um die Bedrohung zu bekämpfen, einschließlich des Baus von Chinas größtem Tiefwasserentwässerungssystem unter der Wasserstraße Suzhou Creek, das aus 15 km langen Rohren besteht, um Regenwasser auf einer Fläche von 58 km² abzuleiten. Es hat auch ein 40-Milliarden-Yuan (5-Milliarden-£)-Flussentlastungsprojekt ins Leben gerufen, das sich über 120 km zwischen dem Taihu-See und dem Huangpu-Fluss erstrecken wird, um zu versuchen, das Risiko der Überschwemmung des stromaufwärts gelegenen Sees zu mindern. Entlang der Uferpromenade werden Hochwasserschutzmauern gebaut – an Stellen, die so hoch sind, dass der Fluss nicht sichtbar ist – und weitere 200 km in den Randbezirken der Stadt versprochen. Entlang der berühmten Uferpromenade Bund wurden Hochwasserschutzmaßnahmen eingerichtet, wo der Gehweg erhöht wurde, um einem Hochwasserrisiko entgegenzuwirken, sowie eine Reihe von Wasserkontrollen und Dämmen. Helen Roxburgh in Shanghai Miami, USA 2,7 Millionen Menschen betroffen Wenige andere Städte der Welt haben so viel durch den steigenden Meeresspiegel zu verlieren wie Miami, und die Alarmglocken läuten immer lauter mit jeder aufeinanderfolgenden „Königsflut“, die die Küstenverteidigung überwältigt und Knie verursacht -tiefes Meerwasser, das durch die Straßen der Innenstadt fließt. Einheimische betrachten dies als die „neue Normalität“ in der größten Stadt des größten Ballungsraums Floridas, die bei einem Temperaturanstieg von 3 ° C einfach aufhören würde zu existieren. Selbst bei 2 °C zeigen Prognosen, dass fast das gesamte untere Drittel Floridas – das Gebiet südlich des Okeechobee-Sees, in dem derzeit mehr als 7 Millionen Menschen leben – überflutet ist, mit düsteren Prognosen für den Rest des Bundesstaates in etwas mehr als einem halben Jahrhundert. Allein im Landkreis Miami-Dade sind Küstengrundstücke im Wert von fast 15 Milliarden US-Dollar in den nächsten 15 Jahren von Überschwemmungen bedroht. Im Rathaus wird ein Gefühl der Dringlichkeit deutlich, wo die Kommissare die Wähler auffordern, bei der Abstimmung im November eine „Miami Forever“-Anleihe zu genehmigen, die 192 Millionen US-Dollar für die Modernisierung von Pumpstationen, die Verbesserung der Entwässerung und die Erhöhung von Deichen umfasst. „Wir haben eine wirklich wertvolle Stadt, die viele Menschen lieben und in die sie bereit sind zu investieren, aber es wird einige Mittel brauchen, um sie zu schützen“, sagte Ken Russell, der stellvertretende Vorsitzende der Stadtkommission. Im vergangenen Jahr ernannte die Stadt Miami die Seegangsexpertin Jane Gilbert in die neu geschaffene Rolle des Chief Resilience Officer mit Anweisungen für einen robusten Regenwassermanagementplan, der auch Sturmfluten berücksichtigt, wie beispielsweise die durch den Hurrikan Irma im September, der erhebliche Überschwemmungen mit sich brachte in die Innenstadt von Brickell und zum benachbarten Coconut Grove. Zu den Vorschlägen gehören die Anhebung von Straßen und sogar die Überlassung von Nachbarschaften an das Wasser, um andere zu schützen. „Wir brauchen die universelle Anerkennung, dass wir alle zusammenhalten, um diese erstaunliche globale Stadt zu schützen, zu der wir geworden sind“, sagte sie. Natalia Ortiz, die in Miami aufgewachsen ist, hat Angst vor der Zukunft. „Es ist sehr beängstigend“, sagte Ortiz, der mit Cleo zusammenarbeitet, einer Interessenvertretung für den Klimawandel. „Mein Sohn ist 11 und meine Tochter neun, also sind sie jung, aber ich denke an ihre Zukunft. Werden sie ihre Kinder in Miami so großziehen können, wie ich den Luxus hatte, meine großzuziehen?“ Richard Luscombe in Miami Methodik Hochwasserkarten wurden unter Verwendung von Schätzungen des Meeresspiegelanstiegs von Climate Central und digitalen Höhendaten erstellt.

9874bc11	In einer abgelegenen Region der Antarktis, bekannt als Pine Island Bay, 2.500 Meilen von der Spitze Südamerikas entfernt, halten zwei Gletscher die menschliche Zivilisation als Geiseln. Diese Gletscher mit den Namen Pine Island und Thwaites erstrecken sich über eine gefrorene Ebene von mehr als 150 Meilen Länge und marschieren seit Jahrtausenden stetig in Richtung Amundsensee, einem Teil des riesigen Südlichen Ozeans. Weiter im Landesinneren erweitern sich die Gletscher zu einer zwei Meilen dicken Eisreserve, die eine Fläche von der Größe von Texas bedeckt. Es besteht kein Zweifel, dass dieses Eis schmelzen wird, wenn sich die Welt erwärmt. Die entscheidende Frage ist, wann. Die Gletscher der Pine Island Bay sind zwei der größten und am schnellsten schmelzenden in der Antarktis. (Ein Rolling-Stone-Feature Anfang dieses Jahres mit dem Titel Thwaites „The Doomsday Glacier“.) Zusammen wirken sie wie ein Stopfen, der genug Eis zurückhält, um 11 Fuß Meeresspiegelanstieg in die Weltmeere zu gießen – eine Menge, die jede Küstenstadt unter Wasser setzen würde auf dem Planeten. Aus diesem Grund ist es heute eine der wichtigsten wissenschaftlichen Fragen der Welt, herauszufinden, wie schnell diese Gletscher kollabieren werden. Um das herauszufinden, haben Wissenschaftler bis zum Ende der letzten Eiszeit vor etwa 11.000 Jahren zurückgeblickt, als die globalen Temperaturen ungefähr auf dem heutigen Niveau lagen. Die schlechten Nachrichten? Es gibt immer mehr Beweise dafür, dass die Gletscher der Pine Island Bay damals schnell zusammenbrachen und die Küsten der Welt überschwemmten – teilweise das Ergebnis von etwas, das als „Meeres-Eisklippen-Instabilität“ bezeichnet wird. Der Meeresboden wird in Richtung Zentrum dieses Teils der Antarktis tiefer, sodass jeder neue Eisberg, der abbricht, immer höhere Klippen freilegt. Eis wird so schwer, dass diese höheren Klippen ihr eigenes Gewicht nicht tragen können. Sobald sie zu bröckeln beginnen, wäre die Zerstörung nicht mehr aufzuhalten. „Eis ist nur so stark, dass es zusammenbricht, wenn diese Klippen eine bestimmte Höhe erreichen“, erklärt Kristin Poinar, Glaziologin am Goddard Space Flight Center der NASA. „Wir müssen wissen, wie schnell es geht.“ In den letzten Jahren haben Wissenschaftler die Instabilität mariner Eisklippen als eine Rückkopplungsschleife identifiziert, die den Zerfall der gesamten westantarktischen Eisdecke in diesem Jahrhundert in Gang setzen könnte – viel schneller als bisher angenommen. Minute für Minute bröckelten riesige, wolkenkratzergroße Eisklippen ins Meer, so hoch wie die Freiheitsstatue und so tief unter Wasser wie die Höhe des Empire State Building. Das Ergebnis: eine globale Katastrophe, wie wir sie noch nie erlebt haben. Eis kommt in vielen Formen vor, mit unterschiedlichen Folgen, wenn es schmilzt. Treibendes Eis, wie es im Winter den Arktischen Ozean bedeckt und aus Schelfeis besteht, erhöht den Meeresspiegel nicht. (Denken Sie an einen schmelzenden Eiswürfel, der nicht dazu führt, dass ein Getränk überläuft.) Eis an Land hingegen ist viel problematischer. Wenn es in den Ozean fällt, trägt es zum Gesamtvolumen der Flüssigkeit in den Meeren bei. Also Anstieg des Meeresspiegels. Die Antarktis ist eine riesige Landmasse – etwa halb so groß wie Afrika – und das Eis, das sie bedeckt, ist im Durchschnitt mehr als eine Meile dick. Bevor die menschliche Verbrennung fossiler Brennstoffe die globale Erwärmung auslöste, befand sich das Eis des Kontinents in einem relativen Gleichgewicht: Der Schnee im Inneren des Kontinents entsprach ungefähr den Eisbergen, die sich an seinen Rändern von den Gletschern lösten. Jetzt, da Kohlendioxid mehr Wärme in der Atmosphäre einfängt und den Planeten erwärmt, ist die Waage umgekippt. Ein totaler Zusammenbruch von Pine Island und Thwaites würde eine Katastrophe auslösen. Riesige Eisberge würden wie eine Parade gefrorener Soldaten aus der Antarktis strömen. Überall auf der Welt würden Fluten höher kriechen, langsam jede Küstenlinie auf dem Planeten begraben, Küstenstädte überfluten und Hunderte Millionen Klimaflüchtlinge schaffen. All dies könnte sich in nur 20 bis 50 Jahren abspielen – viel zu schnell, als dass sich die Menschheit anpassen könnte. „Aufgrund der Instabilität der Meereisklippen wird der Meeresspiegelanstieg im nächsten Jahrhundert möglicherweise viel größer sein, als wir vor fünf oder zehn Jahren angenommen haben“, sagt Poinar. Viele dieser neu entdeckten Bedenken werden von der Forschung zweier Klimatologen vorangetrieben: Rob DeConto von der University of Massachusetts-Amherst und David Pollard von der Penn State University. Eine Studie, die sie letztes Jahr veröffentlichten, war die erste, die die neuesten Erkenntnisse über die Instabilität mariner Eisklippen in ein kontinentales Modell der Antarktis einfließen ließ. Ihre Ergebnisse trieben Schätzungen darüber, wie hoch die Meere in diesem Jahrhundert ansteigen könnten, deutlich nach oben. „Antarktis-Modell verspricht unaufhaltsamen Eiskollaps“, lautete die Schlagzeile im Wissenschaftsjournal Nature, einer Publikation, die nicht für Übertreibungen bekannt ist. Statt eines Anstiegs des Meeresspiegels um drei Fuß bis zum Ende des Jahrhunderts war nach den Erkenntnissen von DeConto und Pollard ein Anstieg um sechs Fuß wahrscheinlicher. Aber wenn die Kohlenstoffemissionen weiterhin einem Worst-Case-Szenario ähneln, könnten die gesamten 11 Fuß Eis, die in der Westantarktis eingeschlossen sind, freigegeben werden, wie ihre Studie zeigte. Ein Anstieg des Meeresspiegels um drei Fuß wäre schlecht und würde zu häufigeren Überschwemmungen von US-Städten wie New Orleans, Houston, New York und Miami führen. Die pazifischen Inselstaaten wie die Marshallinseln würden den größten Teil ihres Territoriums verlieren. Leider sieht es jetzt so aus, als wären drei Fuß nur in den rosigsten Szenarien möglich. Bei einer Höhe von 1,80 m würden jedoch rund 12 Millionen Menschen in den Vereinigten Staaten vertrieben, und die am stärksten gefährdeten Megastädte der Welt wie Shanghai, Mumbai und Ho-Chi-Minh-Stadt könnten von der Landkarte getilgt werden. Bei 11 Fuß würde Land, das derzeit von Hunderten Millionen Menschen weltweit bewohnt wird, unter Wasser geraten. Südflorida wäre weitgehend unbewohnbar; Überschwemmungen in der Größenordnung von Hurrikan Sandy würden New York und New Jersey zweimal im Monat treffen, da allein der Zug des Mondes ausreichen würde, um Flutwasser in Häuser und Gebäude zu schicken. Der Durchbruch von DeConto und Pollard kam von dem Versuch, Beobachtungen alter Meeresspiegel an Küsten auf der ganzen Welt mit dem aktuellen Verhalten der Eisschilde abzugleichen. Vor etwa 3 Millionen Jahren, als die globalen Temperaturen ungefähr so ​​warm waren, wie sie später in diesem Jahrhundert erwartet werden, waren die Ozeane Dutzende von Fuß höher als heute. Frühere Modelle gingen davon aus, dass es Hunderte oder Tausende von Jahren dauern würde, bis ein Anstieg des Meeresspiegels in dieser Größenordnung eintritt. Aber sobald sie die Instabilität der Meereseisklippen berücksichtigten, deutete das Modell von DeConto und Pollard auf eine Katastrophe hin, wenn die Welt ihren „Business-as-usual“-Pfad beibehält – was bedeutet, dass wir die CO2-Emissionen nicht dramatisch reduzieren. Rasche Reduzierungen der Treibhausgase zeigten jedoch, dass die Antarktis über Hunderte von Jahren fast vollständig intakt blieb. Pollard und DeConto sind die ersten, die zugeben, dass ihr Modell immer noch roh ist, aber seine Ergebnisse haben die gesamte wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft in den Notfallmodus versetzt. „Es könnte schneller oder langsamer passieren, ich glaube, wir wissen es noch nicht wirklich“, sagt Jeremy Bassis, ein führender Eisschild-Wissenschaftler an der University of Michigan. „Aber es liegt im Bereich des Möglichen, und das ist irgendwie beängstigend.“ Früher dachten Wissenschaftler, dass Eisschilde Jahrtausende brauchen könnten, um auf Klimaveränderungen zu reagieren. Schließlich handelt es sich um kilometerdicke Eisbrocken. Die neuen Beweise besagen jedoch, dass, sobald eine bestimmte Temperaturschwelle erreicht ist, Schelfeis von Gletschern, die sich ins Meer erstrecken, wie die in der Nähe von Pine Island Bay, sowohl von oben als auch von unten zu schmelzen beginnen, was ihre Struktur schwächt und ihren Untergang beschleunigt und ebnen den Weg für die Instabilität von Eisklippen. In einer neuen Studie, die letzten Monat in der Zeitschrift Nature veröffentlicht wurde, weist ein Team von Wissenschaftlern aus Cambridge und Schweden auf Beweise aus Tausenden von Kratzern hin, die alte Eisberge auf dem Meeresboden hinterlassen haben. Dies deutet darauf hin, dass die Gletscher von Pine Island am Ende der letzten Eiszeit in relativ kurzer Zeit zersplittert sind. Der einzige Ort auf der Welt, an dem Sie heute die Instabilität von Eisklippen in Aktion sehen können, ist der Jakobshavn-Gletscher in Grönland, einer der am schnellsten kollabierenden Gletscher der Welt. DeConto sagt, dass sie, um ihr Modell zu konstruieren, die Einsturzrate von Jakobshavn nahmen, sie halbierten, um besonders konservativ zu sein, und sie dann auf Thwaites und Pine Island anwendeten. Aber es gibt Grund zu der Annahme, dass Thwaites und Pine Island noch schneller sein könnten als Jakobshavn. Im Moment schützt ein schwimmendes Schelfeis die beiden Gletscher und hilft dabei, den Eisfluss ins Meer zurückzuhalten. Aber neuere Beispiele aus anderen Regionen, wie das schnell kollabierende Larsen-B-Schelfeis auf der Antarktischen Halbinsel, zeigen, dass, sobald Schelfeis infolge der Erwärmung auseinanderbricht, ihre Muttergletscher beginnen, schneller in Richtung Meer zu fließen, ein Effekt, der das schwächen kann Stabilität des Eises auch weiter im Landesinneren. „Wenn Sie das Schelfeis entfernen, besteht die Möglichkeit, dass nicht nur Instabilitäten der Eisklippen auftreten, sondern auch ein Prozess, der als Instabilität der marinen Eisschilde bezeichnet wird“, sagt Matthew Wise, Polarwissenschaftler an der Universität Cambridge. Dies signalisiert die mögliche rasche Destabilisierung der gesamten westantarktischen Eisdecke in diesem Jahrhundert. „Sobald die Spannungen die Stärke des Eises übersteigen“, sagt Wise, „fällt es einfach ab.“ Und es ist nicht nur Pine Island Bay. Auf unserem aktuellen Kurs werden andere Gletscher rund um die Antarktis ähnlich anfällig sein. Und dann ist da noch Grönland, das bis zu 20 Fuß zum Anstieg des Meeresspiegels beitragen könnte, wenn es schmilzt. Neben einem Meteoriteneinschlag ist der schnelle Anstieg des Meeresspiegels durch einstürzende Eisklippen eine der schnellsten Möglichkeiten, wie sich unsere Welt neu gestalten kann. Das ist ungefähr so ​​schnell wie der Klimawandel. Dennoch sind einige Wissenschaftler nicht ganz davon überzeugt, dass der Alarm gerechtfertigt ist. Ted Scambos, leitender Wissenschaftler am National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado, sagt, die neue Forschung von Wise und seinen Kollegen, die vor 11.000 Jahren Instabilitäten der Eisklippen in der Pine Island Bay identifizierte, sei „verlockender Beweis“. Aber er sagt, dass die Forschung nicht feststellt, wie schnell es passiert ist. „Es gibt noch viel mehr zu verstehen, wenn wir diesen Mechanismus verwenden, um vorherzusagen, wie weit sich der Thwaites-Gletscher und die anderen Gletscher zurückziehen werden“, sagt er. „Die Frage läuft darauf hinaus, was sind die Bremsen dieses Prozesses?“ Scambos hält es für unwahrscheinlich, dass Thwaites oder Pine Island auf einmal zusammenbrechen würden. Zum einen würde ein schneller Zusammenbruch einen Haufen Eisberge hervorbringen, die wie ein vorübergehendes Schelfeis wirken und die Rückzugsrate verlangsamen könnten. Trotz der Meinungsverschiedenheiten wächst jedoch die Einigkeit innerhalb der wissenschaftlichen Gemeinschaft, dass wir viel mehr tun müssen, um das Risiko eines schnellen Meeresspiegelanstiegs zu bestimmen. Im Jahr 2015 begannen die Regierungen der USA und Großbritanniens, ein seltenes und dringendes gemeinsames Forschungsprogramm zur Untersuchung des Thwaites-Gletschers zu planen. Das Projekt mit dem Titel „Wie viel, wie schnell?“ soll Anfang nächsten Jahres beginnen und fünf Jahre laufen. Zu sehen, wie die beiden Regierungen ihre Ressourcen bündeln, ist „wirklich ein Zeichen für die Bedeutung solcher Forschung“, sagt Poinar von der NASA. Angesichts dessen, was auf dem Spiel steht, reicht das Forschungsprogramm bei Thwaites nicht aus, aber es könnte das Beste sein, was Forscher bekommen können. „Realistisch gesehen ist das wahrscheinlich alles, was in den nächsten fünf Jahren im aktuellen Finanzierungsumfeld getan werden kann“, sagt Pollard. Er bezieht sich natürlich auf die Missachtung der Wissenschaft und der angemessenen wissenschaftlichen Finanzierung durch die Trump-Administration; Der Haushaltsvorschlag des Weißen Hauses für 2018 enthält die allererste Kürzung der National Science Foundation, die normalerweise die Forschung in der Antarktis finanziert. „Aus meiner Sicht wäre es sinnvoll, hier einen enormen Aufwand zu betreiben“, sagt Pollard. Bauingenieure müssen die wichtigsten Gletscher der Antarktis untersuchen, als würden sie ein Gebäude analysieren, sagt er, nach Schwachstellen suchen und verstehen, wie genau sie versagen könnten. „Wenn Sie die Forschung jetzt stark ausweiten, wären [die Kosten] immer noch trivial im Vergleich zu den Verlusten, die passieren könnten.“ Bassis, der Eisschild-Wissenschaftler an der University of Michigan, beschrieb erstmals den theoretischen Prozess der Instabilität mariner Eisklippen in einer erst vor wenigen Jahren veröffentlichten Forschung. Er ist 40 Jahre alt, aber sein Fachgebiet hat sich im Laufe seiner Karriere bereits enorm verändert. Als Bassis 2002 seine Doktorarbeit in einer anderen Region der Antarktis durchführte, war er schockiert, als er in sein Basislager zurückkehrte und erfuhr, dass das Larsen-B-Schelfeis praktisch über Nacht verschwunden war. „Jede Überarbeitung unseres Verständnisses hat gezeigt, dass sich Eisschilde schneller ändern können, als wir dachten“, sagt er. „Wir haben nicht vorhergesagt, dass sich Pine Island zurückziehen würde, wir haben nicht vorhergesagt, dass Larsen B sich auflösen würde. Wir neigen dazu, uns diese Dinge anzusehen, nachdem sie passiert sind.“ Es gibt ein wiederkehrendes Thema in den Ergebnissen dieser Wissenschaftler in der Antarktis: Was wir jetzt tun, wird bestimmen, wie schnell Pine Island und Thwaites zusammenbrechen. Eine rasche Abkehr von fossilen Brennstoffen in den nächsten Jahrzehnten könnte ausreichen, um den raschen Anstieg des Meeresspiegels um Jahrhunderte hinauszuzögern. Das ist eine Entscheidung, die unzählige Billionen Dollar und Millionen von Menschenleben wert ist. „Die Bandbreite der Ergebnisse“, sagt Bassis, „hängt wirklich von den Entscheidungen ab, die die Menschen treffen.“ Eine solche Berichterstattung ist nur dank der großzügigen Unterstützung von Lesern wie Ihnen möglich.

Wissenschaftler versuchen zu verstehen, was mit dem Ross-Schelfeis – und dem Rest der Antarktis – passiert, während sich der Planet um ihn herum erwärmt. Sie versuchen, die Dicke des Eises und die Form des Meeresbodens darunter zu kartieren, um abzuschätzen, wie anfällig der Schelf für einen Einsturz sein könnte und wie schnell dies passieren könnte. Wissenschaftler versuchen auch, die Rolle des vom Menschen verursachten Klimawandels bei der Schwächung einiger Teile der westantarktischen Eisdecke zu messen und zu ergründen, wie schädlich die Meere rund um den Kontinent sein könnten, wenn sie sich im Laufe der Zeit erwärmen. Der Rand des Ross-Schelfeises. Die Antworten haben tiefgreifende Auswirkungen auf die Menschheit. In den Worst-Case-Computersimulationen der Wissenschaftler wird die anhaltende globale Erwärmung das Ross-Schelfeis bereits ab Mitte dieses Jahrhunderts schwächen und zum Einsturz bringen. Im Moment funktioniert das Regal wie ein riesiger Flaschenverschluss, der Eis verlangsamt, das versucht, vom Land ins Meer zu fließen. Wenn es zusammenbricht, könnte das Eis schneller in den Ozean fließen, ein Effekt, der in viel kleinerem Umfang bereits in anderen Gebieten der Antarktis aufgetreten ist. Die am stärksten gefährdeten Teile der westantarktischen Eisdecke könnten den Meeresspiegel um 10 bis 15 Fuß anheben und viele der Küstenstädte der Welt überschwemmen, obwohl die meisten Wissenschaftler glauben, dass dies weit über ein Jahrhundert oder vielleicht länger dauern würde. Sie befürchten einen möglichen Anstieg von bis zu zwei Metern bis zum Ende dieses Jahrhunderts. Ob sich diese alarmierenden Prognosen letztendlich als richtig erweisen, hängt teilweise von der Form des Meeresbodens unter dem Schelfeis ab und insbesondere davon, ob er tiefe Kanäle hat, die das sich erwärmende Meerwasser unter das Schelfeis leiten und den westantarktischen Eisschild von unten angreifen können . Eine andere Unterwassertopographie – zum Beispiel hohe Felskämme – kann wärmeres Wasser fernhalten und die Eisdecke möglicherweise für Hunderte von Jahren stabilisieren. „Wir hoffen herauszufinden, wie warmes Wasser an den Rand der Eisdecke gelangen kann“, sagte Robin E. Bell, Leiter des Labors der Columbia University, das Ende letzten Jahres ein Team entsandte, um das Ross-Schelfeis zu untersuchen. „Was sind das für versteckte Wege, auf denen es gehen kann?“ Als sie im Dezember über die weite weiße Landschaft hin und her flogen, verwendeten die Columbia-Wissenschaftler einige der fortschrittlichsten geophysikalischen Instrumente der Welt, um in und unter das Eis zu sehen. Während der stundenlangen Flüge wechselten sich die Wissenschaftler mit Nickerchen, Stricken oder kaltem Pizzaessen ab, aber zu jeder Zeit behielt jemand die Instrumente genau im Auge. Kirsty J. Tinto, die Wissenschaftlerin, die das Feldteam leitete, sah gerne zu, wie die Messungen die Illusion beseitigten, das Eis sei nur ein flacher, langweiliger Pfannkuchen. „Man schneidet es durch und sieht tausend Jahre Geschichte, hundert Millionen Jahre Geschichte“, sagte sie. Kirsty J. Tinto steigt aus einer LC-130 Hercules auf dem Ross-Schelfeis. Das Ross-Schelfeis scheint jetzt stabil zu sein, daher wird das Columbia-Projekt in etwa wie eine Basis-Röntgenaufnahme eines Arztes funktionieren – ein Ausgangspunkt für Vergleiche, wenn sich das Eis zu verschlechtern beginnt. Satellitenbeweise deuten darauf hin, dass dies bereits in anderen Teilen der Westantarktis geschieht, und viele Wissenschaftler glauben, dass relativ warmes Meerwasser der Schuldige ist. „Es ist eine Art Lötlampe an der Unterseite des Schelfeises“, sagte Robert A. Bindschadler, ein pensionierter NASA-Klimawissenschaftler. Aber die Geschichte ist nicht einfach, und das wärmere Wasser, das das Eis angreift, wurde nicht mit der globalen Erwärmung in Verbindung gebracht – zumindest nicht direkt. Die Winde rund um den Kontinent scheinen stärker zu werden, den Ozean aufzuwirbeln und eine Schicht wärmeren Wassers hochzubringen, die höchstwahrscheinlich seit Jahrhunderten dort ist. Sind diese stärkeren Winde mit der vom Menschen verursachten globalen Erwärmung verbunden? Einige Wissenschaftler glauben das, andere sagen, der Fall sei unbewiesen. „Wir sind uns nicht sicher, weil wir nicht lange genug Daten haben, um Signale von Rauschen zu trennen“, sagte Eric J. Steig, ein Wissenschaftler an der University of Washington, der Temperaturtrends in der Antarktis untersucht hat. Obwohl die Rolle der globalen Erwärmung jetzt unklar ist, wird sie wahrscheinlich in relativ naher Zukunft ein Faktor sein. Viele Experten glauben, dass wärmere Lufttemperaturen das Eis der Westantarktis von oben schwächen könnten, selbst wenn wärmeres Ozeanwasser es von unten angreift. Das wärmere Wasser scheint einer Reihe von Gletschern, die in eine Region der Westantarktis namens Amundsensee münden, den größten Schaden zuzufügen. Satelliten haben dort den schnellsten Eisverlust festgestellt und eine entscheidende Frage aufgeworfen: Hat ein unaufhaltsamer Kollaps des Eisschildes bereits begonnen? Ross-Schelfeis Pine-Island-Gletscher Thwaites-Gletscher Rossmeer Amundsenmeer Pine-Island-Gletscher Thwaites-Gletscher Amundsenmeer Rote Gebiete haben seit 2010 erhebliche Mengen an Eis verloren Basen. In Zusammenarbeit planen die beiden Länder, zig Millionen Dollar für bessere Messungen dort auszugeben, nachdem sie entschieden haben, dass es unerlässlich ist, mit der Beantwortung von Fragen über den möglichen Zusammenbruch der Region zu beginnen. Wissenschaftler müssen zum Beispiel viel mehr über den Boden unter den Gletschern dort wissen. Ist es schlüpfriger Schlamm, der das Eis viel schneller fließen lässt, oder hartes Gestein, das das Eis selbst in einer wärmeren Welt verlangsamen kann? „Was wir wissen müssen, sind wirklich die Details dessen, was dort passiert, wo Eis, Ozean und Land zusammenkommen“, sagte Ted A. Scambos, ein Wissenschaftler der University of Colorado, der bei der Planung der gemeinsamen Forschungsanstrengungen hilft. Die Entschlüsselung der Antworten und ein besseres Verständnis dafür, wie das Eis der Antarktis in der Vergangenheit zu- und abgenommen hat, kann einen groben Leitfaden für die Veränderungen bieten, die die vom Menschen verursachte globale Erwärmung in der Zukunft bewirken könnte. Wissenschaftler wissen bereits genug, um sich Sorgen zu machen. Vor etwa 120.000 Jahren, vor der letzten Eiszeit, durchlief der Planet eine natürliche Warmzeit mit ähnlichen Temperaturen wie in den kommenden Jahrzehnten. Der Meeresspiegel war 20 bis 30 Fuß höher als heute, was darauf hindeutet, dass die Eisschilde sowohl in Grönland als auch in der Antarktis teilweise zerfallen sein müssen, eine Warnung vor dem, was in relativ naher Zukunft passieren könnte, wenn die Erwärmung des Planeten unkontrolliert anhält. Einige Untersuchungen deuten jedoch darauf hin, dass eine Katastrophe möglicherweise noch nicht unvermeidlich ist. In einer Studie aus dem vergangenen Jahr nutzten Robert M. DeConto von der University of Massachusetts, Amherst, und David Pollard von der Pennsylvania State University ihr Computermodell, um vorherzusagen, was passieren würde, wenn die Emissionen im Einklang mit dem internationalen Klima in den nächsten Jahrzehnten stark reduziert würden Tore. Unter den ehrgeizigsten Szenarien fanden sie eine hohe Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass die Antarktis ziemlich stabil bleiben würde. „Es besteht immer noch die Möglichkeit, dass die Hölle losbricht“, sagte Dr. DeConto. „Aber das Modell deutet darauf hin, dass es einen Weg gibt, das Risiko eines großen Anstiegs des Meeresspiegels in der Antarktis zu verringern.“	Kilometerlanges Eis, das ins Meer stürzt	true
7f8bf578	Präsident Trump hat manchmal behauptet, dass Wissenschaftler an einem weltweiten Schwindel beteiligt sind, um die Öffentlichkeit zu täuschen, oder dass die globale Erwärmung von China erfunden wurde, um die amerikanische Industrie lahmzulegen. Die Argumente der Klimaleugner sind so angespannt, dass sich sogar Öl- und Kohleunternehmen öffentlich distanzieren, obwohl einige immer noch dazu beitragen, die Kampagnen von Politikern zu finanzieren, die solche Ansichten vertreten. Anstatt über die Klimaschutzpolitik zu verhandeln und zu versuchen, sie marktorientierter zu gestalten, haben einige politische Konservative den Ansatz gewählt, sie zu blockieren, indem sie versuchen, die Wissenschaft zu untergraben. Theoretisch könnten sie es sein. Wenn die Sonne zum Beispiel anfangen würde, mehr Strahlung auszusenden, würde das die Erde definitiv erwärmen. Aber Wissenschaftler haben sich die natürlichen Faktoren, von denen bekannt ist, dass sie die Planetentemperatur beeinflussen, genau angesehen und festgestellt, dass sie sich nicht annähernd genug ändern. Die Erwärmung ist auf der geologischen Zeitskala extrem schnell, und kein anderer Faktor kann sie so gut erklären wie menschliche Emissionen von Treibhausgasen. Könnten natürliche Faktoren die Ursache für die Erwärmung sein? 5. Könnten natürliche Faktoren die Ursache der Erwärmung sein? Harte Beweise, einschließlich Studien, die Radioaktivität verwenden, um industrielle Emissionen von natürlichen Emissionen zu unterscheiden, zeigen, dass das zusätzliche Gas von menschlicher Aktivität stammt. Der Kohlendioxidgehalt stieg und fiel in der längst vergangenen Zeit auf natürliche Weise, aber diese Veränderungen dauerten Tausende von Jahren. Geologen sagen, dass Menschen das Gas jetzt viel schneller in die Luft pumpen, als es die Natur jemals getan hat. Woher wissen wir, dass der Mensch für den Anstieg des Kohlendioxids verantwortlich ist? 4. Woher wissen wir, dass der Mensch für den Anstieg des Kohlendioxids verantwortlich ist? Melden Sie sich an, um unseren ausführlichen Journalismus über den Klimawandel auf der ganzen Welt zu erhalten. Im 19. Jahrhundert entdeckten Wissenschaftler, dass bestimmte Gase in der Luft Wärme einfangen und verlangsamen, die sonst in den Weltraum entweichen würde. Kohlendioxid ist ein wichtiger Akteur; Ohne etwas davon in der Luft wäre die Erde eine gefrorene Einöde. Die erste Vorhersage, dass sich der Planet erwärmen würde, wenn Menschen mehr Gas freisetzen, wurde 1896 gemacht. Das Gas hat sich bis jetzt um 43 Prozent gegenüber dem vorindustriellen Niveau erhöht, und die Erde hat sich ungefähr um den Betrag erwärmt, den Wissenschaftler vorausgesagt hatten. Wir wissen es seit mehr als einem Jahrhundert. Wirklich. Was ist der Treibhauseffekt und wie verursacht er die globale Erwärmung? 3. Was ist der Treibhauseffekt und wie verursacht er die globale Erwärmung? Anfang 2017 hatte sich die Erde seit 1880, als die Aufzeichnungen auf globaler Ebene begannen, um etwa 2 Grad Fahrenheit (mehr als 1 Grad Celsius) erwärmt. Die Zahl mag niedrig klingen, aber als Durchschnitt über die Oberfläche eines ganzen Planeten ist sie tatsächlich hoch, was erklärt, warum ein Großteil des Landeises der Welt zu schmelzen beginnt und die Ozeane immer schneller ansteigen. Wenn die Treibhausgasemissionen unkontrolliert weitergehen, könnte die globale Erwärmung nach Ansicht von Wissenschaftlern letztendlich 8 Grad Fahrenheit überschreiten, was die Fähigkeit des Planeten untergraben würde, eine große menschliche Bevölkerung zu ernähren. Präsident Trump hat behauptet, Wissenschaftler hätten aufgehört, sich auf die globale Erwärmung zu beziehen, und angefangen, sie Klimawandel zu nennen, weil „das Wetter im Winter so kalt war“. Aber die Behauptung ist falsch. Wissenschaftler verwenden beide Begriffe seit Jahrzehnten. Sie können sich die globale Erwärmung als eine Art des Klimawandels vorstellen. Der breitere Begriff umfasst Veränderungen jenseits wärmerer Temperaturen, wie z. B. wechselnde Niederschlagsmuster. Beide sind korrekt, bedeuten aber unterschiedliche Dinge. In vielen anderen Fällen – zum Beispiel Hurrikans – ist die Verbindung bestimmter Trends mit der globalen Erwärmung ungewiss oder umstritten. Wissenschaftler verbessern allmählich ihr Verständnis, da Computeranalysen des Klimas immer leistungsfähiger werden. Wissenschaftler haben starke Beweise dafür veröffentlicht, dass das sich erwärmende Klima Hitzewellen häufiger und intensiver macht. Es verursacht auch stärkere Regenstürme, und Küstenüberschwemmungen werden schlimmer, da die Ozeane aufgrund menschlicher Emissionen ansteigen. Die globale Erwärmung hat Dürren in Regionen wie dem Nahen Osten verstärkt und möglicherweise eine kürzliche Dürre in Kalifornien verstärkt. Das Risiko besteht darin, dass die Rate noch weiter steigt. Wissenschaftler, die die Erdgeschichte studieren, sagen, dass das Wasser im schlimmsten Fall um einen Fuß pro Jahrzehnt steigen könnte, obwohl das unwahrscheinlich erscheint. Viele Experten glauben, dass selbst wenn die Emissionen morgen gestoppt werden, ein Anstieg des Meeresspiegels um 15 oder 20 Fuß bereits unvermeidlich ist, genug, um viele Städte zu überfluten, wenn nicht Billionen von Dollar für ihren Schutz ausgegeben werden. Wie lange es dauern wird, ist unklar. Aber wenn die Emissionen weiter steigen, könnte der ultimative Anstieg 80 oder 100 Fuß betragen. Der Ozean hat sich beschleunigt und steigt jetzt mit einer Geschwindigkeit von etwa einem Fuß pro Jahrhundert an, was Regierungen und Grundstückseigentümer dazu zwingt, zig Milliarden Dollar für die Bekämpfung der Küstenerosion auszugeben. Aber wenn diese Rate anhält, wäre sie wahrscheinlich überschaubar, sagen Experten. Die einfache Realität ist, dass die Menschen die Auswirkungen bereits spüren, ob sie es wissen oder nicht. Aufgrund des Anstiegs des Meeresspiegels wurden etwa 83.000 Einwohner von New York und New Jersey während des Hurrikans Sandy überschwemmt, als dies bei einem stabilen Klima der Fall gewesen wäre, haben Wissenschaftler berechnet. Zehntausende Menschen sterben bereits in Hitzewellen, die durch die globale Erwärmung noch verschlimmert werden. Die Flüchtlingsströme, die die Politik auf der ganzen Welt destabilisiert haben, sind zum Teil auf den Klimawandel zurückzuführen. Natürlich werden, wie bei fast allen anderen sozialen Problemen, die Armen zuerst und am härtesten getroffen. Wissenschaftler sagen, dass sich das Klima in den kommenden 25 oder 30 Jahren allmählich erwärmen wird, mit extremerem Wetter. Korallenriffe und andere sensible Lebensräume beginnen bereits zu sterben. Längerfristig, wenn die Emissionen ungebremst steigen, befürchten Wissenschaftler so schwerwiegende Klimaauswirkungen, dass sie Regierungen destabilisieren, Flüchtlingswellen hervorrufen, das sechste Massensterben von Pflanzen und Tieren in der Erdgeschichte auslösen und die polaren Eiskappen schmelzen könnten, wodurch die Meere schmelzen hoch genug steigen, um die meisten Küstenstädte der Welt zu überfluten. Die Emissionen, die diese Risiken verursachen, finden jetzt statt und werfen tiefe moralische Fragen für unsere Generation auf. 1. Gibt es realistische Lösungen für das Problem? Ja, aber der Wandel vollzieht sich zu langsam. Die Gesellschaft hat Maßnahmen so lange aufgeschoben, dass die Risiken jetzt schwerwiegend sind, sagen Wissenschaftler. Aber solange es noch unverbrannte fossile Brennstoffe im Boden gibt, ist es noch nicht zu spät zu handeln. Die Erwärmung wird sich nur dann auf ein möglicherweise kontrollierbares Tempo verlangsamen, wenn die menschlichen Emissionen auf Null reduziert werden. Die gute Nachricht ist, dass sie jetzt in vielen Ländern aufgrund von Programmen wie Kraftstoffsparstandards für Autos, strengeren Bauvorschriften und Emissionsgrenzwerten für Kraftwerke sinken. Experten sagen jedoch, dass die Energiewende drastisch beschleunigt werden muss, um die schlimmsten Auswirkungen des Klimawandels abzuwenden. 2. Was ist das Pariser Abkommen? Nahezu jedes Land hat zugestimmt, künftige Emissionen zu begrenzen. Die bahnbrechende Einigung wurde im Dezember 2015 außerhalb von Paris erzielt. Die Kürzungen sind freiwillig und die Zusagen reichen nicht aus, um schwerwiegende Auswirkungen abzuwenden. Aber das Abkommen soll alle paar Jahre überprüft werden, damit die Länder ihre Verpflichtungen erhöhen. Präsident Trump kündigte 2017 an, dass er die Vereinigten Staaten aus dem Abkommen herausziehen würde, obwohl dies Jahre dauern würde, und andere Länder sagten, sie würden ungeachtet der amerikanischen Absichten weitermachen. 3. Hilft oder schadet saubere Energie der Wirtschaft? Das Beschäftigungswachstum im Bereich Erneuerbare Energien ist stark. Zu den Energiequellen mit den niedrigsten Emissionen gehören Windturbinen, Sonnenkollektoren, Wasserkraftwerke und Kernkraftwerke. Kraftwerke, die Erdgas verbrennen, verursachen auch weniger Emissionen als solche, die Kohle verbrennen. Die Umstellung auf diese saubereren Quellen mag kurzfristig etwas kostspieliger sein, aber sie könnten sich letztendlich auszahlen, indem sie Klimaschäden abwenden und Gesundheitsprobleme im Zusammenhang mit verschmutzter Luft reduzieren. Und die Ausweitung des Marktes treibt die Kosten erneuerbarer Energien so schnell nach unten, dass sie schmutzige Energie am Ende vielleicht allein im Preis schlagen werden – in einigen Bereichen tut sie das bereits. Der Übergang zu sauberer Energie bringt sicherlich Verlierer wie Kohleunternehmen hervor, aber er schafft auch Arbeitsplätze. Die Solarindustrie in den Vereinigten Staaten beschäftigt inzwischen mehr als doppelt so viele Menschen wie der Kohlebergbau. 4. Was ist mit Fracking oder „sauberer Kohle“? Beides könnte helfen, das Energiesystem zu bereinigen. Hydraulic Fracturing oder „Fracking“ gehört zu einer Reihe von Bohrtechnologien, die dazu beigetragen haben, in den Vereinigten Staaten und einigen anderen Ländern eine neue Fülle von Erdgas zu fördern. Die Verbrennung von Gas anstelle von Kohle in Kraftwerken reduziert kurzfristig die Emissionen, obwohl Gas immer noch ein fossiler Brennstoff ist und langfristig auslaufen muss. Auch das Fracking selbst kann zu lokaler Verschmutzung führen. „Saubere Kohle“ ist ein Ansatz, bei dem die Emissionen von Kohlekraftwerken aufgefangen und in den Untergrund gepumpt werden. Es muss noch bewiesen werden, dass es wirtschaftlich funktioniert, aber einige Experten glauben, dass es schließlich eine große Rolle spielen könnte. 5. Was gibt es Neues bei Elektroautos? Die Umsätze sind insgesamt noch klein, aber sie steigen schnell. Die Autos beziehen nachts Strom aus dem Stromnetz und geben tagsüber keine Schadstoffe ab, wenn sie durch die Stadt fahren. Sie sind von Natur aus effizienter als Benzinautos und würden einen Fortschritt darstellen, selbst wenn der Strom durch die Verbrennung von Kohle erzeugt würde, aber sie werden weitaus wichtiger, da das Stromnetz selbst durch erneuerbare Energien grüner wird. Die Autos verbessern sich so schnell, dass einige Länder bereits darüber sprechen, den Verkauf von Benzinautos nach 2030 zu verbieten. 6. Was sind CO2-Steuern, CO2-Handel und CO2-Ausgleich? Es ist nur ein Jargon, um der Umweltverschmutzung einen Preis zu geben. Die durch menschliche Aktivitäten freigesetzten Treibhausgase werden oft kurz als „Kohlenstoffemissionen“ bezeichnet. Denn zwei der wichtigsten Gase, Kohlendioxid und Methan, enthalten Kohlenstoff. (Einige andere Schadstoffe werden in die gleiche Kategorie eingeordnet, auch wenn sie eigentlich keinen Kohlenstoff enthalten.) Wenn Sie von Kohlenstoffsteuern, Kohlenstoffhandel und so weiter hören, sind dies nur Kurzbeschreibungen von Methoden, um einen Preis für Emissionen festzulegen, was Ökonomen sagen, ist einer der wichtigsten Schritte, die die Gesellschaft unternehmen könnte, um sie zu begrenzen. 7. Der Klimawandel scheint so überwältigend. Was kann ich persönlich dagegen tun? Beginnen Sie damit, dies mit 50 Ihrer Freunde zu teilen. Experten sagen, dass das Problem nur durch großangelegte, kollektive Maßnahmen gelöst werden kann. Ganze Staaten und Nationen müssen sich entscheiden, ihre Energiesysteme zu säubern, indem sie alle verfügbaren Mittel einsetzen und so schnell wie möglich handeln. Das Wichtigste, was Sie tun können, ist also, Ihre Rechte als Bürger wahrzunehmen, sich zu äußern und Veränderungen zu fordern. Sie können auch direkt persönlich Maßnahmen ergreifen, um Ihren CO2-Fußabdruck auf einfache Weise zu reduzieren, wodurch Sie Geld sparen. Sie können Lecks in Ihrer Hausisolierung stopfen, um Strom zu sparen, ein intelligentes Thermostat installieren, auf effizientere Glühbirnen umsteigen, ungenutzte Lichter ausschalten, weniger Kilometer fahren, indem Sie Fahrten konsolidieren oder öffentliche Verkehrsmittel nutzen, weniger Lebensmittel verschwenden und weniger Fleisch essen. Ein oder zwei Flugreisen weniger pro Jahr können genauso viel Emissionen einsparen wie alle anderen Maßnahmen zusammen. Wenn Sie auf dem neuesten Stand sein wollen, können Sie sich überlegen, ein Elektro- oder Hybridauto zu kaufen oder Sonnenkollektoren auf Ihrem Dach anzubringen. Wenn Ihr Staat einen wettbewerbsfähigen Strommarkt hat, können Sie möglicherweise 100 Prozent grünen Strom kaufen. Führende Unternehmen, darunter große Hersteller wie Automobilhersteller, beginnen, saubere Energie für ihren Betrieb zu fordern. Sie können die Unternehmensrichtlinien beachten, die Unternehmen unterstützen, die die Führung übernehmen, und die anderen wissen lassen, dass Sie von ihnen erwarten, dass sie es besser machen.

6c7718b5	"Weltweite Temperaturrekorde wurden durch eine ungewöhnliche globale Hitzewelle erschüttert. Erstickende Hitze hat letzte Woche in ganz Großbritannien Straßen und Dächer zerbrochen, als Motherwell mit 33,2 °C (91,8 °F) die höchste jemals in Schottland gemessene Temperatur erreichte. Die Hitzewelle hat sich auf der ganzen Welt ausgebreitet, wobei Meteo France 21 Departements im ganzen Land in einen orangefarbenen Wetteralarm versetzt hat, während Oman die höchste Nachttemperatur verzeichnete, die jemals auf dem Planeten gemessen wurde. Mindestens acht Menschen wurden durch die drückende Hitze in Nordamerika getötet, wobei Montreal die heißeste Temperatur seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen verzeichnete. Schlimmer noch, die erstickenden Temperaturen werden voraussichtlich auf der Nordhalbkugel anhalten, haben Meteorologen gewarnt. Während eine isolierte Hitzewelle als Anomalie eingestuft werden kann, deutet das Ausmaß dieses Phänomens auf die globale Erwärmung als Schuldigen hin, sagten Wissenschaftler. Scrollen Sie nach unten für das Video Rekorde auf der ganzen Welt wurden gebrochen, als der gesamte Planet von einer bösartigen Hitzewelle erfasst wurde (Bild). Schwüle Zivilisten haben sich in der Sonne gesonnt, als Thermometer nie zuvor gesehene Temperaturen aufzeichnen. Montreal (im Bild) hat den bisherigen Rekord für die heißeste Temperatur der Stadt gebrochen, wie die Messwerte von Anfang dieser Woche von 97,9 ° F (36,6 ° C) auf Dauer zeigten und ungewöhnlich intensiver Sonneneinstrahlung hat ein Großteil der nördlichen Hemisphäre ungewöhnlich warme Temperaturen erlebt. Das Ausmaß dieses jüngsten Phänomens deutet darauf hin, dass die globale Erwärmung schuld ist, warnen Wissenschaftler. „Die Sommer werden immer heißer“, sagte Friederike Otto von der University of Oxford, die umfangreiche Recherchen zu Daten der Hitzewelle durchführte, die sich im Juni, Juli und August 2017 über Europa ausbreitete. „Hitzewellen sind weitaus intensiver als in der Zeit, in der meine Eltern aufgewachsen sind die 1950er. ""Wenn wir nichts tun, um unsere Treibhausgasemissionen zu reduzieren, wird die Art von extremer Hitze, die wir im vergangenen Sommer erlebt haben, die Norm sein, wenn mein kleiner Sohn ein erwachsener Mann ist."" Nordamerika hat einen erstaunlichen Temperaturanstieg erlebt. Es gibt bereits Berichte über mindestens acht hitzebedingte Todesfälle in Kanada und den Vereinigten Staaten, die bis zum vergangenen Wochenende zurückreichen, darunter sechs in Montreal. Letzterer brach den bisherigen Rekord für die heißeste Temperatur der Stadt, da Messwerte von Anfang dieser Woche zeigten, dass er 97,9 ° F (36,6 ° C) erreichte. Denver, die Hauptstadt des Bundesstaates Colorado, die bekanntermaßen eine Meile über dem Meeresspiegel liegt, verzeichnete letzte Woche ebenfalls eine Rekordtemperatur von 40,5 °C (105 °F). Das passt zu seinem früheren Allzeitrekord, der am 20. Juli 2005 aufgestellt wurde. Es wird angenommen, dass die Schar neuer Rekorde mit der intensiven Hitzekuppel verbunden ist, die seit Ende Juni den größten Teil der Vereinigten Staaten und des Südostens Kanadas verzehrt hat. Experten gehen davon aus, dass die Kuppel noch mindestens eine weitere Woche über dem Nordosten hängen wird, und sagen voraus, dass sie sich an diesem Wochenende nach Westen ausbreiten wird. Auf der anderen Seite des Atlantiks ist das Klima aufgrund der Abkühlung durch den Golfstrom normalerweise milder. Trotzdem scheint der Sommer 2018 einer der heißesten seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen zu werden. Schottland hat die heißeste Temperatur seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen erlebt, wobei das UK Met Office berichtete, dass Motherwell, das etwa 20 km südöstlich von Glasgow liegt, am 28. Juni 33,2 °C (91,8 °F) erreichte. Der bisherige schottische Rekord von 91,2 °F (32,9°C) wurde im August 2003 bei Greycrook eingestellt. Darüber hinaus hatte Glasgow mit 31,9 °C (89,4 °F) den heißesten Tag seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen. Auch über der Irischen See stiegen die Temperaturen trotz kühler Brisen vom Atlantik in die Höhe. Schottland, das mehr für seine Seen und kalten Winter als für seine glühenden Temperaturen bekannt ist, stellte seine wärmste Temperatur aller Zeiten auf, wobei das UK Met Office berichtete, dass Motherwell, etwa 20 km südöstlich von Glasgow, 33,2 °C (91,8 °F) erreichte 28. Juni Glasgow (im Bild) hatte seinen heißesten Tag seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen und erreichte 89,4 °F (31,9 °C). Über der Irischen See auf der Smaragdinsel stiegen die Temperaturen ebenfalls, obwohl kühle Brisen vom Atlantik herüberwehten, erreichte Belfast am 28. Juni einen neuen Rekord von 85,1 Grad (29,5 Grad Celsius), als Castlederg in Nordirland einen neuen Rekord für das Vereinigte Königreich aufstellte ganz, am nächsten Tag bei 86,2 ° F (30,1 ° C) enden. Die Meteorologin Emma Salter sagte gegenüber dem Daily Express: „Der Hochdruck über dem Land wird am Mittwoch und Donnerstag nachlassen, sodass es ein paar Grad frischer sein wird, leider wird dies kaum spürbar sein. „Es gibt ein weiteres Hochdruckgebiet, das später in dieser Woche die Oberhand gewinnen wird, und die Temperaturen werden zum Wochenende hin kriechen, wenn wir wieder auf 30 °C kommen könnten. „Es wird ein bisschen Wolken über dem Süden geben, wodurch es sich etwas kühler anfühlen könnte, aber das wird sich ziemlich schnell auflösen. „Dann sind wir wieder bei atemberaubend blauem Himmel und Sonnenschein und es gibt keine Anzeichen dafür, dass dieses Wetter bis Mitte Juli bricht, was ungewöhnlich ist. ""Der langfristige Trend geht dahin, dass überdurchschnittliche Temperaturen bis Ende Juli anhalten, mit nur ein paar veränderlichen Perioden in diesem Zeitraum."" Public Health England (PHE) hat in Bezug auf die ungewöhnliche Hitze eine Gesundheitswarnung der Stufe zwei herausgegeben. WIE HEISS WAR EUROPA IN DER HITZEWELLE? Übermäßige Hitze hat letzte Woche die britischen Inseln versengt. Die erstickende Hitze ließ Straßen und Dächer einknicken, berichtete der Weather Channel, und führte zu mehreren Rekordhöhen: Schottland stellte vorläufig seine heißeste Temperatur auf, als Motherwell am 28. Juni 91,8 ° F (33,2 ° C) erreichte. Der vorherige Rekord lag bei 32,9 Die im August 2003 in Greycrook In Irland eingestellte °C erreichte am 28. Juni mit 29,5 °C (85,1 °F) ebenfalls ein Rekordhoch. Shannon erreichte mit 32 °C (89,6 °F) auch seinen eigenen Rekord. In Nordirland erreichte Castlederg am 29. Juni 86,2 ° F (30,1 ° C), seinen Rekord. Auf der Ostseite des Atlantiks ist das Klima aufgrund des Golfstroms tendenziell milder. Trotzdem wird der Sommer 2018 zu einem der heißesten seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen. In der nahöstlichen Nation Oman lag die niedrigste Temperatur für 24 Stunden am 28. Juni in der Küstenstadt Quriyat bei 42,6 °C (108,7 °F). ). Zum Vergleich: In Washington DC war es noch nie heißer als 41 °C. In Irland erreichte Belfast am 28. Juni mit 29,5 °C (85,1 °F) ebenfalls ein Rekordhoch. Shannon erreichte 89,6 ° F (32 ° C), seinen Rekord. In Nordirland erreichte Castlederg am 29. Juni 86,2 ° F (30,1 ° C), sein Rekord. Es warnt: „Die Temperaturen werden voraussichtlich bis Mitte dieser Woche vorübergehend ein wenig Tag und Nacht sinken, bevor leichtere Winde höhere Temperaturen über mehr zulassen östlichen Gebiete Englands am Donnerstag und teilweise am Freitag. Diese Warnung wurde für die maximal mögliche Dauer ausgegeben. „Es ist sehr wahrscheinlich, dass es später in dieser Arbeitswoche für ähnliche Gebiete verlängert wird, da erwartet wird, dass sich die Hitze zum Wochenende hin und möglicherweise in der folgenden Woche aufbaut. ""Auch in Gebieten, die ihre Alarmkriterien nicht verletzen, lautet die Schlagzeile, dass es voraussichtlich weitgehend trocken, oft sonnig und zeitweise sehr warm bleiben wird."" Experten sagten am Wochenende, dass die Hitzewelle in Großbritannien voraussichtlich noch mindestens zwei Wochen andauern werde. Während die Inseln in Westeuropa in der Hitzewelle schwelten, sonnte sich auch Eurasien in einer Hitzewelle. Die Weite Nordamerikas weist große Unterschiede bei den Durchschnittstemperaturen auf, wobei die sonnenverwöhnten Einwohner von Texas und Florida viel mehr an 100 °F (37,7 °C) Hitze gewöhnt sind als die Einwohner nördlich der Grenze zwischen den USA und Kanada. Kanadische Kinder haben Montreals ungewöhnlich warmes Wetter genossen (im Bild) Denver, die Hauptstadt Colorados, die bekanntermaßen eine Meile über dem Meeresspiegel liegt, erreichte ebenfalls neue Höhen. Es erreichte Ende Juni seinen vorherigen Rekord von 40,5 ° C (105 ° F). Es wird angenommen, dass diese Rekorde von einer massiven und intensiven Hitzekuppel stammen, die seit letzter Woche den größten Teil der Vereinigten Staaten und Südostkanadas verzehrt hat DIE AMERIKA ERREICHEN WÄHREND DER JÜNGSTEN HITZEWELLE? Nordamerika weist normalerweise große Unterschiede bei den Durchschnittstemperaturen auf. Bundesstaaten in den USA und Kanada haben jedoch in der letzten Woche Rekordtemperaturen als Folge der globalen Erwärmung erlebt. Montreal hat seinen bisherigen Rekord für die heißeste Temperatur gebrochen, wie Messwerte von Anfang dieser Woche von 97,9 ° F (36,6 ° C) zeigten. Denver, die Hauptstadt des Bundesstaates Colorado, hat am 28. Juni in Burlington seinen Höchsttemperaturrekord von 105 ° C eingestellt Vermont verzeichnete seine bisher wärmste Tiefsttemperatur aller Zeiten und verzeichnete am 2. Juli innerhalb von 24 Stunden ein Tief von 27 ° C (80 ° F). Ottawa verzeichnete am 1. Juli seine extremste Kombination aus Hitze und Feuchtigkeit im ehemals sowjetischen Staat Armenien, stiegen die Temperaturen auf 42 °C (107,6 °F). Dies war der heißeste Tag des Landes im Juli und ist mit dem heißesten Tag aller Zeiten verbunden. Russland, das Gastgeberland der diesjährigen FIFA Fussball-Weltmeisterschaft, befindet sich ebenfalls inmitten einer Hitzewelle. Mehrere Orte im Süden des größten Landes der Welt erreichten oder übertrafen ihre wärmsten Juni-Temperaturen. Quriyat im Oman verzeichnete am 26. Juni mit 49 °C (121,6 °F) die höchste Nachttemperatur, die jemals auf der Erde gemessen wurde, und blieb damit nur zwei Grad hinter dem landesweiten Hitzerekord von 123,4 °C zurück °F (50,7 °C). Die neuesten Aufzeichnungen kommen Monate, nachdem Pakistan die heißeste Temperatur gemeldet hat, die jemals auf der Erde gesehen wurde. Die Sonne war so intensiv, dass sie das Quecksilber auf über 120 °F brachte, als es bei 122,4 °F (50,2 °C) seinen Höhepunkt erreichte. WIE HEISS IST EURASIEN UND DER MITTLERE OSTEN WÄHREND DER GLOBALEN HITZEWELLE? Während die Inseln in Westeuropa in ihrer eigenen Hitzewelle schwelten, brannte auch Eurasien. In Eriwan im ehemaligen Sowjetstaat Armenien stiegen die Temperaturen auf 42 °C (107,6 °F). Dies ist der heißeste Tag, der je im Juli gesehen wurde, und knüpft an den heißesten Tag aller Zeiten an. Auch Russland, das Gastgeberland der diesjährigen Fußballweltmeisterschaft, steckt mitten in einer Hitzewelle. Mehrere Orte im Süden des größten Landes der Welt erreichten oder übertrafen ihre wärmsten Juni-Temperaturen. In der nahöstlichen Nation Oman betrug die niedrigste Temperatur für 24 Stunden am 28. Juni 108,7 ° F (42,6 ° C) in der Küstenstadt Quriyat. Zum Vergleich: Washington DC war noch nie heißer als 41 °C. Das macht dies zum Tag mit den höchsten Tiefsttemperaturen in der aufgezeichneten Geschichte. Diese fantastischen Zahlen kommen nur wenige Monate, nachdem Pakistan die heißeste Temperatur verzeichnete, die jemals auf der Erde beobachtet wurde. Die Sonne war so intensiv, dass sie das Quecksilber auf über 120 °F brachte, als es bei 122,4 °F (50,2 °C) seinen Höhepunkt erreichte.

4d40e3aa	"YUKON DELTA NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, Alaska – Die Arktis erwärmt sich etwa doppelt so schnell wie andere Teile des Planeten, und selbst hier im subarktischen Alaska ist die Erwärmungsrate hoch. Meereis und Lebensraum für Wildtiere verschwinden; höhere Meeresspiegel bedrohen Küstendörfer. Aber für die Wissenschaftler des Woods Hole Research Center, die hierher gekommen sind, um die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels zu untersuchen, ist das Schicksal des Permafrostbodens, des immer gefrorenen Bodens, der einem Großteil des Staates zugrunde liegt, am dringendsten. Es beginnt nur wenige Meter unter der Oberfläche und erstreckt sich über Dutzende oder sogar Hunderte von Metern nach unten. Es enthält riesige Mengen an Kohlenstoff in organischer Substanz – Pflanzen, die vor Jahrhunderten Kohlendioxid aus der Atmosphäre aufgenommen haben, starben und erstarrten, bevor sie sich zersetzen konnten. Weltweit wird angenommen, dass Permafrost etwa doppelt so viel Kohlenstoff enthält wie derzeit in der Atmosphäre. Sobald dieses uralte organische Material auftaut, wandeln Mikroben einen Teil davon in Kohlendioxid und Methan um, die in die Atmosphäre strömen und noch mehr Erwärmung verursachen können. Wissenschaftler haben geschätzt, dass der Prozess des Auftauens des Permafrosts in den nächsten Jahrhunderten bis zu 1,7 Grad Fahrenheit zur globalen Erwärmung beitragen könnte, unabhängig davon, was die Gesellschaft tut, um die Emissionen aus der Verbrennung fossiler Brennstoffe und anderen Aktivitäten zu reduzieren. Nirgendwo in Alaska ist Permafrost gefährdeter als hier, 350 Meilen südlich des Polarkreises, in einer weiten, weitgehend baumlosen Landschaft, die aus Sedimenten besteht, die von zwei der größten Flüsse des Bundesstaates, dem Yukon und dem Kuskokwim, herabgebracht wurden. Temperaturen drei Fuß tief in den gefrorenen Boden sind weniger als ein halbes Grad unter dem Gefrierpunkt. Dieses Gebiet könnte bis Mitte des Jahrhunderts viel von seinem Permafrost verlieren. Das, so Max Holmes, leitender Wissenschaftler und stellvertretender Direktor des Forschungszentrums, „hat alle möglichen Konsequenzen sowohl lokal für diese Region, für die Tiere und die Menschen, die hier leben, als auch global.“ „Es ist ernüchternd, an diese großartige Landschaft zu denken und wie grundlegend sie sich in relativ kurzer Zeit verändern kann“, fügte er hinzu. Aber in dieser weiten, flachen Tundra braucht es ein geübtes Auge, um zu sehen, wie Alaska von unten auftaut. An einem der zahllosen kleinen Seen, die die Region übersäten, sind Teile der Küstenlinie, die ehemaligen Permafrost enthielten, in Richtung Wasser abgekalbt. In der Nähe, über einem schwammigen Bett aus Moosen und Flechten, bildete sich höchstwahrscheinlich eine kleine sumpfige Senke, als das Eis in den obersten Schichten des darunter liegenden Permafrosts zu Wasser schmolz. Auf dem Feld extrahieren Sarah Ludwig, eine wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin von Woods Hole (links), und eine Studentin, Laura Jardine, einen Kern aus Permafrost. Im Labor schneidet Ms. Jardine den Kern mit einer Säge. Stash Wislocki, mit Ausnahme des letzten Fotos, von John Schade Im Juli errichteten die Wissenschaftler von Woods Hole zusammen mit 13 Studenten und Doktoranden, die an eigenen Projekten arbeiteten, eine temporäre Feldstation an einem namenlosen See 60 Meilen nordwestlich von Bethel ist mit 6.000 Einwohnern die größte Stadt der Region. Sie bohrten Permafrostkerne mit einem Bohrer, entnahmen weitere Sediment- und Wasserproben und bauten Temperatursonden in den gefrorenen Boden ein. Später, zurück im Labor in Woods Hole, begannen sie damit, die Proben auf Kohlenstoffgehalt und Nährstoffe zu analysieren. Ziel ist es, besser zu verstehen, wie sich das Auftauen von Permafrost auf die Landschaft auswirkt und letztendlich, wie viel und welcher Mix an Treibhausgasen freigesetzt wird. „Um zu wissen, wie viel verloren geht, muss man wissen, wie viel da ist“, sagt Sue Natali, Wissenschaftlerin und Permafrost-Expertin aus Woods Hole. Sogar im kälteren Norden Alaskas, wo sich der Permafrost in einigen Teilen des Nordhangs mehr als 2.100 Fuß unter der Oberfläche erstreckt, sehen Wissenschaftler starke Veränderungen. Vladimir E. Romanovsky, ein Permafrostforscher an der University of Alaska, Fairbanks, sagte, dass die Temperaturen in einer Tiefe von 65 Fuß über Jahrzehnte um 3 Grad Celsius (etwa 5,5 Grad Fahrenheit) gestiegen sind. Oberflächennahe Veränderungen waren sogar noch größer. An einem nördlichen Standort seien die Permafrosttemperaturen in seichten Tiefen von minus 8 Grad Celsius auf minus 3 Grad gestiegen. „Minus 3 ist nicht so weit von Null entfernt“, sagte Dr. Romanovsky. Wenn Emissionen und Erwärmung im gleichen Tempo anhalten, würden die Temperaturen nahe der Erdoberfläche um die Mitte des Jahrhunderts über den Gefrierpunkt steigen. Unter Wissenschaftlern wird viel darüber diskutiert, wann und wie viel von Alaskas Permafrost auftauen wird. Und es besteht kein Zweifel, dass das Auftauen des Permafrostbodens Jahrtausende dauern würde. Aber Dr. Romanovsky sagte, dass seine und die Arbeit anderer zeigen, dass Permafrost „nicht so stabil ist, wie die Leute dachten“. Zusätzlich zu den Treibhausgasemissionen verursacht das Auftauen verheerende Schäden an der Infrastruktur und verursacht ein Einbrechen des Landes, wenn Eis an Volumen verliert, wenn es sich in Wasser verwandelt. Die Hauptstraße in Bethel, wo die Durchschnittstemperaturen seit Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts um etwa 4 Grad Fahrenheit gestiegen sind, ist aufgrund von Bodenverschiebungen eher ein Waschbrett als eine Durchgangsstraße. Gebäudefundamente im Bethel bewegen sich und brechen ebenfalls. Einige Straßen, Start- und Landebahnen von Flughäfen und Parkplätze müssen mit flüssigkeitsgefüllten Rohren verstärkt werden, die Wärme aus dem Permafrost transportieren, damit der Boden nicht absackt. Das Auftauen des Permafrostbodens ist ein allmählicher Prozess. Der Boden ist im Winter vollständig gefroren und beginnt von oben nach unten aufzutauen, wenn die Lufttemperaturen im Frühling steigen. Wenn die Durchschnittstemperaturen im Laufe der Jahre steigen, kann diese aufgetaute oder aktive Schicht an Tiefe zunehmen. An der Feldstation interessieren sich die Forscher vor allem dafür, wie sich Waldbrände auf den Permafrost auswirken. Da durch das Verbrennen ein Teil der Vegetation entfernt wird, die als Isolierung dient, geht die Theorie davon aus, dass das Verbrennen dazu führen sollte, dass der Permafrost stärker auftaut. Auf dem Feld extrahieren Sarah Ludwig, eine wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin von Woods Hole (links), und eine Studentin, Laura Jardine, einen Kern aus Permafrost. Im Labor schneidet Ms. Jardine den Kern mit einer Säge. Stash Wislocki, mit Ausnahme des letzten Fotos, von John Schade Auf dem Feld extrahieren Sarah Ludwig, eine Forschungsassistentin von Woods Hole (links), und eine Studentin, Laura Jardine, einen Permafrostkern. Im Labor schneidet Ms. Jardine den Kern mit einer Säge. Stash Wislocki, mit Ausnahme des letzten Fotos, von John Schade Teile der Tundra hier brannten in den 1970er Jahren und im Sommer 2015, daher nahmen die Forscher Kerne sowohl aus verbrannten als auch aus unverbrannten Gebieten. Wissenschaftler kämpften mit dem sperrigen Power-Bohrer, als sich sein Edelstahlrohr seinen Weg in den harten Permafrost bahnte. Kerne – die oft dünne Schichten aus festem Eis enthielten – wurden etikettiert, in einen Kühler verpackt und per Hubschrauber zu einem Gefrierschrank in Bethel geschickt. Auftauender Permafrost unter oder am Rand eines Sees kann dazu führen, dass er wie eine undichte Badewanne ausläuft. Das Auftauen an anderer Stelle kann zu kleinen Höhenänderungen führen, die wiederum zu Änderungen des Wasserflusses durch die Landschaft führen, einige Teile der Tundra austrocknen und andere in Moore verwandeln können. Abgesehen von den lokalen Auswirkungen auf das Pflanzen- und Tierleben können die Landschaftsveränderungen einen wichtigen Einfluss auf den Klimawandel haben, indem sie die Mischung aus Kohlendioxid und Methan, die emittiert wird, verändern. Obwohl Methan nicht so lange in der Atmosphäre verbleibt wie Kohlendioxid, hat es ein weitaus größeres Wärmespeichervermögen und kann zu einer schnelleren Erwärmung beitragen. Deshalb widmen die Forscher viel Zeit der Untersuchung des Wasserflusses und des darin enthaltenen Kohlenstoffs und der Nährstoffe. „Es ist eine der großen Fragen, die es zu lösen gilt – was ist jetzt nass und trocken und was wird in Zukunft nass und trocken sein“, sagte Dr. Natali. Wenn der sich zersetzende Permafrost nass ist, steht den Mikroben weniger Sauerstoff zur Verfügung, sodass sie mehr Methan produzieren. Wenn der Permafrost trocken ist, führt die Zersetzung zu mehr Kohlendioxid. Die Schätzungen darüber, wie viel Kohlenstoff derzeit weltweit durch das Auftauen von Permafrost freigesetzt wird, variieren, aber einer Berechnung zufolge könnten die Emissionen für den Rest des Jahrhunderts im Durchschnitt etwa 1,5 Milliarden Tonnen pro Jahr betragen, oder etwa so viel wie die derzeitigen jährlichen Emissionen aus der Verbrennung fossiler Brennstoffe in den Vereinigten Staaten Zustände. Schon jetzt werden tauender Permafrostboden und wärmere Temperaturen für steigende Kohlenstoffemissionen in der Tundra Alaskas verantwortlich gemacht, sowohl hier als auch weiter nördlich. In einer Studie zu Beginn dieses Jahres fanden Forscher heraus, dass die bakterielle Zersetzung von aufgetautem Permafrost sowie von Kohlendioxid, das von lebender Vegetation produziert wird, später bis in den Herbst hinein fortgesetzt wird, da das Gefrieren der Oberfläche verzögert wird. Der Anstieg der Emissionen war so signifikant, fanden die Forscher, dass Alaska sich möglicherweise von einer Senke oder einem Lagerhaus für Kohlenstoff zu einer Nettoquelle verlagert. Dr. Holmes sagte, diese Verschiebung sei angesichts des Klimatrends nicht überraschend, und er würde erwarten, dass subarktische Teile Sibiriens, Kanadas und andere Gebiete mit Permafrost ähnliche Veränderungen erfahren könnten. „Es gibt eine riesige Menge an Kohlenstoff im Boden, die sich langsam über Tausende und Abertausende von Jahren aufgebaut hat“, sagte er. ""Es war in einem Gefrierschrank, und dieser Gefrierschrank verwandelt sich jetzt in einen Kühlschrank."" Korrektur 23. August 2017 Eine frühere Version dieses Artikels bezog sich fälschlicherweise auf eine Schätzung der Kohlenstoffmenge, die weltweit durch das Auftauen von Permafrost freigesetzt wird. Im Durchschnitt des restlichen Jahrhunderts sind es 1,5 Milliarden Tonnen pro Jahr, derzeit nicht 1,5 Milliarden Tonnen pro Jahr. Korrektur 25.

3edb79e8	Der vergangene Monat war der heißeste Juni, der jemals aufgezeichnet wurde, hat die Satellitenagentur der EU angekündigt. Daten des Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), der vom Europäischen Zentrum für mittelfristige Wettervorhersage im Auftrag der EU implementiert wurde, zeigten, dass die globale Durchschnittstemperatur im Juni 2019 die höchste seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen für den Monat war. Die Daten zeigten, dass die europäischen Durchschnittstemperaturen laut C3S in den letzten Tagen des Monats mehr als 2 ° C über dem Normalwert lagen und die Temperaturen in den meisten Teilen Frankreichs, Deutschlands und Nordspaniens 6-10 ° C über dem Normalwert lagen. Die globale Durchschnittstemperatur war etwa 0,1 °C höher als im zuvor wärmsten Juni 2016. Experten haben gesagt, dass der Klimawandel die rekordverdächtige europäische Hitzewelle der vergangenen Woche laut einer aktuellen Analyse mindestens fünfmal so wahrscheinlich gemacht hat.

Spitzen bei den europäischen Durchschnittstemperaturen von mehr als 1 ° C über dem Normalwert sind bereits zuvor aufgetreten, beispielsweise in den Jahren 1917 und 1999, aber C3S sagte, die jüngste Hitzewelle sei bemerkenswert, da der plötzliche Anstieg zu einem allgemeinen Anstieg der europäischen Temperatur um etwa 1,5 ° C über dem Durchschnitt kam vergangenen 100 Jahren. Als Reaktion auf die rekordverdächtige Hitze sagte Professor Hannah Cloke, Naturgefahrenforscherin an der University of Reading: „Wir wussten, dass der Juni in Europa heiß war, aber diese Studie zeigt, dass Temperaturrekorde nicht nur gebrochen wurden. Sie wurden ausgelöscht. „Dies ist der heißeste Juni seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen in Europa mit einer Landmeile und der wärmste Juni, den wir je weltweit gesehen haben. „Hitzewellen treten in jedem Klima auf, aber wir wissen, dass Hitzewellen aufgrund des Klimawandels viel wahrscheinlicher werden. Das globale Klima wird immer heißer, da sich Treibhausgase weiter ansammeln, wie Wissenschaftler es seit Jahrzehnten vorhergesagt haben.“ Sie fügte jedoch hinzu: „Rasche Versuche, Verbindungen zwischen dem Klimawandel und einzelnen extremen Wetterereignissen zu finden, sind möglich, aber oft mit vielen Vorbehalten verbunden. Wir sollten darauf achten, diese Vorbehalte nicht zu ignorieren, wenn wir uns die Schlussfolgerungen von Attributionsstudien mit schnellem Turnaround ansehen.“ *Eine frühere Schlagzeile zu dieser Geschichte deutete darauf hin, dass der Juni der heißeste Monat war, der je aufgezeichnet wurde.

feaf1f09	Teilen Sie diese Geschichte: Ross McKitrick: All diese Vorhersagen zur Klimaerwärmung haben plötzlich ein großes, neues Problem Ross McKitrick: All diese Vorhersagen zur Klimaerwärmung haben plötzlich ein großes, neues Problem wird nicht so heiß, wie manche denken Foto von Getty Images Inhalt des Artikels Eine der wichtigsten Zahlen der Welt trägt den einprägsamen Titel Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity, kurz ECS. Sie ist ein Maß dafür, wie stark das Klima auf Treibhausgase reagiert. Formeller wird es definiert als der Anstieg der Durchschnittstemperaturen in Grad Celsius auf der ganzen Welt, nachdem die Menge an Kohlendioxid in der Atmosphäre verdoppelt wurde und der Atmosphäre und den Ozeanen ermöglicht wurde, sich vollständig an die Veränderung anzupassen. Der Grund dafür ist, dass es die ultimative Rechtfertigung für die Regierungspolitik zur Bekämpfung des Klimawandels ist. Der Zwischenstaatliche Ausschuss der Vereinten Nationen für Klimaänderungen (IPCC) sagt, dass ECS wahrscheinlich zwischen 1,5 und 4,5 Grad Celsius liegt, aber es kann nicht genauer sein. Was schade ist, denn ein enormer Teil der öffentlichen Politik hängt von ihrem Wert ab. Menschen, die die Auswirkungen der globalen Erwärmung untersuchen, haben festgestellt, dass die Auswirkungen der globalen Erwärmung auf die Wirtschaft bei einem niedrigen ECS – sagen wir weniger als zwei – meist gering und an vielen Stellen leicht vorteilhaft sind. Wenn es sehr niedrig ist, zum Beispiel um eins, bedeutet dies, dass es sich einfach nicht lohnt, etwas gegen die Treibhausgasemissionen zu unternehmen. Aber wenn ECS hoch ist – sagen wir um vier Grad oder mehr – dann ist der Klimawandel wahrscheinlich ein großes Problem. Wir können es vielleicht nicht aufhalten, aber wir sollten uns besser darauf vorbereiten, uns darauf einzustellen. Wir entschuldigen uns, aber dieses Video konnte nicht geladen werden.

Inhalt des Artikels Irgendjemand sollte also irgendwo ECS messen. Wie sich herausstellt, haben viele Leute es versucht, und was sie herausgefunden haben, hat enorme politische Auswirkungen. Um zu verstehen, warum, müssen wir uns zunächst ein wenig mit der Methodik befassen. Es gibt zwei Möglichkeiten, wie Wissenschaftler versuchen, ECS zu schätzen. Die erste besteht darin, ein Klimamodell zu verwenden, die modellierte CO2-Konzentration gegenüber dem vorindustriellen Niveau zu verdoppeln und es laufen zu lassen, bis sich die Temperaturen einige hundert Jahre in der Zukunft stabilisieren. Dieser Ansatz, der als modellbasierte Methode bezeichnet wird, hängt in seiner Genauigkeit von der Gültigkeit des Klimamodells ab, und da sich die Modelle ziemlich voneinander unterscheiden, liefert er eine breite Palette möglicher Antworten. Eine bekannte statistische Verteilung, die aus Modellierungsstudien abgeleitet wurde, fasst die Unsicherheiten dieser Methode zusammen. Es zeigt, dass ECS wahrscheinlich zwischen zwei und 4,5 Grad liegt, möglicherweise so niedrig wie 1,5, aber nicht niedriger, und möglicherweise so hoch wie neun Grad. Dieser Bereich der potenziellen Erwärmung hat großen Einfluss auf ökonomische Analysen der Kosten des Klimawandels. Die zweite Methode besteht darin, langfristige historische Daten zu Temperaturen, Sonnenaktivität, Kohlendioxidemissionen und atmosphärischer Chemie zu verwenden, um ECS unter Verwendung eines einfachen statistischen Modells zu schätzen, das durch Anwendung des Energieerhaltungsgesetzes auf die Planetenatmosphäre abgeleitet wird. Dies wird als Energiebilanzmethode bezeichnet. Es stützt sich auf eine gewisse Extrapolation, um die Definition von ECS zu erfüllen, hat aber den Vorteil, dass die verfügbaren Daten berücksichtigt werden, die zeigen, wie sich die tatsächliche Atmosphäre in den letzten 150 Jahren verhalten hat. Die Werbegeschichte wird unten fortgesetzt. Diese Anzeige wurde noch nicht geladen, aber Ihr Artikel wird unten fortgesetzt. Artikelinhalt Überraschend ist, dass die Schätzungen der Energiebilanz im Vergleich zu modellbasierten Schätzungen sehr niedrig sind. Das beigefügte Diagramm vergleicht den modellbasierten Bereich mit ECS-Schätzungen aus einem Dutzend Energiebilanzstudien der letzten zehn Jahre. Offensichtlich geben diese beiden Methoden unterschiedliche Antworten, und die Frage, welche genauer ist, ist wichtig. Klimamodellierer haben zwei Erklärungen für die Diskrepanz vorgeschlagen. Einer wird als „Emergent Constraint“-Ansatz bezeichnet. Die Idee ist, dass Modelle eine Reihe von ECS-Werten liefern, und obwohl wir ECS nicht direkt messen können, liefern die Modelle auch Schätzungen für viele andere Dinge, die wir messen können (z. B. das Reflexionsvermögen von Wolkenoberseiten), so dass wir es könnten Vergleichen Sie diese anderen Maße mit den Daten, und wenn wir das tun, liefern die Modelle mit hohen ECS-Werten manchmal auch Maße für sekundäre Dinge, die besser zu den Daten passen als Modelle mit niedrigen ECS-Werten. Dieses Argument war ein bisschen schwer zu verkaufen, da die beteiligten Korrelationen oft schwach sind, und es erklärt nicht, warum die Ergebnisse der Energiebilanz so niedrig sind. Der zweite Ansatz basiert auf sogenannten „Forcing Efficiencys“, also dem Konzept, dass Klimaantriebe wie Treibhausgase und Aerosolschadstoffe sich in ihrer zeitlichen und räumlichen Wirksamkeit unterscheiden, und wenn diese Schwankungen berücksichtigt werden, die Energiebilanz Sensitivitätsschätzungen können höher ausfallen. Auch dies war ein umstrittener Vorschlag. Eine aktuelle Energiebilanz-ECS-Schätzung wurde gerade im Journal of Climate von Nicholas Lewis und Judith Curry veröffentlicht. Es gibt mehrere Merkmale, die ihr Studium besonders wertvoll machen. Erstens verlassen sie sich auf IPCC-Schätzungen von Treibhausgasen, Sonnenveränderungen und anderen Klimaantrieben, sodass ihnen nicht vorgeworfen werden kann, durch ihre Wahl der Daten einen Finger auf die Waage zu legen. Zweitens berücksichtigen sie die Wirksamkeitsfrage und diskutieren sie ausführlich. Sie berücksichtigen auch die jüngsten Debatten darüber, wie Oberflächentemperaturen gemessen oder nicht gemessen werden sollten und wie mit Gebieten wie der Arktis umzugehen ist, in denen nur wenige Daten vorliegen. Drittens berechnen sie ihre Schätzungen über eine Vielzahl von Start- und Enddaten, um zu überprüfen, ob ihre ECS-Schätzung nicht von der relativen Erwärmungslücke der letzten zwei Jahrzehnte abhängt. Die Werbegeschichte wird unten fortgesetzt. Diese Anzeige wurde noch nicht geladen, aber Ihr Artikel wird unten fortgesetzt. Artikelinhalt Es sieht so aus, als müssten die Klimamodelle, die wir seit Jahrzehnten verwenden, überarbeitet werden. Ihre ECS-Schätzung liegt bei 1,5 Grad, mit einem Wahrscheinlichkeitsbereich zwischen 1,05 und 2,45 Grad. Wenn es sich bei der Studie um einen einmaligen Ausreißer handelt, können wir ihn möglicherweise ignorieren. Aber es ist Teil einer langen Liste von Studien unabhängiger Teams (wie diese interaktive Grafik zeigt), die mit einer Vielzahl von Methoden, die kritische Herausforderungen berücksichtigen, alle zu dem Schluss kommen, dass Klimamodelle eine zu große Empfindlichkeit gegenüber Treibhausgasen aufweisen. Die politischen Entscheidungsträger müssen aufmerksam sein, denn diese Debatte wirkt sich direkt auf die Diskussion über die CO2-Steuer aus. Die Environmental Protection Agency verwendet soziale Kosten von CO2-Modellen, die sich auf die modellbasierten ECS-Schätzungen stützen. Letztes Jahr haben zwei Kollegen und ich eine Studie veröffentlicht, in der wir eine frühere ECS-Schätzung von Lewis und Curry genommen und in zwei dieser Modelle gesteckt haben. Das Ergebnis war, dass die geschätzten volkswirtschaftlichen Schäden durch Treibhausgasemissionen um 40 bis 80 Prozent zurückgingen und bei einem Modell die Schäden mit einer 40-prozentigen Wahrscheinlichkeit für die nächsten Jahrzehnte negativ waren – das heißt, sie würden es tun vorteilhafte Veränderungen sein. Die neue ECS-Schätzung von Lewis und Curry ist sogar noch niedriger als ihre alte. Wenn wir also dieselbe Studie erneut durchführen würden, würden wir sogar noch niedrigere soziale Kosten von Kohlenstoff finden. Wenn ECS so niedrig ist, wie es die Energiebilanzliteratur vermuten lässt, bedeutet dies, dass die Klimamodelle, die wir seit Jahrzehnten verwenden, zu heiß werden und überarbeitet werden müssen. Es bedeutet auch, dass Treibhausgasemissionen nicht so große Auswirkungen auf das Klima haben, wie behauptet wurde, und die Argumente für kostspielige politische Maßnahmen zur Reduzierung von Kohlendioxidemissionen sind viel schwächer, als uns die Regierungen gesagt haben. Für eine Wissenschaft, die angeblich Anfang der 1990er Jahre „sesshaft“ wurde, müssen wir sicherlich noch viel lernen.

4852bd38	"Nachdem der Zyklon Pam der Kategorie 5 sein Land auseinandergerissen und einen humanitären Notfall ausgelöst hatte, machte Vanuatus Präsident Baldwin Lonsdale zumindest einen Teil der Schuld für die missliche Lage der Inseln auf die vom Menschen verursachte globale Erwärmung. Der Sturm, der mit einer Heftigkeit zuschlug, die das Land noch nie zuvor in der modernen Geschichte erlebt hatte, hatte Windgeschwindigkeiten von 165 Meilen pro Stunde, mit Böen von über 200 Meilen pro Stunde, als er durch das winzige Land brüllte. Auf der bevölkerungsreichsten Insel Efate, einschließlich der Hauptstadt Port Vila, wurden Häuser und Geschäfte dem Erdboden gleichgemacht und Bäume kahl geschlagen. Die Zahl der Todesopfer lag am Dienstag bei 24, wird aber voraussichtlich steigen, wenn mehr Informationen von abgelegenen Inseln einströmen, die von der Außenwelt abgeschnitten sind. „Dies ist ein sehr verheerender Zyklon … ich nenne es ein Monster, das Vanuatu getroffen hat“, sagte Lonsdale laut The Guardian auf einem UN-Katastrophengipfel in Japan. „Das ist ein Rückschlag für die Regierung und die Menschen in Vanuatu. … Die gesamte Entwicklung, die stattgefunden hat, wurde ausgelöscht.“ Er sagte, die Zyklonsaisonen, die die Nation erlebt habe, seien das Ergebnis des Klimawandels. „Wir sehen den Anstieg des Meeresspiegels … die Zyklonjahreszeiten, die Hitze, der Regen, all dies wird beeinflusst“, sagte er. Hat der Präsident also recht, wenn er den verheerenden Zyklon mit der globalen Erwärmung in Verbindung bringt? Oder ist die Krawatte so schwach, dass sie fast nicht vorhanden ist? Die Antwort ist, wie so oft in der Klimawissenschaft, weitaus nuancierter, als Vanuatus Präsident es darstellt. Wissenschaftler sagen, dass ungewöhnlich milde Meeresoberflächentemperaturen und zusätzlicher atmosphärischer Wasserdampf dazu beigetragen haben, dass sich der Sturm verstärkte, bevor er in Vanuatu einschlug. Gleichzeitig machte der steigende Meeresspiegel den Sturm wahrscheinlich schädlicher als noch vor wenigen Jahrzehnten. Hier sind die wichtigsten Faktoren, die bei der Analyse der potenziellen Verbindungen zwischen dem Zyklon Pam und dem sich erwärmenden Klima zu berücksichtigen sind. Ozeantemperaturen sind der Hauptverdächtige Wissenschaftler, mit denen Mashable Kontakt aufnahm, sagten, der Sturm habe sich schnell verstärkt, bevor er Vanuatu traf, unterstützt durch ein Gebiet mit ungewöhnlich mildem Ozeanwasser und günstigen atmosphärischen Bedingungen. Die Meerestemperaturen in dem Bereich, in dem sich der Zyklon verstärkte, lagen bis zu 2 Grad Celsius über dem Durchschnitt für diese Jahreszeit (3,6 Grad Fahrenheit). Laut Kevin Trenberth, einem Klimaforscher am National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, und anderen Experten, hängen einige – aber nicht alle – Anomalien der Meeresoberflächentemperatur im Südwestpazifik wahrscheinlich mit der globalen Erwärmung zusammen. Globale Meeresoberflächentemperaturen, die ein Gebiet mit extrem warmem Wasser in der Nähe von Vanuatu und Australien zeigen. Bild: NOAA/ESRL Laut Trenberth können etwa 0,6 Grad Celsius oder 1,1 Grad Fahrenheit der Meerestemperaturanomalien „auf die vom Menschen verursachte globale Erwärmung zurückgeführt werden“, während der Rest „natürlich“ ist und mit einem anhaltenden El Niño in Verbindung gebracht wird Ereignis im tropischen Pazifik. El Niño ist ein Klimaphänomen, das in weiten Teilen des tropischen Pazifiks überdurchschnittlich hohe Meerestemperaturen aufweist. Es kann weltweite Wettermuster verändern, einschließlich tropischer Wirbelstürme im Pazifik und Atlantik. Was auch immer die Ursache sein mag, das warme Ozeanwasser kann Stürme wie den Zyklon Pam verstärken, da mehr Verdunstung stattfindet und der Luft Feuchtigkeit zugeführt wird. „Die Atmosphäre dort hat rund 10 bis 20 % mehr Feuchtigkeit als ein vergleichbarer Sturm in den 1970er Jahren gehabt hätte. Die hohen Meeresoberflächentemperaturen und der Wasserdampf haben den Sturm angeheizt und zweifellos seine Intensität und Größe erhöht“, sagte Trenberth in einem E-Mail-Gespräch. ""Die Winde sind stärker, die Sturmflut auf höheren Meeresspiegeln größer."" El Niño „hat hier zusätzlich zur globalen Erwärmung eine Rolle gespielt. Aber starke Stürme können in dieser Region durchaus auftreten (aber nicht so stark). Die Meeresoberflächentemperaturen liegen um Himmels willen bei über 30 Grad Fahrenheit“, sagte er. Eine Analyse der langfristigen Trends der Meeresoberflächentemperaturen in der Region, in der sich der Zyklon Pam schnell zu einem Monster der Kategorie 5 intensivierte, zeigt, dass es seit 1948 einen Erwärmungstrend gibt, obwohl diese Daten erhebliche Unsicherheiten aufweisen, sagt Michael Ventrice, ein Operateur Meteorologe bei der WSI Corporation in Massachusetts. Er sagte, es sei aus den Daten nicht klar, ob die höheren Temperaturen das Ergebnis natürlicher Schwankungen oder menschlicher Einflüsse seien. Abweichungen der Meeresoberflächentemperatur vom Durchschnitt in der Nähe von Vanuatu und Australien (Stand: 16. März 2015). Bild: WeatherbellAnalytics „Unter dem Strich wurde an der Stelle, an der sich Pam verstärkte, ein langfristiger Erwärmungstrend beobachtet“, sagte Ventrice . Madden und Julian... Ventrice sagt, dass Zyklon Pam in einer Umgebung „gedieh“, die für eine explosive Intensivierung gut geeignet war. Zu diesen Umweltfaktoren gehörten das warme Ozeanwasser, das sich tief in den Ozean erstreckte, sowie ein natürlicher Wetterzyklus, der als Madden Julian Oscillation oder MJO bekannt ist. In bestimmten Fällen kann das MJO die Luft zum Aufsteigen anregen und Gewitter sowie tropische Wirbelstürme bilden. Stellen Sie sich das MJO als eine helfende Hand vor, die wahrscheinlich zur schnellen Intensivierung des Sturms beigetragen hat. „Das MJO dient dazu, die mittleren und oberen Schichten der Atmosphäre zu befeuchten und die vertikale Windscherung zu reduzieren, beides Parameter, die für eine Intensivierung unerlässlich sind“, sagte Ventrice. Wenige robuste Trends bei tropischen Wirbelstürmen in der Nähe von Vanuatu Klimaforschung hat gezeigt, dass tropische Wirbelstürme in vielen Ozeanbecken stärker werden und länger anhalten als früher. Der Südwestpazifik, in dem Zyklon Pam aufgetreten ist, gehört jedoch nicht zu diesen Gebieten, möglicherweise aufgrund des relativen Mangels an Daten dort. Kerry Emanuel, ein Meteorologe am MIT, der ein bekannter Forscher ist, der Trends im Zusammenhang mit der globalen Erwärmung bei tropischen Stürmen und Hurrikanen untersucht, sagte gegenüber Mashable, dass nicht viel über Trends in der Umgebung von Vanuatu gesagt werden kann. „Ironischerweise ist dies ein Teil der Welt, in dem wir keine signifikanten Aufwärtstrends bei den Metriken tropischer Wirbelstürme beobachten, und nur wenige Modelle sagen dort Aufwärtstrends als Folge der globalen Erwärmung voraus“, sagte er in einer E-Mail. In einem Beitrag für den Blog Realclimate vom 18. März schrieb Emanuel, dass es Anzeichen dafür gibt, dass sich einige Parameter schwerer tropischer Wirbelstürme ändern, selbst in Gebieten wie dem südwestpazifischen Becken, wo nur wenige Daten vorliegen. „Während Pam und Haiyan sowie andere tropische Wirbelsturmkatastrophen der jüngsten Vergangenheit nicht eindeutig auf die globale Erwärmung zurückzuführen sind, wurden sie zweifellos durch den natürlichen und anthropogenen Klimawandel beeinflusst und erinnern uns an unsere anhaltende Anfälligkeit für solche Stürme“, Emanuel genannt. Tom Knutson, ein Forscher der National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, sagt, dass das südwestpazifische Becken von den sechs Ozeanbecken, die tropische Wirbelstürme hervorrufen, ein Gebiet ist, das bis zum Ende des Jahres die geringste Tendenz zu einer Zunahme der Sturmaktivität zeigt Jahrhundert. Tatsächlich könnte es dort eine Abnahme der Zyklonfrequenz oder -intensität geben, basierend auf den neuesten Computermodellsimulationen, sagt Knutson. James Elsner, Professor an der Florida State University, der untersucht hat, wie die globale Erwärmung die stärksten Stürme der Erde verändern könnte, sagt, er wäre überrascht, wenn die Stürme im Südpazifik nicht stärker werden würden, wie die Stürme anderswo. Aber die Daten sind noch nicht da, um es zu beweisen. „Wir haben eine ziemlich solide Grundlage (physikalisch und empirisch) für unser Verständnis, dass Ozeanhitze die stärksten tropischen Wirbelstürme stärker macht“, sagte er. „Empirisch wurde es für die Welt als Ganzes und für den Nordatlantik gezeigt. Aber das Signal ist in verrauschten Daten schwer zu erkennen, und besonders dort, wo es durch einen Trend zu weniger Wirbelstürmen verwirrt wird.“ Obwohl möglicherweise noch keine Signale für die globale Erwärmung vorhanden sind, haben mehrere Studien gezeigt, dass die vom Menschen verursachte globale Erwärmung wahrscheinlich dazu führen wird, dass tropische Wirbelstürme (einschließlich Hurrikane und Taifune) im Durchschnitt intensiver sind als heute, was bedeutet, dass diese Stürme stärker sein werden destruktiv. Die vom Menschen verursachte Erwärmung wird laut Peer-Review-Forschung in einigen Ozeanbecken in den nächsten Jahrzehnten wahrscheinlich auch zu einem Anstieg der Zahl extrem intensiver tropischer Wirbelstürme führen. Da der Anstieg des Meeresspiegels Zyklone bereits zerstörerischer macht, indem er ihnen eine höhere Startrampe für Sturmfluten verschafft, bedeutet dies, dass zukünftige Stürme um eine Größenordnung schädlicher sein können als das, was wir normalerweise heute erleben. Als kleiner, niedrig gelegener Inselstaat ist sich Vanuatu des Anstiegs des Meeresspiegels aufgrund der globalen Erwärmung sehr bewusst. Zusammen mit anderen kleinen Inselstaaten, von denen einige von demselben Zyklon betroffen waren, hat sich Vanuatu bei den Vereinten Nationen für drastische Senkungen der Treibhausgasemissionen eingesetzt, um die Schwere des Klimawandels zu verringern, und sieht darin eine Frage seines Überlebens als Nation ."

ebd188a7	"Der Hurrikan Patricia, der die Küste Westmexikos mit katastrophalen Auswirkungen bedroht, verstärkte sich mit einer Geschwindigkeit, die zu den schnellsten gehörte, die Wissenschaftler irgendwo auf der Erde beobachtet haben. Der Sturm stieg in nur 30 Stunden von Windgeschwindigkeiten von 60 Meilen pro Stunde auf 200 Meilen pro Stunde. Am frühen Freitagmorgen war der Sturm der heftigste Hurrikan, der jemals im Ostpazifik oder im gesamten Nordatlantikbecken, zu dem auch der Golf von Mexiko und die Karibik gehören, verzeichnet wurde. Es ist kein Zufall, dass dieser Sturm in einem Gebiet mit fast rekordverdächtig warmen Meeresoberflächentemperaturen explodierte, das noch nicht von anderen Stürmen der letzten Zeit erschlossen worden war. Es ist auch ein Gebiet, in dem die atmosphärischen Bedingungen für die Stärke eines solchen Sturms günstig waren. Bedenken Sie Folgendes: Am Donnerstag um 5 Uhr morgens ET hatte der Sturm Winde mit 85 Meilen pro Stunde und einen minimalen zentralen Luftdruck von 980 Millibar. Am Freitag um 5 Uhr ET nahmen die Winde auf 200 Meilen pro Stunde zu, mit einem Luftdruck von 880 Millibar. Das ist ein erstaunlicher Luftdruckabfall von 100 Millibar innerhalb von 24 Stunden, was praktisch unerhört ist. Die Intensivierungsrate sah aus wie eine steile Treppe, wenn sie mithilfe eines satellitengestützten Computeralgorithmus, der die Sturmintensität verfolgt, grafisch dargestellt wurde. Das Diagramm zeigt die schnelle Intensivierungsrate des Hurrikans Patricia. Bild: University of Wisconsin Eine Periode rascher Intensivierung wurde von den meisten Hurrikan-Vorhersagemodellen vorhergesagt, obwohl keines die schiere Wildheit voraussah, die der Sturm schließlich erreichen würde. Während Wissenschaftler in den letzten Jahren große Fortschritte gemacht haben, um zu verstehen, welche Faktoren dazu führen, dass Hurrikane und Taifune sich schnell verstärken, gibt es noch einige Rätsel über diesen Prozess. Basierend auf E-Mail-Gesprächen, die Mashable am Freitagmorgen mit einem halben Dutzend Experten für tropische Wirbelstürme führte, wissen wir Folgendes. Warmes Wasser diente als Treibstoff Der Sturm explodierte über einem Gebiet mit außergewöhnlich warmem Ozean, mit Wassertemperaturen von 1 bis 2 Grad Celsius über dem Durchschnitt für diese Jahreszeit. Darüber hinaus waren die atmosphärischen Bedingungen in diesem Gebiet ideal für einen schnell stärker werdenden Sturm geeignet, wobei die so genannte ""thermodynamische Potenzialintensität"" maximal angezeigt wurde. Dies geschah genau in dem Bereich, in dem Patricia am Freitagmorgen ihren Weg in die Rekordbücher fand. Die Ozeanwärme ist größtenteils auf ein rekordverdächtig starkes El Niño-Ereignis zurückzuführen, das nicht nur die Meerestemperaturen im östlichen tropischen Pazifik erhöht hat, sondern auch dazu geführt hat, dass sich dieses warme Wasser tiefer als gewöhnlich unter der Oberfläche ausdehnt, was auch der Fall ist hilft Stürme zu intensivieren. Anomalie der Meeresoberflächentemperatur in dem Gebiet, in dem sich der Hurrikan Patricia intensivierte. Bild: WeatherBell Analytics Darüber hinaus haben sich die meisten Stürme, die sich in diesem Jahr bisher gebildet haben – und es gab eine Rekordzahl im östlichen tropischen Pazifik – weit westlich der Stelle gebildet, an der Patricia auftauchte. Diese ließen viel ungestörtes warmes Wasser zurück, das für einen Sturm wie diesen Treibstoff ist. „Grundsätzlich hat das näher an Mexiko gelegene Gebiet normalerweise viel mehr tropische Wirbelstürme in der Nähe“, sagte Eric Blake, Hurrikanspezialist am National Hurricane Center in Miami. „Da sie alle viel weiter westlich waren, bewegte sich Patricia schließlich über sehr warme, unerschlossene Gewässer, wobei der Rest der Bedingungen ziemlich reif war.“ Kooperative Atmosphäre Ryan Maue, ein Meteorologe der privaten Wetterfirma WeatherBell Analytics, sagte, dass am Donnerstag „Alarmglocken“ läuteten, basierend auf Computermodellangaben, dass der Sturm sich schnell verstärken würde.

Oktober 2015 Diese Signale zeigten eine „optimale/perfekte Atmosphäre und Meeresbedingungen für eine explosive Intensivierung“ Maure hat geschrieben. Er sagte, die Tatsache, dass Patricia ein kleiner Sturm mit einem kompakten inneren Kern aus intensiven Gewittern ist, half ihm, „den Druck innerhalb eines winzigen Radius des maximalen Windes zu vertiefen“. (Der Sturm ist flächenmäßig kleiner als der Super-Taifun Haiyan und der Hurrikan Katrina.) Maue bemerkte auch, dass die Meerestemperaturen, die der Sturm anzapft, zu diesem Zeitpunkt mit etwa 31 Grad Celsius die wärmsten auf der gesamten nördlichen Hemisphäre sind 88 Grad Fahrenheit. Aber ist diese Intensitätsrate ein Hinweis darauf, wie die globale Erwärmung die Eigenschaften und das Verhalten der stärksten Stürme der Natur verändert? Diese Frage ist derzeit schwieriger zu beantworten, sagten Wissenschaftler gegenüber Mashable. Potenzielle Intensität tropischer Wirbelstürme (Stand: 19. Oktober 2015) mit dem höchsten Wert in der Nähe der Stelle, an der sich Hurrikan Patricia intensivierte. Bild: Kerry Emanuel Kerry Emanuel, ein Hurrikan-Experte am MIT, sagte, das Fehlen einer konsistenten Aufzeichnung von Stürmen im Ostpazifik mit Hurrikan-Jägerflügen mache es schwierig festzustellen, ob es bei solchen Stürmen einen mit der globalen Erwärmung zusammenhängenden Trend gibt. Solche Flüge werden typischerweise im Atlantik und nur gelegentlich im Ostpazifik geflogen, daher war dies ein Ausnahmefall. „Es steht außer Frage, dass dies ein außergewöhnlich intensiver tropischer Wirbelsturm ist“, schrieb er. „Aber ich frage mich, ob wir wirklich wissen, dass frühere Stürme in der Region nicht so intensiv waren, und wir haben einfach Glück, diesen gemessen zu haben.“ Überlegungen zur globalen Erwärmung Maue seinerseits sagte, dass Hurrikane dazu neigen, eher auf lokale Bedingungen zu reagieren, wenn sie sich verstärken oder abschwächen, als auf globale Trends. „Hurrikane reagieren lokal, und schnelle/explosive Intensivierungsänderungen aufgrund des Klimawandels könnten die Folge sein, aber mit nur einem Sturm während eines starken El Niño schwer zu sagen“, schrieb er. Kevin Trenberth, ein leitender Klimaforscher am National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, sagte, die ungewöhnlich milden Meerestemperaturen lassen mehr Feuchtigkeit in den Sturm fließen, was das Feuer anheizt. Die Forschung von Trenberth hat gezeigt, dass die globale Erwärmung den verfügbaren Wasserdampf für Stürme auf der ganzen Welt erhöht hat, was bei allem, von intensiveren lokalen Regengüssen bis hin zu Hurrikanen, eine Rolle spielt. „Die Feuchtigkeit, die in den Sturm fließt, der seinen Hauptbrennstoff liefert, muss höher sein als je zuvor“, schrieb er. „Es erfordert immer noch das richtige Setup, um das in einen intensiven Sturm umzuwandeln, aber die Umwelt ist sicherlich reif. Das besteht natürlich aus einer erheblichen El Niño-bezogenen Komponente, aber auch aus der globalen Erwärmung im Hintergrund, die durch den Ozean eine Erinnerung hat Wärmeinhalt."" Laut Trenberth hat El Niño die Meereswärme über den tropischen Pazifik umverteilt und ein Bullseye der Hitze direkt unter den Hurrikan Patricia gelegt. ""Dies ist der wärmste großräumige Punkt der Hemisphäre"", sagte Trenberth. Dies führt dazu, dass Feuchtigkeit aus dem relativ kühleren Ozeanwasser um ihn herum in diesen Bereich strömt. Der Meeresspiegel vor der Küste Mexikos liegt aufgrund des warmen Wasservorsprungs etwa 8 Zoll über dem Durchschnitt (Wasser dehnt sich aus, wenn es erhitzt wird). ""Der unterirdische Ozean ist außergewöhnlich warm, ebenso wie die Meeresoberfläche"", sagte er. Es ist nicht nur El Niño, der die Meerestemperaturen im östlichen Pazifik in die Höhe treibt. Laut dem Hurrikanforscher Gabriel Vecchi vom Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey, tragen auch andere natürliche Klimazyklen dazu bei. „Um zu beantworten, welche Faktoren dominant waren und um wie viel, wäre eine systematische Analyse erforderlich – also glaube ich nicht, dass ich bereit bin, auf die Hüfte zu schießen, um Ihnen zu sagen, welche in diesem Jahr wichtig sind, geschweige denn für diesen speziellen Sturm ,"" er sagte. „Aber ich bin der Meinung, dass es Zeit und Möglichkeiten geben wird, die Auswirkungen dieser Faktoren in Zukunft zu bewerten.“ Laut Vecchi zeigen Prognosen, dass die globale Erwärmung die Meerestemperaturen im östlichen tropischen Pazifik erhöhen wird, was zu mehr Hurrikanen wie diesem führen könnte. Tom Knutson, der in Princeton mit Vecchi zusammenarbeitet, sagte gegenüber Mashable, dass eine neue Studie zeigt, dass das nordöstliche pazifische Becken, in dem sich der Hurrikan Patricia befindet, die größte zukünftige Zunahme der Häufigkeit von Stürmen der Kategorien 4 und 5 auf der ganzen Erde haben wird er sagt, ist ""wahrscheinlich nur ein Zufall"". Er sagte, Computermodellierungsstudien, die er und seine Kollegen veröffentlicht haben, zeigen, dass die menschengemachte Erwärmung die Sturmintensität in Zukunft erhöhen wird und dass dieser Trend im Nordostpazifik bereits in einem „kleinen“ Ausmaß begonnen haben könnte. Knutson warnte davor, dass Beobachtungen von Stürmen im Nordostpazifik noch keinen solchen Trend zeigen, zumindest für den Zeitraum von 1982 bis 2009."

56696255	"Es gibt etwas an einem warmen Februartag, das Sie daran erinnert, dass etwas einfach nicht stimmt. Es gibt einem das nagende Gefühl, dass die globale Erwärmung vielleicht doch real ist. Der Februar 2017 war geprägt von anhaltend warmem Wetter, wie es viele Gegenden noch nie zuvor oder nur selten erlebt haben. Insgesamt gesehen hat der bisherige Monat in den USA ein lächerlich einseitiges Verhältnis von täglichen Rekordhöhen zu täglichen Rekordtiefs, was ein Schlüsselindikator für kurzfristige Wetterschwankungen und längerfristig vom Menschen verursacht ist Klimawandel. Einzelne warme Tage verdanken Sie vor allem dem Jetstream. Dieser Strom aus sich schnell bewegender Luft in etwa 35.000 Fuß über dem Boden hat eine endlose Reihe von Stürmen in die Westküste gelenkt, wo die kalifornischen Berge bisher verrückte 500 Zoll Schnee aufgesammelt haben und sich dann über die USA bewegt haben ein Weg, der den Strom kalter Luft aus der Arktis abgeschnitten hat. Während die vorübergehende Wettervariabilität hier eine Schlüsselrolle spielt, ist die weit verbreitete Rekordwärme in den USA in diesem Jahr bisher Teil eines langfristigen Trends zu mehr warmen Temperaturrekorden gegenüber kalten. Ich genieße dieses Wetter, aber zu wissen, dass unsere Erde gefährlich ist. Bis zum 23. Februar haben die täglichen Rekordhochs die täglichen Rekordtiefs um ein Verhältnis von weit mehr als 100 zu 1 weggeblasen, was, wenn es noch ein paar Tage anhält, selbst einen Rekord aufstellen würde. Bisher wurden in diesem Monat fast 5.000 tägliche Rekordhochs gesetzt oder gebunden, verglichen mit nur 42 täglichen Rekordtiefs. (Obwohl dieses Rekordverhältnis in Anbetracht des kurzen Kalendermonats ein Sternchen erfordern könnte.) Und es sind nicht die Tagesrekorde, die am beeindruckendsten sind, sondern eher die Anzahl der Monatsrekorde, die von der Golfküste bis zum Mittlerer Westen und Nordosten nach Kanada. Allein in der vergangenen Woche (ohne den 23. Februar) wurden in den USA 736 tägliche Rekordhochs gesetzt oder erreicht, verglichen mit null täglichen Rekordtiefs im gleichen Zeitraum. Noch verblüffender ist die Anzahl der in den letzten sieben Tagen eingestellten oder gebundenen Rekordtemperaturen über Nacht, die sich auf satte 940 belaufen. Es wurden im gleichen Zeitraum keine Rekordtiefsttemperaturen über Nacht eingestellt oder eingestellt. Und die monatlichen Rekorde, die viel schwerer zu brechen sind als tägliche Meilensteine, sind erstaunlich. Temperaturanomalie in ganz Nordamerika für den 19. Februar, wie durch das GFS-Computermodell gesehen. Bild: Wetterglockenanalytik Laut dem National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) in Asheville, North Carolina, wurden im Februar 336 monatliche Rekordhöhen aufgestellt oder eingestellt, zusammen mit 203 Rekorden, die für die wärmste Mindesttemperatur über Nacht aufgestellt oder eingestellt wurden. Im Vergleich dazu wurde bis zum 23. Februar kein einziger monatlicher Kälterekord aufgestellt oder gebunden. Diese Zahlen beinhalten keine monatlichen Temperaturrekorde, die am Freitag gebrochen wurden, darunter 73 Grad in Boston, was den vorherigen Rekord um 3 Grad Fahrenheit brach. Darüber hinaus erreichte Allentown, Pennsylvania, bemerkenswerte 77 Grad, und Binghamton, New York, erreichte 70 Grad Fahrenheit. Dayton, Cincinatti und Columbus Ohio haben jeweils am Freitag ihre monatlichen Höchsttemperaturrekorde entweder gleichgestellt oder gebrochen, wobei auch am Donnerstag zahlreiche monatliche Meilensteine ​​gesetzt wurden. In Albany, New York, war die Höchsttemperatur von 74 Grad am Donnerstag die wärmste Temperatur, die an einem beliebigen Tag in den Monaten Dezember, Januar und Februar gemessen wurde.

Milwaukee zum Beispiel brach sein monatliches Allzeit-Rekordhoch für Februar, als die Temperatur 21 Grad Fahrenheit erreichte, und Madison stellte mit einem Höchstwert von 68 Grad Fahrenheit einen Monatsrekord auf. Chicago erreichte heute im Februar zum fünften Mal seit 1871 70°. Dies geschah auch am Samstag. Höchste Februartemperatur von 75° (27.2.1976) in Gefahr – NWS Chicago (@NWSChicago) 20. Februar 2017 In Ottumwa, Iowa, wo der Boden zu dieser Jahreszeit normalerweise schneebedeckt wäre, betrug die Höchsttemperatur am Mittwoch 79 Grad, was ebenfalls einen Monatsrekord aufstellte. Einige Städte haben Rekorde für die längste Februarwärme aufgestellt, die sie je gesehen haben, darunter Kansas City, das laut weather.com am Mittwoch einen siebentägigen Wärmerekord im Februar aufstellte. Am Montag hatte Chicago eine Höchsttemperatur von 70 Grad, was erst das fünfte Mal in einem Februar in der „Windy City“ war. (Das vierte Mal kam ebenfalls diesen Februar.) Das warme Wetter im Mittleren Westen wurde durch einen deutlichen Mangel an Schneedecke und Seeeis über den Großen Seen ermöglicht, wodurch die Lufttemperaturen bei milden Südwestwinden tagelang steigen konnten. Am 22. Februar waren nur 19,1 Prozent der unteren 48 Bundesstaaten schneebedeckt, weit unter dem Durchschnitt für diese Jahreszeit. Während kalte Luft im Mittleren Westen ein Comeback feiert, wo voraussichtlich starker Schneefall von Nebraska bis nach Wisconsin fallen wird, wird ein Großteil des Südens und Ostens wahrscheinlich noch mindestens ein paar Tage milder als der Durchschnitt bleiben. Wo ist der Schnee? Bild: noaa Das warme Wetter in den USA ist auch kein ungewöhnliches Phänomen, das erst seit einigen Wochen auftritt. Das seit Jahresbeginn durchschnittliche Verhältnis von Rekord-Tageshöchstständen zu Rekord-Tagestiefstständen von mehr als 4 zu 1, und Studien haben gezeigt, dass in den letzten Jahrzehnten die vom Menschen verursachte globale Erwärmung die Wahrscheinlichkeit warmer Temperaturrekorde erhöht hat so dass diese Verhältnisse immer mehr verzerrt werden. Und die Wärme ist auch nicht nur auf die USA beschränkt, da der Planet seinen drittwärmsten Januar seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen verzeichnet, nach seinem bisher wärmsten Jahr im Jahr 2016. Dies setzt die langfristige Erwärmung von etwa 1,7 Grad Fahrenheit seit zuverlässiger Oberfläche fort Temperaturen begannen im Jahr 1880. Da sich der Planet als Reaktion auf die Anhäufung von Treibhausgasen in der Atmosphäre erwärmt, ist das Verhältnis von Hochtemperaturrekorden zu Niedrigtemperaturrekorden schiefer geworden. Wenn sich das Klima nicht erwärmen würde, sollte dieses langfristige Verhältnis etwa 1:1 betragen. Das ist jedoch nicht die Welt, in der wir leben. Eine Studie aus dem Jahr 2009 ergab, dass das Verhältnis von Rekordhöhen zu -tiefs in den 48 unteren Bundesstaaten in den 2000er Jahren 2:1 betrug, und diese Ungleichheit hat sich seitdem nur noch vergrößert nicht gleichmäßig in allen Teilen des Landes. Prognosen zeigen, dass das Ungleichgewicht in den kommenden Jahrzehnten mit fortschreitender globaler Erwärmung zunehmen wird, möglicherweise auf bis zu 15 zu 1, wenn die Emissionen von Schadstoffen, die den Planeten erwärmen, wie Kohlendioxid, weiter ansteigen. „Wenn ich aktuelle Ereignisse mit Trends oder Mustern vergleiche, erinnere ich mich daran, dass die aktuellen Ereignisse selbst die Trends und Muster ausmachen“, sagte Deke Arndt, Leiterin der Klimaüberwachungsabteilung am NCEI. ""Dies ist ein Echtzeit-Einblick in das, was wir in ein paar Jahren ""neueste Trends"" nennen werden."" „Diese Woche war ein genauer Blick auf die DNA dessen, was wir im großen Ganzen sehen: Im Vergleich zu historischen Normen übertrifft extreme Hitze weiterhin extreme Kälte an fast jedem Ort, zu jeder Jahreszeit und zu jeder Tageszeit in den USA.“ Während einzelne Monate noch von diesem Trend abweichen werden, ist klar, dass das Verhältnis von Rekordhochs zu Rekordtiefs auf lange Sicht jetzt sowohl Rekordhochs als auch rekordwarme Nachttemperaturen stark begünstigt. Dies steht im Einklang mit Computermodellprojektionen einer sich erwärmenden Welt. Mit anderen Worten, wenn Sie 70-Grad-Februartage in Washington, D.C. mögen, haben Sie Glück. Die Chancen stehen (zunehmend) immer zu Ihren Gunsten."	Hier ist, warum es gerade so verdammt heiß ist	true
b27e8cff	Australiens Great Barrier Reef ist eines der weltweit größten Reservoirs an Biodiversität. Als Weltkulturerbe wird es derzeit von ungewöhnlich heißen Meerestemperaturen angegriffen, was zu einer weit verbreiteten Korallenbleiche führt, die die Riffe schädigt und in einigen Fällen sogar tötet. Nun stellt eine neue Studie von Wissenschaftlern des Australian Research Council fest, dass das anhaltende Bleichereignis hauptsächlich auf die vom Menschen verursachte globale Erwärmung zurückzuführen ist und dass, wenn die globale Erwärmung wie derzeit erwartet fortschreitet, „große Teile“ des Great Barrier Reef sterben könnten Mitte der 2030er Jahre. Die Studie wurde noch nicht zur Peer-Review in einer wissenschaftlichen Zeitschrift eingereicht. Und bis diese Studie überprüft und in einer wissenschaftlichen Zeitschrift veröffentlicht wird, sollten ihre Ergebnisse als vorläufig behandelt werden, aber im Einklang mit anderer neuerer klimawissenschaftlicher Forschung stehen. Die Studie untersucht, was dazu geführt hat, dass die Meerestemperaturen in der Korallenmeerregion, die einen Großteil des Great Barrier Reef umfasst, einschließlich der am stärksten betroffenen nördlichen Ausläufer, auf Rekordhöhen gestiegen sind. „Dieses Gebiet hat im vergangenen Jahrhundert einen starken Temperaturanstieg verzeichnet, wobei der März 2016 der wärmste seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen war“, schrieben die Forscher in einem Artikel, der am Donnerstag auf The Conversation veröffentlicht wurde, einer Website, die wissenschaftliche Arbeiten veröffentlicht. Korallenbleiche tritt auf, wenn Korallen die in ihrem Gewebe lebenden Algen ausstoßen und ihr Farbe und Nährstoffe verleihen. Diese durch Belastungen wie erhöhte Wassertemperatur und Verschmutzung verursachte Aktion lässt das Korallenskelett frei und macht es anfälliger für Hitzestress, Krankheiten und Verschmutzung. Meeresoberflächentemperaturen im März 2016. Bild: Mitchell Black Die Analyse verwendete Methoden, die auch zur Analyse anderer extremer Wetter- und Klimaereignisse verwendet wurden, darunter Rekordhitzewellen und extreme Niederschlagsereignisse. Die Wissenschaftler fanden heraus, dass die vom Menschen verursachte globale Erwärmung die Rekordtemperaturen im Ozean und damit verbundene Bleichereignisse, die in diesem Jahr beobachtet wurden, mindestens 175-mal wahrscheinlicher machte. Die Analyse ergab, dass der Klimawandel die Meerestemperaturen im März um 1 Grad Celsius oder 1,8 Grad Fahrenheit erhöhte. Korallenbleiche am Great Barrier Reef im Jahr 2016. Bild: Catlin Seaview Survey Die Studie geht davon aus, dass die diesjährige extreme Hitze wahrscheinlich alle zwei Jahre im Monat März bis zum Jahr 2034 auftritt. Die Ergebnisse der Analyse stimmen mit anderen Forschungsergebnissen überein prognostizierten das Massensterben von Korallenriffen auf der ganzen Welt bis zum Jahr 2050, da sich das Wasser erwärmt und die Toleranzgrenze vieler Korallenriffsysteme überschreitet. „Wir haben die Chancen gegen das Überleben eines der größten Naturwunder der Welt erhöht“ „Diese extremen Temperaturen werden in den 2030er Jahren alltäglich werden und die Ökosysteme des Great Barrier Reef stark belasten“, sagte Hauptautor Andrew King vom ARC Exzellenzzentrum für Klimasystemwissenschaft, in einer Erklärung. „Wir haben die Chancen gegen das Überleben eines der größten Naturwunder der Welt belastet“, sagte er. Obwohl die Studie noch von Fachleuten begutachtet werden muss, werden die Methoden zur Erkennung der Rolle des Klimawandels bei Extremereignissen immer fester in der Gemeinschaft der Klimawissenschaftler etabliert. „Wir hoffen, bald eine umfassendere Version dieser Analyse zur Peer-Review vorlegen zu können“, sagte King in einem Interview mit Mashable. Solche Studien zur Zuordnung von Extremereignissen wurden verwendet, um den Einfluss der vom Menschen verursachten globalen Erwärmung auf andere extreme Temperaturereignisse zu erkennen. Für diese Studie untersuchten die Forscher Temperaturdaten und Computermodellsimulationen, die nur natürliche Faktoren enthielten, die das Klima verändern, im Vergleich zu Simulationen, die menschliche Emissionen von Treibhausgasen beinhalten. Sie fanden heraus, dass die Simulationen, die Treibhausgase enthalten, am besten zu den Temperaturdaten passen, und berechneten mithilfe statistischer Techniken die Menge der Meereserwärmung, die der vom Menschen verursachten globalen Erwärmung zugeschrieben werden sollte, etwas, das als „fraktional zuordenbares Risiko“ bekannt ist. In einem Blogbeitrag sagten die Forscher, dass sie die Ergebnisse vor der Peer-Review veröffentlicht hätten, „aufgrund der schwerwiegenden Natur ihrer Ergebnisse und der Bedeutung des Great Barrier Reef für alle Australier“. „Wir sind von den Ergebnissen überzeugt, weil diese Art von Zuordnungsstudien gut etabliert sind, aber was wir herausgefunden haben, erfordert dringendes Handeln, wenn wir das Riff erhalten wollen“, sagte King. „Aus diesem Grund hielten wir es für wichtig, unsere Ergebnisse so schnell wie möglich zu veröffentlichen.“ Korallenriffe als Stolperdraht für „gefährliche Eingriffe“ in das Klima Die neue Analyse liefert weitere Beweise für diejenigen, die argumentieren, dass die globale Erwärmung möglicherweise bereits „gefährliche Eingriffe in das Klimasystem“ verursacht. Dieser vage Satz aus einem UN-Klimaabkommen von 1992 legte fest, woran die Nationen der Welt arbeiten sollten, um die Emissionen von Treibhausgasen wie Kohlendioxid und Methan zu reduzieren.

April von 172 Ländern unterzeichnet wurde, behält dieses Ziel als oberstes Ziel bei, ohne es zu definieren. Diese neue Analyse deutet darauf hin, dass wir bereits „gefährliches“ Territorium betreten haben. „Der Schaden am Riff ist ein sehr deutlicher Indikator für den Schaden, den unsere Treibhausgasemissionen dem Planeten zufügen“, sagte King. „Hoffentlich wird diese starke Bleiche dazu beitragen, Maßnahmen auszulösen, damit wir unsere Emissionen eindämmen können.“ Ein Vorher-Nachher-Bild der Bleiche in Amerikanisch-Samoa. Das erste Bild wurde im Dezember 2014 aufgenommen. Das zweite Bild wurde im Februar 2015 aufgenommen.

Die im Korallenmeer beobachtete Bleiche ist Teil dieser Veranstaltung. Heidi Cullen, die leitende Wissenschaftlerin von Climate Central in New Jersey, die ein Konsortium von Forschern leitet, die Studien zur Zuordnung von Extremereignissen durchführen, sagte gegenüber Mashable, dass diese neue Analyse „den hohen Tribut der Verbrennung fossiler Brennstoffe deutlich macht“. „Es ist die ultimative Alarmglocke, dass wir unsere Treibhausgasemissionen sofort drastisch reduzieren müssen“, sagte sie. Cullen war an der neuen Studie nicht beteiligt. Die Prognose, dass ein Großteil des Great Barrier Reef in den nächsten Jahrzehnten zugrunde gehen könnte, könnte sich als zu pessimistisch erweisen, da andere Forschungsergebnisse gezeigt haben, dass einige Korallenarten überraschend widerstandsfähig gegenüber dem Stress durch wechselnde Meerestemperaturen sind. In einer Pressemitteilung vom 29. März gab die Australian Coral Bleaching Task Force bekannt, dass die nördlichen Teile des Great Barrier Reef in den Fängen des intensivsten Korallenbleichereignisses sind, das dort je verzeichnet wurde. Die Task Force, bestehend aus 10 australischen Forschungseinrichtungen, traf ihre Entscheidung, nachdem sie Luftaufnahmen von mehr als 500 Korallenriffen von Cairns im Norden bis nach Papua-Neuguinea abgeschlossen hatte. „Dies war die traurigste Forschungsreise meines Lebens“, sagte Prof. Terry Hughes, Vorsitzender der National Coral Bleaching Taskforce, in einer Pressemitteilung. „Fast ausnahmslos zeigte jedes Riff, über das wir geflogen sind, ein konstant hohes Maß an Bleiche, vom Riffhang bis hinauf zur Spitze des Riffs“, sagte Hughes. „Wir sind 4.000 Kilometer in den unberührtesten Teilen des Great Barrier Reef geflogen , und sah nur vier Riffe, die nicht gebleicht wurden. Der Schweregrad ist viel größer als bei früheren Bleichereignissen in den Jahren 2002 oder 1998.“ Das anhaltende globale Bleichereignis ist das am längsten andauernde, das jemals beobachtet wurde, und erst das dritte, das jemals beobachtet wurde. Es ist im wärmsten Jahr seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen aufgetreten, das 2015 stattfand, und in den beiden ungewöhnlich mildesten Monaten auf der Erde, die jeweils im Januar und Februar stattfanden. „Dies war die traurigste Forschungsreise meines Lebens“ Dies ist auf Rekordtemperaturen in den Ozeanen auf der ganzen Welt zurückzuführen, die teilweise durch ein starkes El Niño-Ereignis im tropischen Pazifik verursacht wurden.

Der Gesetzgeber hat sich zeitweise Forschungen zu eigen gemacht, die die Mainstream-Klimawissenschaft während einer Anhörung darüber in Frage stellen, wie Technologie zur Bekämpfung der globalen Erwärmung eingesetzt werden kann. Ein führender Klimawissenschaftler, der vor dem Gremium aussagte, verbrachte einen Großteil der zwei Stunden damit, falsche Angaben zu korrigieren. Ziel der Anhörung war es, sich darauf zu konzentrieren, wie Technologie zur Anpassung an den Klimawandel eingesetzt werden kann. Aber die Anhörung wandte sich häufig den Grundlagen der Klimawissenschaft zu. Viele der Fragen von Republikanern und Demokraten richteten sich gleichermaßen an Philip Duffy, Präsident des Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts und ehemaliger leitender Berater des U.S. Global Change Research Program. Der Abgeordnete Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) sagte, er sei beunruhigt darüber, dass die etablierte Klimawissenschaft vom Komitee nicht mehr in Frage gestellt worden sei, das Klimawissenschaftler des Bundes beschuldigt habe, Klimadaten in betrügerischer Absicht manipuliert und ihre Aufzeichnungen vorgeladen zu haben. „Ich bin ein bisschen beunruhigt darüber, Nr. 1, immer wieder höre ich: ‚Sprich niemals darüber, ob die Menschheit die Hauptursache für die Temperatur- und Klimaänderungen ist'“, sagte er. „Das ist ein bisschen beunruhigend, wenn man uns in einer Sitzung des Wissenschaftsausschusses ständig in den Kopf schlägt, wo wir eigentlich alle offen für unterschiedliche Standpunkte sein sollten.“ Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), Vorsitzender des Komitees, hat einen gestern im Wall Street Journal veröffentlichten Meinungsartikel zu Protokoll gegeben, in dem behauptet wird, der Meeresspiegel steige nicht aufgrund des Klimawandels, eine Ansicht, die Tausende von wissenschaftlichen Studien widerlegt. Das Stück wurde von Fred Singer geschrieben, der dem Heartland Institute in Chicago, Illinois, angehört, das die Ablehnung der Mainstream-Klimawissenschaft fördert. „Um die Herausforderungen des Klimawandels zu lösen, müssen wir zunächst die bestehenden Unsicherheiten anerkennen“, sagte Smith in seiner Eröffnungsrede. „Dann können wir darauf vertrauen, dass Innovationen und Technologie uns in die Lage versetzen werden, alle nachteiligen Folgen des Klimawandels abzumildern.“ An einer Stelle zeigte Smith eine Folie mit zwei Diagrammen, die seiner Meinung nach zeigten, dass die Anstiegsrate des Meeresspiegels nicht mit dem starken Anstieg des Verbrauchs fossiler Brennstoffe übereinstimmt. Als Smith darauf hinwies, dass die Anstiegsraten des Meeresspiegels im Vergleich zur Rate des Verbrauchs fossiler Brennstoffe nur geringfügig zugenommen haben, wies Duffy darauf hin, dass seine Karte von einer einzigen Gezeitenmessstation in der Nähe von San Francisco stammte und dass der Meeresspiegel mit unterschiedlichen Raten ansteigt auf der ganzen Welt. Smith zeigte keine steigenden atmosphärischen CO 2 -Werte oder Temperaturen, die beide in den letzten Jahrzehnten mit zunehmenden Emissionen stetig gestiegen sind. Jedes Mal, wenn Erde oder Gestein oder was auch immer in den Meeren abgelagert wird, zwingt das den Meeresspiegel zum Ansteigen, weil Sie jetzt weniger Platz in diesen Ozeanen haben, weil sich der Boden nach oben bewegt. Repräsentant Mo Brooks (R-AL) „Die Geschwindigkeit des globalen Anstiegs des Meeresspiegels hat sich beschleunigt und ist jetzt viermal schneller als vor 100 Jahren“, sagte Duffy zu Smith als Antwort auf die Diagramme. ""Ist diese Tabelle dann ungenau?"" fragte Smith. „Es ist genau, aber es repräsentiert nicht, was weltweit passiert; es repräsentiert, was in San Francisco passiert“, sagte Duffy. Der Abgeordnete Mo Brooks (R-AL) befragte Duffy zu den Faktoren, die zum Anstieg des Meeresspiegels beitragen, und wies darauf hin, dass Landabsenkungen ebenso eine Rolle spielen wie menschliche Aktivitäten. Brooks sagte dann, dass Erosion eine bedeutende Rolle beim Anstieg des Meeresspiegels spiele, was keine Idee ist, die von Mainstream-Klimaforschern angenommen wird. Er sagte, die kalifornische Küste und die weißen Klippen von Dover stürzten jedes Jahr ins Meer, und das trage zum Anstieg des Meeresspiegels bei. Er sagte auch, dass Schlick, der von den großen Flüssen der Welt, einschließlich des Mississippi, des Amazonas und des Nils, in den Ozean gespült wird, zum Anstieg des Meeresspiegels beiträgt. ""Jedes Mal, wenn Erde oder Gestein oder was auch immer in den Meeren abgelagert wird, zwingt das den Meeresspiegel zum Ansteigen, weil Sie jetzt weniger Platz in diesen Ozeanen haben, weil sich der Boden nach oben bewegt"", sagte Brooks. Duffy antwortete: ""Ich bin mir ziemlich sicher, dass dies auf menschlicher Zeitskala winzige Effekte sind."" Brooks fügte hinzu, dass das Eis in der Antarktis wächst. Das galt vor ein paar Jahren, und Wissenschaftler sagen, dass es die Theorie der globalen Erwärmung nicht widerlegt, da unterschiedliche Faktoren die Schmelzraten der Arktis und Antarktis beeinflussen. „Wir haben Satellitenaufzeichnungen, die eindeutig eine Schrumpfung der antarktischen Eisdecke und eine Beschleunigung dieser Schrumpfung dokumentieren“, sagte Duffy. „Es tut mir leid, aber ich weiß nicht, woher Sie Ihre Informationen bekommen, aber die Daten, die ich gesehen habe, legen nahe –“, sagte Brooks. Duffy antwortete: ""Das National Snow and Ice Data Center und die National Aeronautics and Space Administration."" „Nun, ich habe eine NASA-Basis in meinem Distrikt, und anscheinend sagen sie Ihnen eines und mir etwas anderes“, sagte Brooks. „Aber es gibt viele Studien, die in Bezug auf die Antarktis zeigen, dass die gesamte Eisdecke, insbesondere die über Land, zunimmt und nicht abnimmt. Nun, Sie könnten ein anderes Argument vorbringen, wenn Sie über Grönland oder die sprechen wollen Arktis."" Anfang dieses Jahres stellten NASA-Forscher fest, dass sich der Eisverlust in der Antarktis im letzten Jahrzehnt beschleunigt hat. Im weiteren Sinne erreichte die Meereisausdehnung an beiden Polen im vergangenen Jahr ein Rekordtief. Wissenschaftler bemühen sich, die Veränderungen in der Antarktis besser zu verstehen, da ein Großteil ihres Eises an Land liegt, was bedeutet, dass es den Anstieg des Meeresspiegels auf der ganzen Welt vorantreiben könnte, wenn es schmilzt. Rep. Bill Posey (R-FL) sagte, Wissenschaftler sagten in den 1970er Jahren, dass sich die Erde abkühle, ein beliebtes Gesprächsthema von Klimaskeptikern und das Thema eines gefälschten Time-Magazin-Cover, das zu einem Mem geworden ist. Duffy korrigierte ihn und sagte, dass dies damals im Wesentlichen eine Ausreißerposition gewesen sei und dass Wissenschaftler vor langer Zeit festgestellt hätten, dass Menschen den Planeten erwärmen. Posey fragte auch, wie Kohlendioxid im Permafrost in der Zeit vor der Existenz von Menschen eingefangen werden könnte. Duffy sagte ihm, dass es aus nicht zerfallenem organischem Material stamme. Menschliche Aktivitäten führen jetzt dazu, dass sich die Arktis erwärmt und den Boden auftaut, wodurch der Kohlenstoff in die Atmosphäre freigesetzt wird, sagte Duffy. Posey fragte dann nach Theorien darüber, dass die Erwärmung für Lebensräume und Menschen von Vorteil sei. „Was sagen Sie Leuten, die die Theorie aufstellen, dass die Erde, während sie sich weiter erwärmt, zu ihrer normalen Temperatur zurückkehrt?“ fragte Posey. „Schauen Sie, wenn Sie eine Temperatur über der heutigen Temperatur als normal charakterisieren möchten, können Sie das tun, aber das bedeutet nicht, dass dies ein Planet ist, auf dem wir leben wollen“, sagte Duffy. „Ich möchte nicht philosophisch werden; ich versuche hier bei der Wissenschaft zu bleiben“, sagte Posey. „Ich werde nicht philosophisch, ich werde extrem praktisch“, sagte Duffy. „Ich bin äußerst praktisch – wenn wir den Planeten um 2 oder 3 Grad erwärmen lassen, wird der Meeresspiegel um mehrere zehn Meter ansteigen, und die Gemeinde, in der ich lebe, wird im Wesentlichen aufhören zu existieren.“ Posey antwortete: „Ich glaube nicht, dass irgendjemand bestreitet, dass die Erde wärmer wird; ich denke, was nicht klar ist, ist die genaue Menge, wer was verursacht hat, und dahin zu kommen, ist, denke ich, wo wir damit hin wollen Komitee.""

a2580111	Das älteste und dickste Meereis der Arktis beginnt aufzubrechen und öffnet Gewässer nördlich von Grönland, die normalerweise sogar im Sommer gefroren sind. Dieses Phänomen – das noch nie zuvor aufgezeichnet wurde – ist in diesem Jahr aufgrund warmer Winde und einer durch den Klimawandel verursachten Hitzewelle auf der Nordhalbkugel zweimal aufgetreten. Ein Meteorologe beschrieb den Eisverlust als „beängstigend“. Andere sagten, es könnte Wissenschaftler dazu zwingen, ihre Theorien darüber zu revidieren, welcher Teil der Arktis der Erwärmung am längsten standhalten wird. Das Meer vor der Nordküste Grönlands ist normalerweise so gefroren, dass es bis vor kurzem als „das letzte Eisgebiet“ bezeichnet wurde, weil man annahm, dass dies der letzte nördliche Widerstand gegen die schmelzenden Auswirkungen eines heißeren Planeten sein würde. Aber ungewöhnliche Temperaturspitzen im Februar und Anfang dieses Monats haben es anfällig für Winde gemacht, die das Eis weiter von der Küste weggetrieben haben als je zuvor seit Beginn der Satellitenaufzeichnungen in den 1970er Jahren. „Fast das gesamte Eis nördlich von Grönland ist ziemlich zerschmettert und aufgebrochen und daher beweglicher“, sagte Ruth Mottram vom Dänischen Meteorologischen Institut. „Offenes Wasser vor der Nordküste Grönlands ist ungewöhnlich. Dieses Gebiet wurde oft als „das letzte Eisgebiet“ bezeichnet, da vermutet wird, dass hier das letzte mehrjährige Meereis in der Arktis vorkommen wird. Die Ereignisse der letzten Woche deuten darauf hin, dass das letzte Eisgebiet tatsächlich weiter westlich liegen könnte.“ Das Eis nördlich von Grönland ist normalerweise aufgrund des Transpolar Drift Stream, eines von zwei großen Wettermustern, die Eis von Sibirien über die Arktis zur Küste treiben, wo es sich verdichtet, besonders verdichtet. Walt Meier, leitender Forschungswissenschaftler am US National Snow and Ice Data Center, sagte: „Das Eis dort kann nirgendwo anders hin, also häuft es sich an. Im Durchschnitt ist es über vier Meter dick und kann zu 20 Meter dicken oder dickeren Graten aufgeschichtet werden. Dieses dicke, verdichtete Eis lässt sich im Allgemeinen nicht leicht bewegen. „Das war jedoch im vergangenen Winter (im Februar und März) und jetzt nicht der Fall. Das Eis wird von den Winden von der Küste weggedrückt.“ Fragen und Antworten Wie wirkt sich der Klimawandel auf die Arktis aus? Show Die Welt mag sich im vergangenen Jahrhundert um etwa 1 °C (1,8 °F) erwärmt haben, aber die Arktis übertrifft diesen globalen Durchschnitt bei weitem und erwärmt sich etwa doppelt so schnell wie der Rest der Welt. Stellenweise war die Erwärmungsrate erstaunlich. Die November in der alaskischen Stadt Utqiaġvik, ehemals Barrow, sind jetzt 5,5 °C wärmer als 1979. Im Sommer 2019 wurden Teile Grönlands durch eine arktische Hitzewelle um 40 °C heißer als normal. Die Arktis wird von Meereis dominiert, im Gegensatz zur Antarktis, die im Wesentlichen eine riesige Landeisdecke ist. Da sich der Ozean und die Atmosphäre erwärmen, schrumpft das Meereis laut Nasa um etwa 13 % pro Jahrzehnt seit 1979. Die strahlend weiße Eisoberfläche, bekannt als Albedo, weicht dem dunklen Ozean, was bedeutet, dass das Sonnenlicht eher absorbiert als reflektiert wird, was den Erwärmungseffekt verstärkt. Diese schnellen und beispiellosen Veränderungen verändern die Arktis und bedrohen traditionelle Lebensweisen, so Wissenschaftler der US-Regierung in einem Bericht von 2019. Das Meereis ist jünger, dünner, zerbrechlicher und weniger ausgedehnt, was die Jagd auf dem Eis schwieriger und gefährlicher macht. Das Meeresökosystem verändert sich, da wärmeres Wasser Fischarten dazu zwingt, sich in nördlichere Gewässer zurückzuziehen. Was für die Gemeinden in der Arktis eine große Herausforderung darstellt, ist ein Segen für die Schifffahrtsindustrie, die das Gebiet leichter befahren kann. Diese Aufgabe wird noch einfacher, sobald die Arktis im Sommer eisfrei ist, was bereits in den 2040er Jahren prognostiziert wird. Eis lässt sich aufgrund eines Erwärmungstrends, der sich in den letzten 15 Jahren beschleunigt hat, leichter herumblasen. „Die Ausdünnung erreicht sogar den kältesten Teil der Arktis mit dem dicksten Eis. Es ist also ein ziemlich dramatischer Hinweis auf die Transformation des arktischen Meereises und des arktischen Klimas.“ „Beängstigend“, schrieb Thomas Lavergne, Wissenschaftler am Norwegischen Meteorologischen Institut, in einem Retweet eines Satelliten-Gifs des blauen Wassers, das weißes Eis durchdringt und Hunderte von Kilometern der grönländischen Küste freilegt. Der offene Wasser-/Niedrigkonzentrationsfleck Nord für Grönland ist also immer noch da (und bewegt sich langsam nach Westen). Schön und beängstigend. Von https://t.co/jPx1JmNayA https://t.co/hGstLYafcW – Thomas Lavergne (@lavergnetho) 13. August 2018 Er sagte, dies würde dickere Eisbrocken durch die Fram- oder Nares-Straße in wärmere südliche Gewässer spülen . „Ich kann nicht sagen, wie lange dieser offene Wasserfleck offen bleiben wird, aber selbst wenn er in ein paar Tagen geschlossen wird, wird der Schaden angerichtet: Das dicke alte Meereis wird von der Küste weg in ein Gebiet geschoben worden sein, wo es ist wird leichter schmelzen“, fügte er hinzu. Die diesjährigen Öffnungen werden mehr vom Wind als vom Schmelzen angetrieben, aber sie sind während zweier Temperaturspitzen aufgetreten. Im Februar ist die Wetterstation Kap Morris Jesup in der Region normalerweise unter -20 ° C, aber Anfang dieses Jahres gab es 10 Tage über dem Gefrierpunkt und warme Winde, die das Eis von der Küste lösten. Die Ausdehnung des arktischen Meereises betrug am 15. August 2018 5,7 Millionen Quadratkilometer (2,2 Millionen Quadratmeilen). Die orange Linie zeigt die durchschnittliche Ausdehnung von 1981 bis 2010 für diesen Tag. Foto: NSIDC Letzte Woche öffnete sich der Riss wieder, nachdem Kap Morris Jesup kurzzeitig ein Rekordhoch von 17 ° C registrierte und starke Südwinde auf 11 Knoten zunahmen. Experten sagen voraus, dass die Küstenmeere wieder zufrieren werden, aber wahrscheinlich später als normal. „Ich denke, dass die solare Erwärmung der Wassersäule während dieser Öffnung zunehmen wird und dies das Einfrieren und die Eisbildung verzögern wird“, sagte Rasmus Tage Tonboe, Meereisexperte am Dänischen Meteorologischen Institut. Die neuesten Messwerte des norwegischen Eisdienstes zeigen, dass die arktische Eisbedeckung in der Region Svalbard diese Woche 40 % unter dem Durchschnitt für diese Jahreszeit seit 1981 liegt. Im vergangenen Monat haben mindestens 14 Tage im vergangenen Monat Rekordtiefs erreicht in dieser Region. Obwohl dünneres Eis anderswo in der Arktis bedeutet, dass dieses Jahr insgesamt wahrscheinlich kein Rekordtief wird, stimmen sie mit Vorhersagen überein, dass es zwischen 2030 und 2050 kein Sommereis im Arktischen Ozean geben wird. Keld Qvistgaard, der Eisdienst Koordinator in Dänemark, sagte, dies sei nicht das erste Mal, dass eine Lücke zwischen der Küste und dem Haupteis aufgetaucht sei, aber die vom 1. bis 5. August entstandene sei in ihrem Ausmaß anders. „Diese Veranstaltung ist ziemlich groß und erstreckt sich bis in den Westen von Kap Morris Jesup. Das ist ungewöhnlich“, sagte er. Neben der Verringerung der Eisbedeckung wirft das Eindringen des Ozeans Bedenken hinsichtlich Rückkopplungen auf, die die Erde in einen Treibhauszustand kippen könnten. Die ungewöhnlichen arktischen Temperaturen haben Klimawissenschaftler seit Anfang des Jahres alarmiert. Während des sonnenlosen Winters ließ eine Hitzewelle Bedenken aufkommen, dass der Polarwirbel erodieren könnte. Dazu gehört der Golfstrom, der aufgrund des schmelzenden grönländischen Eises und der Erwärmung des Ozeans auf seinem schwächsten Stand seit 1.600 Jahren ist. Bei geringerer Zirkulation von Wasser und Luft neigen Wettersysteme dazu, länger zu verweilen. Eine ruhende Heißfront wurde für Rekordtemperaturen in Lappland und Waldbrände in Sibirien, weiten Teilen Skandinaviens und anderswo am Polarkreis verantwortlich gemacht.

9d0cdfe6	Teilen Sie diese Geschichte: Eisbären gedeihen weiter, auch wenn die Alarmisten der globalen Erwärmung so tun, als würden sie sterben Eisbären gedeihen weiter, auch wenn die Alarmisten der globalen Erwärmung so tun, als würden sie sterben Susan Crockford: Eisbären gedeihen und machen sie zu falschen Ikonen und falschen Idolen , für Alarmisten der globalen Erwärmung Foto von Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press Inhalt des Artikels Eine mächtige Tatsache über Eisbären erhebt sich langsam über die Nachricht einer drohenden Katastrophe, die endlos von den Medien wiederholt wird: Mehr als 15.000 Eisbären sind seit 2005 nicht verschwunden. Obwohl das Ausmaß von das sommerliche Meereis nach 2006 abrupt auf ein Niveau abfiel, das nicht vor 2050 erwartet wurde, der vorhergesagte 67-prozentige Rückgang der Eisbärenzahlen ist einfach nicht eingetreten. Vielmehr sind die weltweiten Eisbärenzahlen stabil oder leicht verbessert. Die Widerstandsfähigkeit des Eisbären hätte das Ende seiner Verwendung als geschätzte Ikone des Untergangs der globalen Erwärmung bedeuten sollen, aber das tat es nicht. Der Alarmismus wird nicht kampflos verschwinden. Ein Teil dieses Kampfes beinhaltet einen wissenschaftlichen Konflikt über Transparenz in der Eisbärenforschung. Meine genaue Untersuchung der jüngsten Forschungen hat gezeigt, dass innerhalb der Eisbärenliteratur und zwischen dieser Literatur und öffentlichen Äußerungen einiger Forscher ernsthafte Widersprüche bestehen. Zum Beispiel erfuhr der kanadische Eisbärenbiologe Ian Stirling in den 1970er Jahren, dass das Meereis im Frühjahr in der südlichen Beaufortsee regelmäßig so dick wird, dass Robben davonziehen, die einheimischen Eisbären ihrer Beute berauben und ihre Zahl sinken lässt. Aber diese Tatsache, die in mehr als einem Dutzend wissenschaftlicher Arbeiten dokumentiert ist, wird heute nicht als Teil der Eisbärenökologie diskutiert. In diesen Tagen der politisierten Wissenschaft erwähnen weder Stirling noch seine Kollegen öffentlich die verheerenden Auswirkungen des dicken Quelleises in der Beaufortsee; Stattdessen implizieren sie in jüngsten Veröffentlichungen, dass die hungernden Bären, die sie gesehen haben, Opfer von reduziertem Meereis im Sommer sind, das ihrer Meinung nach die Beute der Bären erschöpft hat. Es gibt auch deutliche Hinweise darauf, dass es in den Jahren 2014–16 erneut zu dickem Frühlingseis kam, wobei die Auswirkungen auf Eisbären in ähnlicher Weise als Auswirkungen der globalen Erwärmung dargestellt wurden. Wir entschuldigen uns, aber dieses Video konnte nicht geladen werden. Tippen Sie hier, um andere Videos von unserem Team zu sehen. Versuchen Sie, Ihren Browser zu aktualisieren, oder Eisbären gedeihen weiter, auch wenn die Alarmisten der globalen Erwärmung weiterhin so tun, als würden sie sterben. Zurück zum Video Inhalt des Artikels Die Widerstandsfähigkeit des Eisbären hätte das Ende seiner Verwendung als Ikone des Untergangs der globalen Erwärmung bedeuten sollen Ein Grund dafür, dass die Vorhersagen von 2007 über das zukünftige Überleben der Eisbären so weit von der Basis lagen, ist, dass das vom amerikanischen Biologen Steven Amstrup (jetzt bei Polar Bears International, eine NGO) ging trotz der Erfahrung in der Beaufortsee davon aus, dass ein Rückgang der Eisbärenpopulation durch weniger Sommereis verursacht werden würde. Darüber hinaus waren Amstrup und andere Modellierer zu zuversichtlich in ihrer Behauptung, dass Sommereis für das Überleben der Eisbären von entscheidender Bedeutung sei, und sie hatten nur wenige Daten, auf die sie ihre Annahme stützen könnten, dass weniger Sommereis die Beute der Eisbären verwüsten würde. Daher waren viele Wissenschaftler überrascht, als andere Forscher später feststellten, dass Ringel- und Bartrobben (die Hauptbeute der Eisbären) nördlich der Beringstraße besonders von einer längeren Freiwassersaison profitierten, was der Fischerei besonders förderlich ist: Diese Robben tun am meisten ihrer Fütterung im Sommer. Mehr Nahrung für Robben im Sommer bedeutet mehr fette Robbenbabys, die Eisbären im folgenden Frühjahr fressen können, ein Ergebnis, das wahrscheinlich in der gesamten Arktis zutrifft. Solange Eisbären im Frühjahr viele Robbenbabys zu fressen haben, werden sie fett genug, um selbst ein längeres Sommerfasten als üblich zu überleben. Und obwohl es stimmt, dass Studien in einigen Regionen zeigen, dass Eisbären leichter sind als in den 1980er Jahren, gibt es keine Beweise dafür, dass mehr Menschen verhungern oder zu dünn werden, um sich fortzupflanzen, weil es im Sommer weniger Eis gibt. Natürlich bekommen nicht alle Bären im Frühjahr genug zu fressen. Hunger war schon immer die häufigste natürliche Todesursache für Eisbären, was auf eine Reihe von Faktoren zurückzuführen ist, darunter Konkurrenz, Verletzungen, Karies und Krankheiten. Einige Krebsarten induzieren ein Muskelschwundsyndrom, das zu einem schnelleren Gewichtsverlust als üblich führt. Dies ist wahrscheinlich das, was dem abgemagerten Bären von Baffin Island passiert ist, der im Juli 2017 auf Video aufgenommen und Ende letzten Jahres von National Geographic beworben wurde. Die Videografen behaupteten, es zeige, wie Hunger aufgrund von Meereisverlust aussah – eine unplausible Schlussfolgerung angesichts der Jahreszeit, der isolierten Natur des Vorfalls und der Tatsache, dass das Meereis in diesem Jahr nicht stärker zurückgegangen war als zuvor. Die Werbegeschichte wird unten fortgesetzt. Diese Anzeige wurde noch nicht geladen, aber Ihr Artikel wird unten fortgesetzt. Inhalt des Artikels Dieses Video über den verhungernden Bären könnte ein paar leichtgläubigere Menschen davon überzeugt haben, dass es nur noch Hunderte von Eisbären auf der Welt gibt. Aber es motivierte auch andere, den Bericht der Roten Liste der International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) für 2015 zu finden, der die weltweite Anzahl von Eisbären auf irgendwo zwischen 22.000 und 31.000 oder etwa 26.000 schätzt, leicht gestiegen von 20.000 bis 25.000 oder etwa 22.500. im Jahr 2005. Neuere Zählungen, die nicht in die Bewertung von 2015 aufgenommen wurden, erhöhen möglicherweise die Gesamtzahl um weitere 2.500. Dieser Anstieg mag statistisch nicht signifikant sein, aber es ist definitiv nicht der Rückgang um 67 Prozent, der angesichts der vorherrschenden Eisbedingungen vorhergesagt wurde. Das Scheitern des Eisbären-Überlebensmodells von 2007 ist eine einfache Tatsache, die den Mythos widerlegt, dass Eisbären auf dem Weg zum Aussterben sind. Obwohl Videos von hungernden Bären und wissenschaftlich unbedeutende Forschungsberichte immer noch in den Nachrichten sind, ändern sie nichts an den Tatsachen: Eisbären gedeihen prächtig und machen sie zu falschen Ikonen und falschen Idolen für Alarmisten der globalen Erwärmung.

bae4220d	"(CNN) Regierungen auf der ganzen Welt müssen ""schnelle, weitreichende und beispiellose Veränderungen in allen Aspekten der Gesellschaft"" vornehmen, um katastrophale Ausmaße der globalen Erwärmung zu vermeiden, heißt es in einem krassem neuen Bericht der globalen wissenschaftlichen Autorität zum Klimawandel. Der am Montag vom Weltklimarat der Vereinten Nationen (IPCC) veröffentlichte Bericht besagt, dass der Planet bereits 2030 die entscheidende Schwelle von 1,5 Grad Celsius (2,7 Grad Fahrenheit) über dem vorindustriellen Niveau erreichen wird, was das Risiko einer extremen Dürre erhöht , Waldbrände, Überschwemmungen und Nahrungsmittelknappheit für Hunderte Millionen Menschen. Das Datum, das weit in die Lebenszeit vieler heute lebender Menschen fällt, basiert auf den aktuellen Niveaus der Treibhausgasemissionen. Der Planet hat bereits zwei Drittel des Weges dorthin zurückgelegt, wobei sich die globalen Temperaturen um etwa 1 Grad C erwärmt haben. Um zu vermeiden, noch höher zu gehen, sind in den nächsten Jahren erhebliche Maßnahmen erforderlich. „Das ist besorgniserregend, weil wir wissen, dass es so viel mehr Probleme gibt, wenn wir die globale Erwärmung auf 1,5 Grad überschreiten, darunter mehr Hitzewellen und heiße Sommer, ein stärkerer Anstieg des Meeresspiegels und für viele Teile der Welt schlimmere Dürren und Regenextreme.“ Andrew King, Dozent für Klimawissenschaften an der Universität von Melbourne, sagte in einer Erklärung. Die globalen Nettoemissionen von Kohlendioxid müssten bis 2030 um 45 % gegenüber dem Niveau von 2010 sinken und um 2050 „netto null“ erreichen, um die Erwärmung bei etwa 1,5 Grad C zu halten. Eine Senkung der Emissionen auf dieses Maß wäre zwar technisch möglich, würde aber eine umfassende Verbreitung erfordern Veränderungen in Energie, Industrie, Gebäuden, Transport und Städten, heißt es in dem Bericht. „Das Fenster, um die globale Erwärmung unter 1,5 Grad C zu halten, schließt sich schnell, und die aktuellen Emissionszusagen der Unterzeichner des Pariser Abkommens tragen nicht dazu bei, dass wir dieses Ziel erreichen“, fügte King hinzu. Meereis ist vom NASA-Forschungsflugzeug Operation IceBridge vor der Nordwestküste Grönlands zu sehen. Wissenschaftler sagen, dass die Arktis eine der am stärksten vom Klimawandel betroffenen Regionen ist. Folgen vergangener Untätigkeit Der Bericht macht deutlich, dass der Klimawandel bereits stattfindet – und was als nächstes kommt, könnte noch schlimmer werden, wenn nicht dringend internationale politische Maßnahmen ergriffen werden. „Eine der Schlüsselbotschaften, die sehr deutlich aus diesem Bericht hervorgeht, ist, dass wir bereits die Folgen einer globalen Erwärmung von 1 Grad Celsius sehen, unter anderem durch extremeres Wetter, steigenden Meeresspiegel und abnehmendes arktisches Meereis“, sagte Panmao Zhai, Co-Vorsitzender der IPCC-Arbeitsgruppe I. Selbst wenn die Erwärmung bei oder knapp unter 1,5 Grad C gehalten wird, werden die Auswirkungen weitreichend und erheblich sein. Die Temperaturen während sommerlicher Hitzewellen, wie sie gerade in diesem Sommer in ganz Europa aufgetreten sind, dürften um 3 Grad C steigen, heißt es in dem Bericht. Korallenriffe werden ebenfalls drastisch betroffen sein, wobei zwischen 70 und 90 % voraussichtlich absterben werden, einschließlich Australiens Great Barrier Reef. Die Länder der südlichen Hemisphäre werden zu den schlechter gestellten gehören, heißt es in dem Bericht, „die voraussichtlich die größten Auswirkungen auf das Wirtschaftswachstum aufgrund des Klimawandels erfahren werden, falls die globale Erwärmung zunimmt“. Der Bericht unterstreicht, wie selbst die kleinste Erhöhung des Basisziels die Auswirkungen der jüngsten Naturkatastrophen verschlimmern würde. „Jedes zusätzliche bisschen Erwärmung ist wichtig, zumal eine Erwärmung um 1,5 Grad oder mehr das Risiko erhöht, das mit lang anhaltenden oder irreversiblen Veränderungen verbunden ist, wie dem Verlust einiger Ökosysteme“, sagte Hans-Otto Pörtner, Co-Vorsitzender von IPCC Working Gruppe II. Der Bericht nennt konkrete Beispiele dafür, wie die Auswirkungen der globalen Erwärmung mit einem Anstieg um 1,5 Grad C im Vergleich zu einem Anstieg um 2 Grad C verringert würden: Der globale Meeresspiegel würde bis 2100 um 10 cm niedriger ansteigen. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit eines meereisfreien Arktischen Ozeans im Sommer einmal pro Jahrhundert statt mindestens einmal pro Jahrzehnt. Korallenriffe würden um 70 % bis 90 % zurückgehen, anstatt fast vollständig ausgelöscht zu werden. Dieses Diagramm des IPCC zeigt, wie die globalen Temperaturen auf eine plötzliche und drastische Reduzierung der Treibhausgasemissionen reagieren würden. Selbst bei sofortigem Handeln werden die globalen Temps immer noch über das Ziel hinausschießen, könnten aber im Laufe der Zeit wieder auf das Ziel sinken. „Möglich mit den Gesetzen der Chemie und Physik“ Der Bericht vom Montag wird seit drei Jahren erstellt und ist ein direktes Ergebnis des Pariser Klimaabkommens von 2015. Im Pariser Abkommen einigten sich 197 Staaten auf das Ziel, die globalen Temperaturen ""deutlich unter"" 2 Grad C über dem vorindustriellen Niveau zu halten und Anstrengungen zu unternehmen, sie auf 1,5 Grad C zu begrenzen. Die Vereinigten Staaten waren zunächst in dem Abkommen aber Präsident Donald Trump zog das Land anderthalb Jahre später heraus und behauptete, es sei dem Land gegenüber unfair. Die globale Erwärmung auf 1,5 Grad C zu begrenzen, sei „innerhalb der Gesetze der Chemie und Physik möglich“, sagte Jim Skea, Co-Vorsitzender der IPCC-Arbeitsgruppe III. ""Aber dazu wären beispiellose Veränderungen erforderlich."" „Internationale Zusammenarbeit ist absolut unerlässlich, um Emissionen und damit die globale Erwärmung und ihre Auswirkungen zu begrenzen sowie eine effektive und weit verbreitete Anpassung und Minderung zu koordinieren“, sagte Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, Fellow am Climate Change Research Centre der University of New South Wales . ""Die nächsten Jahre werden für die Entwicklung dieser Bemühungen entscheidend sein."" Ein Schlüsselthema werden negative Emissionen und groß angelegte Technologien zur Kohlenstoffwäsche sein, die die Menge in der Atmosphäre reduzieren und der anhaltenden Verschmutzung entgegenwirken können. Dem Bericht zufolge gibt es zwei Hauptwege, um Kohlenstoff aus der Atmosphäre zu entfernen: die Steigerung natürlicher Prozesse, die dies bereits tun, und experimentelle Technologien zur Speicherung oder Entfernung von Kohlenstoff. Alle Methoden ""befinden sich jedoch in unterschiedlichen Entwicklungsstadien und einige sind konzeptioneller als andere, da sie nicht in großem Maßstab getestet wurden"", warnte der Bericht. Sie werden auch ein erhebliches politisches Engagement weltweit erfordern, ebenso wie die Reduzierung der Menge an emittiertem Kohlenstoff. Trotz der düsteren Warnungen des Berichts gibt es keinen Hinweis darauf, dass eine solche Zusammenarbeit machbar sein wird, insbesondere angesichts der Haltung der Trump-Administration zu diesem Thema. „Heute haben die weltweit führenden wissenschaftlichen Experten gemeinsam bekräftigt, was Mutter Natur deutlich gemacht hat – dass wir uns einer dringenden und schnellen Transformation hin zu einer globalen sauberen Energiewirtschaft unterziehen müssen“, sagte der frühere US-Vizepräsident Al Gore. „Leider ist die Trump-Regierung bei ihrem kurzsichtigen Versuch, die schmutzigen Industrien für fossile Brennstoffe der Vergangenheit zu stützen, zu einem abtrünnigen Ausreißer geworden. Die Regierung steht in direktem Konflikt mit amerikanischen Unternehmen, Staaten, Städten und Bürgern, die die Transformation anführen.“"	Der Planet hat nur bis 2030 Zeit, um den katastrophalen Klimawandel einzudämmen, warnen Experten	true
65ebf51e	Die durchschnittliche Kohlendioxidkonzentration in der Erdatmosphäre überstieg im Mai 411 Teile pro Million. Im April – dem Vormonat – erreichte die Konzentration zum ersten Mal in der aufgezeichneten Geschichte 410 ppm. Dies sind die höchsten CO2-Werte in den 800.000 Jahren, für die wir gute Daten haben. Es wird erwartet, dass dies katastrophale Auswirkungen auf die menschliche Gesundheit und den Planeten haben wird. Wir haben eine ziemlich gute Vorstellung davon, wie die Erdatmosphäre in den letzten 800.000 Jahren ausgesehen hat. Menschen wie wir – Homo sapiens – haben sich vor etwa 200.000 Jahren entwickelt, aber Aufzeichnungen aus Eisbohrkernen enthüllen komplizierte Details der Geschichte unseres Planeten, lange bevor Menschen existierten. Indem sie mehr als 3 Kilometer tief in die Eisschilde über Grönland und der Antarktis bohren, können Wissenschaftler sehen, wie sich die Temperatur und der atmosphärische Kohlendioxidgehalt verändert haben. Aus dieser Aufzeichnung wissen wir, dass die Atmosphäre und die Luft, die wir atmen, noch nie so viel Kohlendioxid enthielten wie heute. Laut Beobachtungen am Mauna-Loa-Observatorium auf Hawaii überstieg der durchschnittliche monatliche CO2-Gehalt in der Atmosphäre im April zum ersten Mal in der aufgezeichneten Geschichte 410 Teile pro Million. Im Mai stieg diese Zahl laut Forschern des Scripps Institute of Oceanography an der University of California San Diego und der National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration auf über 411 ppm. Der Rekord ist kein Zufall – Menschen haben die Luft, die wir atmen, in den letzten zwei Jahrhunderten schnell verändert, indem sie CO2 hineingepumpt haben. In den letzten Jahren haben wir diese Gaswerte in unbekanntes Terrain getrieben. Diese Änderung hat unvermeidliche und beängstigende Folgen. Untersuchungen zeigen, dass ein erhöhter CO2-Gehalt, wenn er nicht kontrolliert wird, zu einem Anstieg der durch Umweltverschmutzung verursachten Todesfälle um Zehntausende führen und zu einer Verlangsamung der menschlichen Wahrnehmung führen könnte (insbesondere wenn man die Tatsache berücksichtigt, dass der CO2-Gehalt in Innenräumen in Städten tendenziell höher ist). . Kohlendioxid trägt auch zur Erwärmung bei, die zu einem Anstieg des Meeresspiegels, sengenden Hitzewellen und Superstürmen führt. „Als Wissenschaftlerin beunruhigt mich am meisten, was dieser anhaltende Anstieg tatsächlich bedeutet: dass wir mit voller Kraft mit einem beispiellosen Experiment mit unserem Planeten fortfahren, der einzigen Heimat, die wir haben“, sagte Katharine Hayhoe, eine Klimawissenschaftlerin, auf Twitter . Riesige Gletscher in der Westantarktis scheinen in einem unumkehrbaren Tauwetter gefangen zu sein, das mit der globalen Erwärmung verbunden ist und den Meeresspiegel für Jahrhunderte ansteigen lassen kann. NASA Die Luft einer neuen Welt atmen In den 800.000 Jahren, für die wir Aufzeichnungen haben, schwankte der durchschnittliche globale CO2-Gehalt zwischen etwa 170 ppm und 280 ppm. Als die Menschen im Industriezeitalter begannen, fossile Brennstoffe zu verbrennen, änderten sich die Dinge schnell. Erst im Industriezeitalter stieg die Zahl auf über 300 ppm. Die Konzentration stieg 2013 erstmals auf über 400 ppm und steigt weiter an. Unter Wissenschaftlern gibt es eine Debatte darüber, wann die CO2-Konzentration das letzte Mal so hoch war. Es könnte während des Pliozäns gewesen sein, vor 2 Millionen bis 4,6 Millionen Jahren, als der Meeresspiegel 60 bis 80 Fuß höher war als heute. Oder es war im Miozän vor 10 bis 14 Millionen Jahren, als die Meere mehr als 100 Fuß höher waren als heute. In unserer 800.000-jährigen Aufzeichnung dauerte es etwa 1.000 Jahre, bis der CO2-Gehalt um 35 ppm anstieg. Wir gehen derzeit von einem durchschnittlichen Anstieg von mehr als 2 ppm pro Jahr aus, was bedeutet, dass wir innerhalb der nächsten 45 Jahre einen Durchschnitt von 500 ppm erreichen könnten. CO2 schadet der menschlichen Gesundheit in diesen Konzentrationen nicht direkt. Aber weil es Wärme auf dem Planeten einfängt, die dann den globalen Thermostat aufdreht, kann es einen sehr erheblichen Einfluss auf die Gesundheit haben. Die globale Temperatur folgt sehr genau dem atmosphärischen CO2-Gehalt. Zu den potenziellen Auswirkungen höherer Durchschnittstemperaturen gehören Zehntausende von Todesfällen durch Hitzewellen, extremere Wetterereignisse und die Ausbreitung von Krankheiten, die von Zecken und Mücken übertragen werden – etwas, das wir bereits sehen. (Eine vollständige Liste möglicher Auswirkungen des Klimawandels auf die menschliche Gesundheit finden Sie auf einer archivierten Seite der Environmental Protection Agency.) Globale Jahrestemperatur und CO2-Werte, 1959 bis 2016 Höhere CO2-Werte und die dadurch verursachte Erwärmung verschlimmern auch die Ozonbelastung. Eine Studie aus dem Jahr 2008 ergab, dass für jedes Grad Celsius, das die Temperatur aufgrund des CO2-Gehalts erhöht, die Ozonverschmutzung voraussichtlich weitere 22.000 Menschen durch Atemwegserkrankungen, Asthma und Emphyseme töten wird. Menschen mussten noch nie so verschmutzte Luft atmen. Es hat sich gezeigt, dass eine erhöhte Luftverschmutzung Lungenkrebs, Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen und eine höhere Rate an Allergien und Asthma verursacht. Eine kürzlich durchgeführte Studie ergab, dass im Jahr 2015 9 Millionen Menschen vorzeitig an durch Umweltverschmutzung verursachten Krankheiten starben, was 16 % aller Todesfälle weltweit entspricht. Andere Untersuchungen haben noch mehr Bedenken aufgeworfen. Der durchschnittliche CO2-Gehalt repräsentiert nicht die Luft, die die meisten von uns atmen. Städte haben tendenziell weit mehr CO2 als der Durchschnitt – und diese Werte steigen in Innenräumen sogar noch höher. Einige Untersuchungen deuten darauf hin, dass es sich negativ auf die menschliche Wahrnehmung und Entscheidungsfindung auswirken kann. Aus diesen Gründen entschied die EPA von Präsident Barack Obama im Jahr 2009, dass CO2 ein Schadstoff ist, der unter dem Clean Air Act reguliert werden muss. Aber die Trump-Administration bewertet dieses Urteil neu. Fußgänger überqueren an einem smogigen Tag in Nanjing, China, eine Straße. Thomson Reuters Ertrinken in CO2 Die Auswirkungen des CO2-Anstiegs auf die menschliche Gesundheit sind hier nur ein Teil der größeren Geschichte. Die Veränderung, die wir in letzter Zeit beim CO2-Gehalt gesehen haben, war viel schneller als die historischen Trends. Einige Experten glauben, dass wir auf dem richtigen Weg sind, bis zum Ende des Jahrhunderts 550 ppm zu erreichen, was dazu führen könnte, dass die durchschnittliche globale Temperatur um 6 Grad Celsius ansteigt. Zum Kontext: Die Zunahme von Superstürmen, steigenden Meeresspiegeln und der Ausbreitung von durch Zecken übertragenen Krankheiten, die wir bereits sehen, kommt nach einem Anstieg von 0,9 Grad. Daten von Parrenin et al., 2013; Snyderet al., 2016; Bereiter et al., 2015. Ben Henley und Nerilie Abram/The Conversation Projektionen des Meeresspiegelanstiegs werden auch noch extremer, wenn die CO2-Werte weiter steigen. Im Moment steigen die Kohlendioxidemissionen immer noch. Das Ziel des Pariser Klimaschutzabkommens ist es, den globalen Temperaturanstieg auf 2 Grad Celsius oder weniger zu begrenzen. Aber wie ein neuer Artikel im Journal Nature enthüllte, sind wir auf dem Weg zu einer Erwärmung von mehr als 3 Grad. Die neuesten Messungen zeigen, dass wir sehr schnell drastische Änderungen vornehmen müssen, wenn wir dieses gefährliche Szenario vermeiden wollen. Diese Meldung wurde am 12. Juni aktualisiert, um die neu veröffentlichten Daten zu den CO2-Werten aufzunehmen, die im Mai einen neuen Rekord erreichten, und um die Mittel zu verdeutlichen, durch die höhere CO2-Werte die menschliche Gesundheit beeinträchtigen.

Roger Pielke Jr. ist Wissenschaftler an der University of Colorado in Boulder, der bis vor einigen Jahren weltweit führende Forschungen zu Klimawandel und Extremwetter betrieben hat. Er fand überzeugende Beweise dafür, dass der Klimawandel nicht zu höheren Raten wetterbedingter Schäden weltweit führt, wenn man die Zunahme von Bevölkerung und Wohlstand berücksichtigt. Er half auch bei der Einberufung wichtiger akademischer Gremien, um die Beweise zu sichten und den politischen Entscheidungsträgern den nahezu einstimmigen wissenschaftlichen Konsens zu diesem Thema zu vermitteln. Für seine Bemühungen wurde Pielke einer bösartigen, gut finanzierten Verleumdungskampagne ausgesetzt, die unter anderem vom Weißen Haus Obama und führenden demokratischen Kongressabgeordneten unterstützt wurde und 2015 in seiner Entscheidung gipfelte, das Feld zu verlassen.

Diese Anzeige wurde noch nicht geladen, aber Ihr Artikel wird unten fortgesetzt. Inhalt des Artikels Im Jahr 2012 erschien der IPCC-Sonderbericht zu Extremwetter und wiederholte den Hohenkammer-Konsens, der zu dem Schluss kam, dass es keinen statistischen Zusammenhang zwischen dem Klimawandel und Messungen wetterbedingter Schäden gibt, wenn man das Bevölkerungswachstum und die wirtschaftlichen Veränderungen berücksichtigt. 2013 sagte Pielke vor dem Kongress der Vereinigten Staaten aus und übermittelte die Ergebnisse des IPCC. Kurz darauf beschuldigte Obamas Wissenschaftsberater John Holdren ihn, den Kongress in die Irre geführt zu haben, und startete einen langwierigen, aber schlecht informierten Angriff auf Pielke, der die Demokraten im Kongress dazu veranlasste, eine Untersuchung zu Pielkes Finanzierungsquellen einzuleiten (die angesichts freundlicher Schlussfolgerungen schnell verpuffte). In der Zwischenzeit gelang es stark finanzierten linken Gruppen, ihn von einer beliebten Internet-Nachrichtenplattform zu feuern. 2015 verließ Pielke die Klimabranche. Wo ist die Wissenschaft also gelandet? In der zweiten Hälfte seines Vortrags überprüft Pielke die Wissenschaft, wie sie im neuesten (2013) IPCC Assessment Report, dem 2018 U.S. National Climate Assessment und den aktuellsten wissenschaftlichen Daten und Literatur zu finden ist. Es hat sich nichts Wesentliches geändert. Weltweit gibt es keine eindeutigen Hinweise auf Trends und Muster bei Extremereignissen wie Dürren, Wirbelstürmen und Überschwemmungen. Manche Regionen erleben mehr, manche weniger und manche keinen Trend. Datenbeschränkungen und Inkonsistenzen in Mustern verhindern auf die eine oder andere Weise zuversichtliche Behauptungen über globale Trends. Es gibt keinen Trend bei der Häufigkeit oder Intensität der Landung von US-Hurrikanen. Wenn überhaupt, waren die letzten 50 Jahre relativ ruhig. Es gibt keinen Trend zu Überschwemmungen im Zusammenhang mit Hurrikans in den USA. Es gibt auch keine Hinweise auf eine weltweite Zunahme von Überschwemmungen. Seit 1965 haben mehr Teile der USA einen Rückgang der Überschwemmungen als einen Anstieg erlebt. Und von 1940 bis heute sind die Hochwasserschäden als Prozentsatz des BIP von etwa 0,2 Prozent auf weniger als 0,05 Prozent pro Jahr gesunken. Die Werbegeschichte wird unten fortgesetzt. Diese Anzeige wurde noch nicht geladen, aber Ihr Artikel wird unten fortgesetzt. Artikelinhalt Und weiter geht's. Es gibt keinen Trend bei den Schäden durch Tornados in den USA (tatsächlich waren die Jahre 2012 bis 2017 unterdurchschnittlich). Es gibt keinen Trend bei globalen Dürren. Kälteeinbrüche in den USA sind zurückgegangen, aber unerwarteterweise auch Hitzewellen. Unter dem Strich gibt es trotz gegenteiliger Behauptungen von Trudeau keine solide Verbindung zwischen dem Klimawandel und vielen wichtigen Indikatoren für extremes Wetter, über die Politiker immer wieder sprechen, wie Hurrikane, Tornados, Dürren, Regenfälle und Überschwemmungen. Die ständige Behauptung solcher Links ist eine Fehlinformation, die für politische und rhetorische Zwecke verwendet wird. Mächtige Leute kommen damit durch, weil so wenige Leute wissen, was die Zahlen zeigen. Viele Wissenschaftler, die es besser wissen, schweigen. Und die wenigen, die sich gegen die Propaganda wehren, wie Roger Pielke Jr., finden sich auf der Empfängerseite von Beschimpfungen und karrieregefährdenden Angriffen wieder, obwohl sie alle Wissenschaft auf ihrer Seite haben. Etwas ist beängstigend und extrem geworden, aber es ist nicht das Wetter. • Ross McKitrick ist Wirtschaftsprofessor an der University of Guelph und Senior Fellow des Fraser Institute.

2bbc1c1a	Wissenschaftler sagen, dass sie Beweise dafür gefunden haben, dass gefrorene Methanablagerungen im Arktischen Ozean begonnen haben, über einem großen Bereich des Kontinentalhangs vor der ostsibirischen Küste freigesetzt zu werden, wie der Guardian enthüllen kann. In der Laptewsee in der Nähe von Russland wurden bis zu einer Tiefe von 350 Metern hohe Konzentrationen des starken Treibhausgases nachgewiesen, was bei Forschern zu Befürchtungen führte, dass die Entdeckung „ernsthafte Klimafolgen“ haben könnte. Die Hangsedimente in der Arktis enthalten riesige Mengen an gefrorenem Methan und anderen Gasen – sogenannten Hydraten. Methan hat über 20 Jahre eine 80-mal stärkere Erwärmungswirkung als Kohlendioxid. Der United States Geological Survey hat zuvor die Destabilisierung der arktischen Hydrate als eines der vier schwerwiegendsten Szenarien für einen abrupten Klimawandel aufgeführt. Das internationale Team an Bord des russischen Forschungsschiffs R/V Akademik Keldysh sagte, die meisten Blasen würden sich derzeit im Wasser auflösen, aber die Methanwerte an der Oberfläche seien vier- bis achtmal so hoch wie normalerweise zu erwarten, und dies entweiche in die Atmosphäre. „Im Moment ist es unwahrscheinlich, dass es größere Auswirkungen auf die globale Erwärmung geben wird, aber der Punkt ist, dass dieser Prozess jetzt ausgelöst wurde. Dieses Methanhydratsystem an den ostsibirischen Hängen wurde gestört und der Prozess wird noch andauern“, sagte der schwedische Wissenschaftler Örjan Gustafsson von der Universität Stockholm in einem Satellitenruf des Schiffes. Kurzanleitung Methan und die Arktis-Show Warum gelten Methanhydrate als „schlafende Riesen“ für das Klima? Wissenschaftler schätzen, dass 1.400 Gigatonnen Kohlenstoff in Unterwasserhydraten (gefrorenes Methan und andere Gase) unter dem arktischen submarinen Permafrost eingeschlossen sind, von denen einige anfällig für globale Erwärmung sein könnten. Wenn große Mengen freigesetzt würden, könnte dies das Klima schnell destabilisieren, denn Methan ist ein starkes Treibhausgas mit einer 80-mal stärkeren Erwärmungswirkung als Kohlendioxid über einen Zeitraum von 20 Jahren. Solche Bedenken veranlassten den United States Geological Survey, die Destabilisierung der arktischen Hydrate als eines der vier schwerwiegendsten Szenarien für einen abrupten Klimawandel aufzulisten. Diese Möglichkeit – manchmal als „Clathrat-Gun-Hypothese“ bezeichnet – war die Grundlage für Weltuntergangsszenarien einer galoppierenden Erwärmung, die die Erde in einen Treibhauszustand kippen lässt. Mehrere Studien deuten jedoch darauf hin, dass solche Befürchtungen übertrieben sind. Das klingt beängstigend. Wann könnte es passieren? Es gibt viele Ungewissheiten: Bei welcher Temperatur werden Hydrate destabilisiert und wenn ja, wie schnell wird dies geschehen? und werden die Gasblasen die Oberfläche erreichen und in die Atmosphäre freigesetzt werden oder sich einfach in den Ozeanen auflösen? Diese und andere Fragen sind nun Gegenstand intensiver Forschung am Schelf und an den Hängen der Laptewsee und anderen Gebieten der Arktis. Die Wissenschaftler – die Teil einer mehrjährigen International Shelf Study Expedition sind – betonten, dass ihre Ergebnisse vorläufig seien. Methanaustritte, die in der Vergangenheit entdeckt wurden, erwiesen sich als historisch, aber die Expedition glaubt, dass diese neu sind, basierend auf einer früheren Studie, die die Bewegung des Unterwasserpermafrosts zwischen den frühen 1980er Jahren und 2015 zeigt. Das Ausmaß der Methanfreisetzungen wird nicht bestätigt, bis sie zurückkehren, analysieren die Daten und veröffentlichen ihre Studien in einer Fachzeitschrift mit Peer-Review. Aber die Entdeckung von möglicherweise destabilisiertem gefrorenem Methan wirft Bedenken hinsichtlich der möglichen Auswirkungen auf die Geschwindigkeit der globalen Erwärmung auf. Die Arktis gilt als Ground Zero in der Debatte über die Anfälligkeit gefrorener Methanvorkommen – die als „schlafende Riesen des Kohlenstoffkreislaufs“ bezeichnet wurden – im Ozean, und wenn die Freisetzungen einen Wendepunkt überschreiten, könnte dies die Geschwindigkeit erhöhen globale Erwärmung. Da die arktische Temperatur jetzt mehr als doppelt so schnell ansteigt wie der globale Durchschnitt, war die Frage, wann – oder sogar ob – sie in die Atmosphäre freigesetzt werden, in Klimacomputermodellen mit erheblicher Unsicherheit verbunden. Das 60-köpfige Team der Akademik Keldysh glaubt, dass es das erste ist, das durch Beobachtungen bestätigt hat, dass die Methanfreisetzung bereits in einem weiten Bereich des Hangs etwa 600 km von der Küste entfernt ist. Wissenschaftler bei der Arbeit auf der Testfahrt Electra 1 vor der Akademik Keldysh-Expedition. Foto: ISSS2020 An sechs Beobachtungspunkten über einem Hangbereich von 150 km Länge und 10 km Breite sahen sie Wolken von aus Sedimenten freigesetzten Blasen. An einer Stelle am Hang der Laptewsee fanden sie in etwa 300 Metern Tiefe Methankonzentrationen von bis zu 1.600 Nanomol pro Liter, das ist 400 Mal höher als zu erwarten wäre, wenn Meer und Atmosphäre im Gleichgewicht wären. Igor Semiletov von der Russischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, der Chefwissenschaftler an Bord, sagte, die Entladungen seien „deutlich größer“ als alles, was zuvor gefunden wurde. „Die Entdeckung der aktiven Freisetzung von Schelfhanghydraten ist sehr wichtig und bisher unbekannt“, sagte er. „Das ist eine neue Seite. Möglicherweise können sie schwerwiegende Folgen für das Klima haben, aber wir brauchen weitere Studien, bevor wir das bestätigen können.“ Die wahrscheinlichste Ursache für die Instabilität ist das Eindringen warmer Atlantikströmungen in die östliche Arktis. Diese „Atlantisierung“ wird durch vom Menschen verursachte Klimastörungen vorangetrieben. Die neueste Entdeckung markiert möglicherweise die dritte Quelle von Methanemissionen aus der Region. Semiletov, der dieses Gebiet seit zwei Jahrzehnten untersucht, hat zuvor berichtet, dass das Gas aus dem Schelf der Arktis freigesetzt wird – dem größten aller Meere. Im zweiten Jahr in Folge hat sein Team kraterartige Pockennarben in den flacheren Teilen der Laptewsee und der Ostsibirischen See gefunden, die Methanblasen ausstoßen, die die Meeresoberfläche in Zehn- bis Hundertfach höheren Niveaus erreichen als normal. Dies ähnelt den Kratern und Dolinen, die Anfang dieses Herbstes aus der sibirischen Binnentundra gemeldet wurden. Die Temperaturen in Sibirien waren von Januar bis Juni dieses Jahres um 5 °C höher als der Durchschnitt, eine Anomalie, die durch vom Menschen verursachte Kohlendioxid- und Methanemissionen mindestens 600-mal wahrscheinlicher wurde. Das Meereis des vergangenen Winters schmolz ungewöhnlich früh. Der Frost dieses Winters hat noch nicht begonnen, bereits ein späterer Beginn als je zuvor.	Arktische Methanvorkommen „beginnen sich freizusetzen“, sagen Wissenschaftler	partially false
23ff9e71	Die Vermeidung von Fleisch- und Milchprodukten ist laut den Wissenschaftlern hinter der bisher umfassendsten Analyse der Schäden, die die Landwirtschaft dem Planeten zufügt, der größte Einzelweg, um die Auswirkungen auf die Umwelt zu verringern. Die neue Studie zeigt, dass ohne Fleisch- und Milchkonsum die weltweite Nutzung von Ackerland um mehr als 75 % reduziert werden könnte – eine Fläche, die der der USA, Chinas, der Europäischen Union und Australiens zusammen entspricht – und immer noch die Welt ernähren könnte. Der Verlust von Wildgebieten an die Landwirtschaft ist die Hauptursache für das derzeitige Massensterben von Wildtieren. Die neue Analyse zeigt, dass Fleisch und Milchprodukte zwar nur 18 % der Kalorien und 37 % des Proteins liefern, aber die überwiegende Mehrheit – 83 % – des Ackerlandes beanspruchen und 60 % der Treibhausgasemissionen der Landwirtschaft produzieren. Andere neuere Forschungen zeigen, dass 86 % aller Landsäugetiere heute Nutztiere oder Menschen sind. Die Wissenschaftler fanden auch heraus, dass selbst Fleisch- und Milchprodukte mit den geringsten Auswirkungen immer noch viel mehr Umweltschäden verursachen als der am wenigsten nachhaltige Gemüse- und Getreideanbau. Die in der Zeitschrift Science veröffentlichte Studie erstellte einen riesigen Datensatz, der auf fast 40.000 landwirtschaftlichen Betrieben in 119 Ländern basiert und 40 Lebensmittelprodukte abdeckt, die 90 % dessen ausmachen, was gegessen wird. Es bewertete die gesamten Auswirkungen dieser Lebensmittel vom Erzeuger bis zum Verbraucher auf Landnutzung, klimabedingte Emissionen, Süßwassernutzung und Wasserverschmutzung (Eutrophierung) und Luftverschmutzung (Versauerung). „Eine vegane Ernährung ist wahrscheinlich der beste Weg, um die Auswirkungen auf den Planeten Erde zu reduzieren, nicht nur durch Treibhausgase, sondern auch durch globale Versauerung, Eutrophierung, Land- und Wassernutzung“, sagte Joseph Poore von der Universität Oxford, Großbritannien, der die Initiative leitete die Forschung. „Es ist weitaus größer als die Reduzierung Ihrer Flüge oder der Kauf eines Elektroautos“, sagte er, da diese nur die Treibhausgasemissionen senken. „Die Landwirtschaft ist ein Sektor, der die ganze Vielzahl von Umweltproblemen umfasst“, sagte er. „Wirklich, es sind tierische Produkte, die für so viel davon verantwortlich sind. Der Verzicht auf tierische Produkte bringt weitaus bessere Umweltvorteile als der Versuch, nachhaltiges Fleisch und Milchprodukte zu kaufen.“ Die Analyse ergab auch eine große Variabilität zwischen verschiedenen Arten der Herstellung derselben Lebensmittel. Zum Beispiel verursachen Rinder, die auf abgeholztem Land gehalten werden, 12-mal mehr Treibhausgase und verbrauchen 50-mal mehr Land als Rinder, die reiches natürliches Weideland beweiden. Aber der Vergleich von Rindfleisch mit Pflanzeneiweiß wie Erbsen ist krass, denn selbst das Rindfleisch mit der geringsten Umweltbelastung ist für sechsmal mehr Treibhausgase und 36-mal mehr Land verantwortlich. Die große Variabilität der Umweltauswirkungen verschiedener Farmen biete eine Möglichkeit, den Schaden zu verringern, sagte Poore, ohne dass die Weltbevölkerung vegan werden müsste. Wenn die schädlichste Hälfte der Fleisch- und Milchproduktion durch pflanzliche Lebensmittel ersetzt würde, bringt dies immer noch etwa zwei Drittel der Vorteile, wenn man auf die gesamte Fleisch- und Milchproduktion verzichtet. Die Verringerung der Umweltauswirkungen der Landwirtschaft ist nicht einfach, warnte Poore: „Es gibt über 570 Millionen landwirtschaftliche Betriebe, die alle etwas unterschiedliche Wege benötigen, um ihre Auswirkungen zu verringern. Es ist eine [ökologische] Herausforderung wie kein anderer Wirtschaftssektor.“ Aber er sagte, dass jedes Jahr mindestens 500 Milliarden Dollar für Agrarsubventionen ausgegeben werden und wahrscheinlich noch viel mehr: „Da ist eine Menge Geld da, um etwas wirklich Gutes zu tun.“ Etiketten, die die Auswirkungen von Produkten aufzeigen, wären ein guter Anfang, damit die Verbraucher die am wenigsten schädlichen Optionen wählen könnten, sagte er, aber Subventionen für nachhaltige und gesunde Lebensmittel und Steuern auf Fleisch und Milchprodukte werden wahrscheinlich auch notwendig sein. Eine Überraschung der Arbeit war der große Einfluss der Süßwasserfischzucht, die zwei Drittel dieser Fische in Asien und 96 % in Europa liefert und als relativ umweltfreundlich galt. „Sie bringen all diese Fische, die Exkremente und unverbrauchtes Futter auf den Grund des Teichs ablagern, wo es kaum Sauerstoff gibt, was es zur perfekten Umgebung für die Methanproduktion macht“, ein starkes Treibhausgas, sagte Poore. Die Forschung ergab auch, dass grasgefüttertes Rindfleisch, von dem angenommen wird, dass es relativ geringe Auswirkungen hat, immer noch für viel höhere Auswirkungen verantwortlich ist als pflanzliche Lebensmittel. „Die Umwandlung von Gras in [Fleisch] ist wie die Umwandlung von Kohle in Energie. Es ist mit immensen Emissionskosten verbunden“, sagte Poore. Die neue Forschung wurde von anderen Lebensmittelexperten stark gelobt. Prof. Gidon Eshel vom Bard College, USA, sagte: „Ich war überwältigt. Es ist wirklich wichtig, solide, ehrgeizig, aufschlussreich und wunderschön gemacht.“ Er sagte, frühere Arbeiten zur Quantifizierung der Auswirkungen der Landwirtschaft, einschließlich seiner eigenen, hätten einen Top-Down-Ansatz unter Verwendung von Daten auf nationaler Ebene gewählt, aber die neue Arbeit verwende einen Bottom-Up-Ansatz mit Daten von Betrieb zu Betrieb. „Es ist sehr beruhigend zu sehen, dass sie im Wesentlichen die gleichen Ergebnisse liefern. Aber das neue Werk hat sehr viele wichtige Details, die zutiefst aufschlussreich sind.“ Prof. Tim Benton von der University of Leeds, UK, sagte: „Dies ist eine immens nützliche Studie. Es bringt eine riesige Menge an Daten zusammen und das macht seine Schlussfolgerungen viel robuster. Die Art und Weise, wie wir Lebensmittel produzieren, konsumieren und verschwenden, ist aus planetarischer Sicht nicht nachhaltig. Angesichts der globalen Fettleibigkeitskrise hat eine Ernährungsumstellung – weniger tierische Produkte und mehr Gemüse und Obst – das Potenzial, sowohl uns als auch den Planeten gesünder zu machen.“ Dr. Peter Alexander von der University of Edinburgh, UK, war ebenfalls beeindruckt, merkte aber an: „Nachhaltig bewirtschaftete Weiden können Vorteile für die Umwelt haben, z. B. für die Biodiversität, und der zunehmende Konsum tierischer Produkte kann die Ernährung einiger der Ärmsten weltweit verbessern. Meine persönliche Meinung ist, dass wir diese Ergebnisse nicht als Notwendigkeit interpretieren sollten, über Nacht vegan zu werden, sondern unseren [Fleisch-]Konsum zu mäßigen.“ Poore sagte: „Der Grund, warum ich dieses Projekt gestartet habe, war, zu verstehen, ob es nachhaltige Tierproduzenten gibt. Aber ich habe in den letzten vier Jahren dieses Projekts aufgehört, tierische Produkte zu konsumieren. Diese Auswirkungen sind nicht notwendig, um unsere derzeitige Lebensweise aufrechtzuerhalten. Die Frage ist, um wie viel wir sie reduzieren können, und die Antwort ist viel.“	Die Vermeidung von Fleisch und Milchprodukten ist der „größte Weg“, um Ihre Auswirkungen auf die Erde zu verringern	partially false
fb4fbda8	Ted Cruz vertritt Texas im Senat der Vereinigten Staaten. Die in diesem Kommentar geäußerten Ansichten sind seine eigenen. (CNN) Nach einer erfolgreichen internationalen Tournee und dem G-7-Gipfel in Italien hat Präsident Trump die Gelegenheit, unsere Nation von den unfairen und wirtschaftlich verheerenden Anforderungen des Pariser Abkommens zu entlasten, des Klimaabkommens der Vereinten Nationen, das er während des Pariser Abkommens zerreißen wollte Kampagne. Und so bald wie möglich sollte Präsident Trump sein Wahlversprechen einlösen – und einlösen. Das Abkommen, das letztes Jahr von der Obama-Regierung unterzeichnet wurde, würde die Vereinigten Staaten dazu verpflichten, ihre CO2-Emissionen drastisch zu reduzieren, während es einigen Ländern ermöglicht wird, ihre eigenen zu erhöhen. All dies, während nichts dazu beiträgt, die globalen Temperaturen sinnvoll zu senken. Laut einer aktuellen Studie von National Economic Research Associates Economic Consulting könnte das Pariser Abkommen bis 2040 3 Billionen US-Dollar BIP, 6,5 Millionen Arbeitsplätze im Industriesektor und 7.000 US-Dollar an Haushaltseinkommen pro Kopf der amerikanischen Wirtschaft zunichte machen 250 Milliarden Dollar von unserem BIP und 2,7 Millionen Arbeitsplätze abbauen. Die Zement-, Eisen- und Stahl- sowie die Erdölraffinerieindustrie könnten ihre Produktion um 21 %, 19 % bzw. 11 % senken. Diese unfairen Standards würden nicht nur das Beschäftigungswachstum und die Löhne in Amerika verringern und die monatlichen Betriebskosten für hart arbeitende Familien erhöhen, sie würden die Vereinigten Staaten in der Weltwirtschaft grundlegend benachteiligen. Die Folge: Unsere Wirtschaftsleistung würde hinterherhinken, während andere Länder ihr Bruttoinlandsprodukt weiter ausbauten. Die Befürworter des Abkommens vermarkten es als Allheilmittel, um die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels anzugehen, aber im Kern geht es darum, die staatliche Kontrolle zu erhöhen – über die Wirtschaft, den Energiesektor und fast jeden Aspekt unseres täglichen Lebens. Es stellt genau den fehlgeleiteten, von oben nach unten gerichteten Ansatz dar, den die Regierung weiß, was am besten ist und den die amerikanischen Wähler 2016 entschieden abgelehnt haben. Wir können keinen Weg einschlagen, der die amerikanischen Arbeitnehmer an die erste Stelle setzt, wenn wir einen Energiesektor für fossile Brennstoffe lahmlegen, der 82 % der verbrauchten Energie erzeugt in den Vereinigten Staaten. Allein die Kohleindustrie liefert fast ein Drittel des amerikanischen Stroms – wobei immer mehr saubere Technologien zur Kohleverbrennung verfügbar werden. Amerika ist bereit, im nächsten Jahrzehnt zum Nettoenergieexporteur zu werden. Wir sollten diesen Fortschritt nicht auf Kosten einer Schwächung unserer Energie-Renaissance und einer Hemmung des Wirtschaftswachstums aufgeben. Und vergessen wir nicht die massiven Stromkostenerhöhungen, die das Abkommen mit sich bringen würde. Der Clean Power Plan, ein wichtiger Bestandteil der Erfüllung der Vereinbarung, würde die Energiekosten für arbeitende und mittelständische Texaner bis 2030 um 16 % in die Höhe treiben, so das Economic Reliability Council of Texas, das Unternehmen, das das Stromnetz für einen Großteil unseres Landes betreibt Zustand. Wir können uns einfach kein Abkommen leisten, das Tausende von Amerikanern arbeitslos macht, ihre Energiekosten erhöht und unsere Kernindustrien zerstört. Als Gegenleistung für die Lähmung unserer Wirtschaft würde das Pariser Abkommen so gut wie nichts tun, um die globalen Temperaturen zu beeinflussen. Nach den eigenen Modellen der EPA würden die globalen Temperaturen nur um weniger als zwei Zehntel Grad Celsius sinken, wenn alle Kohlenstoffemissionen in Amerika im Wesentlichen eliminiert würden. Während das Abkommen einen vernachlässigbaren Einfluss auf die Temperaturen hätte, würde sich Amerika einen Wettbewerbsnachteil verschaffen. Denn während die Obama-Regierung Amerika verantwortungslos zu sofortigen, echten Emissionssenkungen verpflichtet hat, hätten unsere globalen wirtschaftlichen Konkurrenten kein solches Handicap. Tatsächlich darf Russland seine Emissionen um etwa 50 % erhöhen, und China und Indien haben bis 2030 keine sinnvolle Obergrenze für Emissionen. Diese Diskrepanz zwischen den Zusagen der Länder fügt unserer Wirtschaft jetzt echte Verluste zu, während unsere Rivalen weiter wachsen, sich industrialisieren und diversifizieren in ihrem eigenen Tempo ohne Implementierungskosten. In der Zwischenzeit würde das Abkommen die amerikanischen Steuerzahler zwingen, alternative Energien auf Kosten von sauberer Kohle, Atomkraft und Erdgas zu subventionieren – Energieressourcen, die tatsächlich für unsere Wirtschaft und unsere Umwelt funktionieren. Das Pariser Abkommen würde Amerika auch im globalen Wettlauf um neue Energiequellen behindern. Russland hat der Arktis finanzielle und militärische Mittel zugeteilt, um seinen Anspruch auf die riesigen Tiefsee-Mineral-, Öl- und Gasvorkommen der Region abzustecken. China erkundet und handelt auch mit arktischem Öl und Gas. Währenddessen kämpft amerikanisches Flüssigerdgas mit Logistikkosten, die seine Wettbewerbsfähigkeit schwächen. Indem es unseren Rivalen erlaubt, ihre Zusammenarbeit und ihren strategischen Einfluss auf der ganzen Welt zu verstärken – Druck auf unsere Verbündeten und Partner auszuüben, heimische Stellen zu schädigen und dabei unser Ansehen und unseren Einfluss erheblich zu verringern – würde das Abkommen Amerikas nationaler Sicherheit genauso schaden wie unserer wirtschaftliche Sicherheit. Die Emissionssenkungen, die die USA heute vornehmen müssten, und die daraus resultierenden Kosten für unsere eigenen Energieunternehmen würden unsere Fähigkeit schwächen, unsere Konkurrenten im Streben nach ungenutzten Energiequellen auf Augenhöhe zu bekämpfen.

Solange sich die USA nicht vollständig zurückziehen, wird das Pariser Abkommen unserer Sicherheit und Wirtschaft weiterhin nachhaltig schaden, und es hält die Tür für künftige Regierungen offen, es als Mittel zu nutzen, um kostspieligere und ineffizientere Energievorschriften durchzusetzen. Wir sollten ein Abkommen, das den Launen zukünftiger Regierungen oder Kongresse unterliegt, nicht wie eine nasse Decke über unsere Wirtschaft hängen lassen – die Energiepreise in die Höhe treiben, unsere industrielle Basis verwüsten und unsere Rivalen stärken. Ich hoffe, dass Präsident Trump die Gelegenheit nutzen wird, um die von ihm eingegangene Verpflichtung zu erfüllen und Amerika aus dem Pariser Abkommen zurückzuziehen.

caa34051	Eine dominoartige Kaskade aus schmelzendem Eis, sich erwärmenden Meeren, wechselnden Strömungen und sterbenden Wäldern könnte die Erde in einen „Treibhaus“-Zustand kippen, jenseits dessen menschliche Bemühungen zur Reduzierung von Emissionen zunehmend vergeblich sein werden, warnte eine Gruppe führender Klimawissenschaftler. Diese düstere Aussicht wird in einem Zeitschriftenartikel skizziert, der die kombinierten Folgen von 10 Klimawandelprozessen betrachtet, darunter die Freisetzung von Methan, das im sibirischen Permafrost eingeschlossen ist, und die Auswirkungen des schmelzenden Eises in Grönland auf die Antarktis. Die Autoren des Essays, der in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences veröffentlicht wurde, betonen, dass ihre Analyse nicht schlüssig ist, warnen jedoch davor, dass die Verpflichtung von Paris, die Erwärmung auf 2°C über dem vorindustriellen Niveau zu halten, möglicherweise nicht ausreicht, um das Klima des Planeten zu „parken“. eine stabile Temperatur. Sie warnen davor, dass die Treibhausbahn „mit ziemlicher Sicherheit Deltaumgebungen überfluten, das Risiko von Schäden durch Küstenstürme erhöhen und Korallenriffe (und alle Vorteile, die sie für die Gesellschaft bieten) bis zum Ende dieses Jahrhunderts oder früher zerstören würde“. Vor 50 Jahren wurde dies als Alarmismus abgetan, aber jetzt sind Wissenschaftler wirklich besorgt. “, sagte Johan Rockström, Geschäftsführer des Stockholm Resilience Centre. „Wir müssen es jetzt wissen. Es ist so dringend. Das ist eine der existentiellsten Fragen der Wissenschaft.“ Rockström und seine Co-Autoren gehören zu den weltweit führenden Autoritäten für positive Rückkopplungsschleifen, durch die steigende Temperaturen neue Quellen von Treibhausgasen freisetzen oder die Fähigkeit der Erde zerstören, Kohlenstoff zu absorbieren oder Wärme zu reflektieren. Ihr neues Papier fragt, ob sich die Temperatur des Planeten bei 2 ° C stabilisieren kann oder ob er zu einem extremeren Zustand tendieren wird. Die Autoren versuchen abzuschätzen, ob die Erwärmung gestoppt werden kann oder ob sie in Richtung einer „Treibhaus“-Welt kippen wird, die 4°C wärmer ist als vorindustrielle Zeiten und das menschliche Leben weit weniger unterstützt. Katherine Richardson von der Universität Kopenhagen, eine der Autoren, sagte, das Papier zeige, dass es beim Klimaschutz nicht nur darum gehe, den Knopf für Emissionen zu drehen, sondern zu verstehen, wie verschiedene Faktoren auf globaler Ebene zusammenwirken. „Wir stellen fest, dass die Erde in ihrer Geschichte noch nie einen quasi stabilen Zustand hatte, der etwa 2 °C wärmer war als vorindustriell, und weisen darauf hin, dass ein erhebliches Risiko besteht, dass das System selbst aufgrund all dessen weiter wärmer werden ‚wollen‘ andere Prozesse – auch wenn wir die Emissionen stoppen“, sagte sie. „Dazu gehört nicht nur die Reduzierung von Emissionen, sondern noch viel mehr.“ Es werden immer noch neue Rückkopplungsschleifen entdeckt. Ein separates Papier, das in PNAS veröffentlicht wurde, zeigt, dass vermehrte Niederschläge – ein Symptom des Klimawandels in einigen Regionen – es den Waldböden erschweren, Treibhausgase wie Methan einzufangen. Frühere Studien haben gezeigt, dass die Schwächung der Kohlenstoffsenken 0,25 °C, das Waldsterben 0,11 °C, das Auftauen des Permafrostbodens 0,9 °C und die erhöhte Bakterienatmung 0,02 °C hinzufügen. Die Autoren des neuen Papiers betrachten auch den Verlust von Methanhydraten aus dem Meeresboden und die Verringerung der Schnee- und Eisbedeckung an den Polen. Rockström sagt, dass es große Lücken in Daten und Wissen darüber gibt, wie ein Prozess einen anderen verstärken könnte. Im Gegensatz zur Gaia-Theorie, die darauf hindeutet, dass die Erde eine Tendenz zur Selbstaufrichtung hat, sagt er, dass die Rückkopplungen den Planeten in einen extremeren Zustand treiben könnten. Als Beispiel sagen die Autoren, dass der Verlust von grönländischem Eis die Meeresströmung des Golfstroms stören könnte, was den Meeresspiegel erhöhen und Wärme im Südpolarmeer ansammeln würde, was wiederum den Eisverlust aus der Ostantarktis beschleunigen würde. Die Besorgnis über diese Möglichkeit wurde Anfang dieses Jahres durch Berichte verstärkt, dass der Golfstrom auf seinem schwächsten Stand seit 1.600 Jahren war. Derzeit liegen die globalen Durchschnittstemperaturen knapp über 1°C über dem vorindustriellen Niveau und steigen um 0,17°C pro Jahrzehnt. Das Pariser Klimaabkommen sieht Maßnahmen vor, um die Erwärmung bis Ende des Jahrhunderts auf 1,5 bis 2 °C zu begrenzen, aber die Autoren warnen davor, dass drastischere Maßnahmen erforderlich sein könnten. „Die Hitzewelle, die wir jetzt in Europa haben, war nicht etwas, das mit einer Erwärmung von nur 1 °C erwartet wurde“, sagte Rockström. „Einige positive Rückkopplungsschleifen sind bereits in Betrieb, aber sie sind noch schwach. Wir brauchen Studien, um zu zeigen, wann sie einen außer Kontrolle geratenen Effekt verursachen könnten. Ein anderer Klimawissenschaftler – der nicht an dem Papier beteiligt war – betonte, das Dokument ziele eher darauf ab, Fragen aufzuwerfen als eine Theorie zu beweisen. „Es ist ziemlich selektiv, aber nicht ausgefallen“, sagte Prof. Martin Siegert, Co-Direktor des Grantham Institute. „Schwellen- und Kipppunkte wurden bereits diskutiert, aber zu sagen, dass 2C eine Schwelle ist, von der wir uns nicht zurückziehen können, ist meiner Meinung nach neu. Ich bin mir nicht sicher, welche ‚Beweise‘ es dafür gibt – oder ob es überhaupt welche geben kann, bis wir es erfahren.“ Rockström sagte, die Frage müsse gestellt werden. „Wir könnten am Ende das Pariser Abkommen einhalten und eine Erwärmung von 2°C einhalten, aber dann eine hässliche Überraschung erleben, wenn das System zu entgleiten beginnt“, sagte er. „Wir sagen nicht, dass dies definitiv passieren wird. Wir listen einfach alle störenden Ereignisse auf und schlagen plausible Begebenheiten vor … Vor 50 Jahren hätte man das noch als Panikmache abgetan, aber jetzt machen sich die Wissenschaftler große Sorgen.“ „Im Kontext des Sommers 2018 ist dies definitiv kein Fall von weinendem Wolf, der einen Fehlalarm auslöst: Die Wölfe sind jetzt in Sicht“, sagte Dr. Phil Williamson, Klimaforscher an der University of East Anglia. „Die Autoren argumentieren, dass wir in dieser Hinsicht viel proaktiver sein müssen, indem wir nicht nur die Treibhausgasemissionen so schnell wie möglich beenden, sondern auch die Widerstandsfähigkeit im Zusammenhang mit komplexen Erdsystemprozessen stärken, die wir möglicherweise erst vollständig verstehen, wenn es zu spät ist .“	Der Dominoeffekt von Klimaereignissen könnte die Erde in einen „Treibhaus“-Zustand versetzen	partially false
e122d505	Extrem heiße Tage, wenn die Temperaturen auf 95 Grad Fahrenheit oder höher steigen, können miserabel sein. Die Ernte verwelkt auf den Feldern. Stromnetze müssen mit der Nachfrage Schritt halten. Menschen sind einem höheren Sterberisiko ausgesetzt. Und diese heißen Temperaturen werden voraussichtlich in den kommenden Jahrzehnten viel häufiger auftreten. Globale Erwärmung unter Pariser Zusagen Globale Erwärmung unter Pariser Zusagen Tage pro Jahr über 35 °C 5 50 100 200 Die obige Karte, die auf einer neuen Analyse des Climate Impact Lab basiert, zeigt, wie 95-Grad-Tage (35 Grad Celsius) erwartet werden sich in diesem Jahrhundert vervielfachen, wenn Länder moderate Klimaschutzmaßnahmen ergreifen. In diesem Szenario würden die Länder einige Maßnahmen ergreifen, aber keine drastischen, um die Emissionen einzudämmen – ungefähr der Verlauf der derzeitigen Zusagen im Rahmen des Pariser Klimaabkommens. Die daraus resultierende Erderwärmung würde für viele Städte noch erhebliche Verschiebungen bewirken. In Washington herrschten von 1986 bis 2005 an durchschnittlich sieben Tagen im Jahr Temperaturen von mindestens 95 Grad. Bis zum Ende des Jahrhunderts kann die Stadt im Durchschnitt mit 29 dieser extrem heißen Tage pro Jahr rechnen. (Der wahrscheinliche Bereich liegt zwischen 14 und 46 heißen Tagen pro Jahr.) Phoenix ist an die Hitze gewöhnt und hat durchschnittlich 124 Tage pro Jahr mit 95-Grad-Wetter. Bis zum Ende des Jahrhunderts wird dies voraussichtlich auf etwa 155 Tage ansteigen – ein zusätzlicher Monat mit extremen Temperaturen pro Jahr. Madrid würde von acht extrem heißen Tagen pro Jahr auf 43 sinken, Peking von neun auf 35. Näher am Äquator sind die Schwankungen sogar noch größer. Neu-Delhi, Indiens Hauptstadt, hat historisch durchschnittlich 105 Tage mit Temperaturen von mindestens 95 Grad pro Jahr. Das wird wahrscheinlich auf einen Bereich von 137 bis 200 Tagen pro Jahr steigen. Die Dinge könnten schlimmer werden, wenn die Länder nicht handeln. Wenn die Nationen der Welt nichts gegen die globale Erwärmung unternehmen und die Emissionen weiterhin im gleichen Tempo steigen wie im ersten Jahrzehnt dieses Jahrhunderts – mit einer globalen Gesamterwärmung von 7,2 Grad Fahrenheit oder mehr bis zum Ende des Jahrhunderts würden extrem heiße Tage viel häufiger werden. Globale Erwärmung, wenn keine Maßnahmen ergriffen werden Globale Erwärmung, wenn keine Maßnahmen ergriffen werden Tage pro Jahr über 35 °C 5 50 100 200 Bis zum Jahr 2100 könnte Washington für ein ganzes Fünftel des Jahres bei 95-Grad-Wetter schwelen – ungefähr 74 Tage lang Durchschnitt. Große Teile Brasiliens und Subsahara-Afrikas würden diese Temperaturen fast das ganze Jahr über erleben. Dieser schlimmste Fall für die globale Erwärmung erscheint jetzt weniger wahrscheinlich, da der weltweite Kohleverbrauch zurückgeht und die Nationen langsam zu sauberer Energie übergehen. Wie 95-Grad-Tage unseren Alltag stören In den Vereinigten Staaten steigt der Stromverbrauch, wenn die Temperaturen steigen und immer mehr Haushalte häufiger Klimaanlagen verwenden. Eine kürzlich durchgeführte Studie ergab, dass das Stromnetz der Vereinigten Staaten in diesem Jahrhundert bei einem moderaten Erwärmungsszenario einen Anstieg der Spitzennachfrage um 7,2 Prozent bewältigen müsste.

In Ländern ohne weit verbreitete Abkühlung steigen die Hitzetoten an den heißesten Tagen stärker an. Eine Studie schätzt, dass Hitzetote in Indien um 3,2 Prozent pro 1,8 Grad Fahrenheit über 68 (oder pro 1 Grad Celsius über 20) zunehmen. Der Energieverbrauch in vielen Ländern kann stark ansteigen, da die Menschen Schwierigkeiten haben, sich an ein heißeres Klima anzupassen. Andere Wissenschaftler haben herausgefunden, dass die Mais- und Sojabohnenerträge in den Vereinigten Staaten steil abfallen, wenn die Temperaturen über 84 Grad Fahrenheit (29 Grad Celsius) steigen, und dass die Produktivität der Arbeiter stark abnimmt, insbesondere bei Arbeiten im Freien. Und Forscher versuchen zu verstehen, wie Kriminalität und Konflikte mit steigenden Temperaturen zunehmen könnten. Letztendlich werden sich die Menschen besser anpassen können, wenn sie eine bessere Vorstellung davon haben, was einzelne Städte und Regionen erwarten können, sagte Trevor Houser, der das Climate Impact Lab mitleitet. In den Vereinigten Staaten experimentieren einige Stadtplaner bereits mit Techniken wie dem Hinzufügen von Grünflächen oder der Erhöhung des Reflexionsvermögens von Dächern, um die Stadtzentren während Hitzewellen abzukühlen. „Im Moment, wenn Sie anfangen, mit Leuten über höhere Temperaturen zu sprechen, neigen sie dazu, zu denken, großartig, mehr Strandtage“, sagte Solomon Hsiang, Professor für öffentliche Ordnung an der University of California in Berkeley, der das Labor leitet. „Was oft weniger geschätzt wird, ist, wie sehr ein extrem heißer Tag unser Leben auf alle möglichen Arten verzerren kann, an die wir oft nicht einmal denken.“	95-Grad-Tage: Wie sich extreme Hitze auf der ganzen Welt ausbreiten könnte	true
4ebbbb28	Skeptiker der globalen Erwärmung sagen manchmal, dass steigende Temperaturen nur eine weitere natürlich auftretende Veränderung des Erdklimas sind, wie die mittelalterliche Warmzeit der Jahre 800 bis 1200 oder die Kleine Eiszeit, eine Periode der Abkühlung, die sich von etwa 1300 bis 1850 erstreckte Die am Mittwoch veröffentlichten Studien liefern deutliche Beweise dafür, dass der Anstieg der globalen Temperaturen in den letzten 150 Jahren weitaus schneller und umfassender war als jede Erwärmungsperiode in den letzten 2.000 Jahren – ein Ergebnis, das Behauptungen widerlegt, dass die heutige globale Erwärmung nicht unbedingt das Ergebnis von ist Menschliche Aktivität. „Die bekannte Maxime, dass sich das Klima ständig ändert, ist sicherlich wahr“, sagte Scott St. George, ein physischer Geograph an der Universität von Minnesota in Minneapolis, in einem schriftlichen Kommentar zu den Studien. „Aber selbst wenn wir unsere Perspektive auf die frühesten Tage des Römischen Reiches richten, können wir kein Ereignis erkennen, das auch nur im Entferntesten – weder im Ausmaß noch im Ausmaß – der Erwärmung der letzten Jahrzehnte entspricht.“ Seit Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts ist die globale Durchschnittstemperatur auf der Erde um etwa 2 Grad Fahrenheit gestiegen. Ein Konsens der Klimawissenschaftler führt den Anstieg hauptsächlich auf die Verbrennung fossiler Brennstoffe zurück, die Kohlendioxid und andere wärmespeichernde Treibhausgase in die Luft ausstoßen. Ohne konzertierte Bemühungen zur Reduzierung der Treibhausgasemissionen könnte die globale Durchschnittstemperatur bis 2100 um weitere 5,4 bis 9 Grad Fahrenheit steigen, sagen die Vereinten Nationen. Eine der in der Zeitschrift Nature veröffentlichten Studien zeigt, dass die Kleine Eiszeit und andere natürliche Schwankungen betrafen jeweils nur begrenzte Regionen des Planeten, was die moderne Erwärmung zur ersten und einzigen planetenweiten Erwärmungsperiode in den letzten zwei Jahrtausenden machte. Die andere Studie, die in Nature Geoscience veröffentlicht wurde, zeigt, dass die Geschwindigkeit der modernen Erwärmung die Veränderungen vor dem Beginn des Industriezeitalters bei weitem übertroffen hat. Für die Forschung analysierte ein Team unter der Leitung von Raphael Neukom, Postdoktorand am Institut für Geographie der Universität Bern in der Schweiz, Klimadaten aus 2000 Jahren. In Ermangelung direkter Temperaturinformationen – Thermometermessungen gab es vor Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts kaum – untersuchten die Wissenschaftler Daten von Jahresringen alter Bäume, Gletschereisschichten und Korallenresten, deren Schichten je nach chemischer Zusammensetzung unterschiedlich sind die Temperatur des Meerwassers. Die Nature-Studie kartierte die Temperaturschwankungen auf dem ganzen Planeten und stellte beispielsweise fest, dass die Kleine Eiszeit nicht die ganze Welt auf einmal betraf. Die Temperaturen im Pazifischen Ozean erreichten um 1500 ihren Tiefpunkt, fanden die Wissenschaftler heraus; Europa und Nordamerika haben sich für weitere zwei Jahrhunderte nicht vollständig entspannt. Dasselbe Muster wurde für die höheren Temperaturen während der mittelalterlichen Warmzeit beobachtet. Die Forscher fanden heraus, dass weniger als die Hälfte des Planeten die Hitze auf einmal spürte. Die Forschung zeigt, dass während der aktuellen Erwärmungsphase mehr als 98 Prozent der Erdoberfläche Rekordtemperaturen erlebt haben. Der Befund zeigt, wie dramatisch sich der heutige globale Temperaturanstieg von früheren Perioden der Temperaturänderung unterscheidet, sagten die Wissenschaftler. „Was wir zeigen, ist, dass diese Perioden nicht wie bisher angenommen global kohärent sind“, sagte Nathan Steiger, Klimawissenschaftler an der Columbia University in New York City und Mitautor der Nature-Studie. Die aktuelle Erwärmungsperiode „steht in starkem Kontrast“ zur heutigen Erwärmung, fügte er hinzu und nannte sie „eine global kohärente Erwärmungsperiode, die sich sehr von dem unterscheidet, was wir in der Vergangenheit sehen“. Für die Studie von Nature Geoscience zeichneten die Forscher die globalen Temperaturdurchschnitte im Laufe der Zeit auf und verglichen die Daten dann mit einer Reihe von Klimasimulationen, um herauszufinden, was die Veränderungen ausgelöst haben könnte. Neukom und seine Kollegen fanden heraus, dass die schnellste Erwärmung in den letzten zwei Jahrtausenden in der zweiten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts stattfand. Die Forscher fanden auch heraus, dass sich die Hauptursache für Temperaturschwankungen im Laufe der Zeit veränderte. Vor 1850 waren Schwankungen hauptsächlich mit Vulkanausbrüchen verbunden, die den Planeten abkühlten, indem sie sonnenblockierende Asche in die Stratosphäre spuckten; nach 1850 übernahmen die treibhausgasemissionen das lenkrad. „Es ist aufregend, Studien wie diese zu sehen, die rigorose Statistiken mit riesigen Datenbanken kombinieren, um klare Schlussfolgerungen über den Klimawandel in der Vergangenheit zu ziehen“, sagte Gabriela Serrato Marks, eine Doktorandin der Paläoklimatologie am Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, die es nicht war an der neuen Forschung beteiligt. Serrato Marks sagte, die von den Forschern verwendeten Aufzeichnungen könnten unvollständig sein, und fügte hinzu, dass nachfolgende Forschungen von robusteren Daten profitieren könnten. „Zukünftige Studien werden noch stärker mit Daten aus der südlichen Hemisphäre und mehr hochauflösenden Daten gestärkt“, sagte sie. Jennifer Hertzberg, Paläoklimatologin an der Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, die nicht an der Forschung beteiligt war, nannte die Studie „sehr wichtig“ und lobte die Verwendung mehrerer statistischer Methoden zur Rekonstruktion von Temperaturänderungen im Laufe der Zeit. Sie forderte die Öffentlichkeit auf, sich die Ergebnisse zu Herzen zu nehmen. „Die globalen Temperaturen, die wir jetzt sehen, sind höher als in den letzten 2.000 Jahren“, sagte sie. „Was wir jetzt sehen, ist Neuland. Es ist an der Zeit, dass alle aufwachen und jetzt Änderungen vornehmen.“ Willst du mehr Geschichten über Wissenschaft? Folgen Sie NBC News MACH auf Twitter, Facebook und Instagram.

acd7cfb8	Laut der bisher umfassendsten Analyse der Auswirkungen des Ernährungssystems auf die Umwelt ist eine enorme Reduzierung des Fleischverzehrs unerlässlich, um einen gefährlichen Klimawandel zu vermeiden. In den westlichen Ländern muss der Rindfleischkonsum um 90 % sinken und durch fünfmal mehr Bohnen und Hülsenfrüchte ersetzt werden. Die Forschung stellt auch fest, dass enorme Veränderungen in der Landwirtschaft erforderlich sind, um zu verhindern, dass die Fähigkeit des Planeten zerstört wird, die 10 Milliarden Menschen zu ernähren, die voraussichtlich in einigen Jahrzehnten auf dem Planeten leben werden. Die Nahrungsmittelproduktion verursacht bereits jetzt große Umweltschäden durch Treibhausgase aus der Viehzucht, Entwaldung und Wasserknappheit durch die Landwirtschaft und durch die landwirtschaftliche Verschmutzung riesige tote Zonen der Ozeane. Aber ohne Maßnahmen werden die Auswirkungen noch viel schlimmer, da die Weltbevölkerung bis 2050 um 2,3 Milliarden Menschen ansteigt und sich das globale Einkommen verdreifacht, wodurch mehr Menschen eine fleischreiche westliche Ernährung zu sich nehmen können. Diese Flugbahn würde kritische Umweltgrenzen sprengen, jenseits derer die Menschheit kämpfen wird, um zu leben, wie die neue Forschung zeigt. „Es ist ziemlich schockierend“, sagte Marco Springmann von der Universität Oxford, der das Forschungsteam leitete. „Wir riskieren wirklich die Nachhaltigkeit des gesamten Systems. Wenn wir daran interessiert sind, dass Menschen Landwirtschaft betreiben und essen können, dann sollten wir das besser nicht tun.“ „Die Ernährung einer Weltbevölkerung von 10 Milliarden ist möglich, aber nur, wenn wir die Art und Weise ändern, wie wir essen und Lebensmittel produzieren“, sagte Prof. Johan Rockström vom Potsdam-Institut für Klimafolgenforschung in Deutschland, der Teil des Forschungsteams war . „Den Lebensmittelsektor umweltfreundlicher gestalten oder unseren Planeten auffressen: Das steht heute auf dem Speiseplan.“ Die neue Studie folgt auf die Veröffentlichung eines wegweisenden UN-Berichts am Montag, in dem die führenden Wissenschaftler der Welt davor warnten, dass es nur ein Dutzend Jahre gibt, um die globale Erwärmung unter 1,5 ° C zu halten, darüber hinaus wird sogar ein halbes Grad das Dürrerisiko erheblich verschlimmern. Überschwemmungen und extreme Hitze. Der Bericht sagte, dass es wichtig sei, weniger Fleisch und Milchprodukte zu essen, aber dass die aktuellen Trends in die entgegengesetzte Richtung gingen. Die neue Studie, die in der Zeitschrift Nature veröffentlicht wurde, ist die bisher gründlichste und kombinierteste Datensammlung aus allen Ländern, um die Auswirkungen der Lebensmittelproduktion auf die globale Umwelt zu bewerten. Anschließend wurde untersucht, was getan werden könnte, um die drohende Nahrungsmittelkrise zu stoppen. „Es gibt kein Wundermittel“, sagte Springmann. „Aber diätetische und technologische Veränderungen [auf landwirtschaftlichen Betrieben] sind die beiden wesentlichen Dinge, und hoffentlich können sie durch die Reduzierung von Lebensmittelverlusten und -verschwendung ergänzt werden.“ Etwa ein Drittel der heute produzierten Lebensmittel kommt nie auf den Tisch. Die Forscher stellten fest, dass eine globale Umstellung auf eine „flexitäre“ Ernährung erforderlich war, um den Klimawandel sogar unter 2 ° C zu halten, geschweige denn unter 1,5 ° C. Diese flexitäre Ernährung bedeutet, dass der durchschnittliche Weltbürger 75 % weniger Rindfleisch, 90 % weniger Schweinefleisch und die Hälfte der Eier essen muss, während sich der Verbrauch von Bohnen und Hülsenfrüchten verdreifacht und Nüsse und Samen vervierfacht. Dadurch würden die Emissionen der Viehhaltung halbiert und ein besseres Güllemanagement würde weitere Einsparungen ermöglichen. In reichen Nationen sind die erforderlichen Ernährungsumstellungen immer krasser. Die Bürger des Vereinigten Königreichs und der USA müssen Rindfleisch um 90 % und Milch um 60 % reduzieren und gleichzeitig Bohnen und Hülsenfrüchte um das Vier- bis Sechsfache erhöhen. Die Millionen von Menschen in armen Ländern, die unterernährt sind, müssen jedoch etwas mehr Fleisch und Milchprodukte essen. Die Reduzierung des Fleischkonsums könnte durch eine Mischung aus Bildung, Steuern, Subventionen für pflanzliche Lebensmittel und Änderungen der Schul- und Arbeitsplatzmenüs erreicht werden, sagten die Wissenschaftler. Um Entwaldung, Wasserknappheit und Umweltverschmutzung durch übermäßigen Einsatz von Düngemitteln zu stoppen, sind tiefgreifende Änderungen der landwirtschaftlichen Praktiken erforderlich. Dazu gehören die Steigerung der Ernteerträge in ärmeren Ländern, eine universellere Wasserspeicherung und ein weitaus sparsamerer Umgang mit Düngemitteln. „Ich war überrascht, dass wir eine Kombination sehr ambitionierter Optionen brauchen“, sagte Springmann. „Wir müssen wirklich an den Rand des Möglichen gehen.“ Alle Ernährungs- und Landwirtschaftsoptionen werden bereits irgendwo auf der Welt umgesetzt, sagte Springmann. In den Niederlanden und Israel werden Düngemittel und Wasser besser genutzt, während bei jungen Menschen in einigen Städten große Einschnitte beim Fleischkonsum zu beobachten sind. Aber ein globaler Wandel sei nötig, sagte er: „Ich denke, wir können das schaffen, aber wir brauchen wirklich viel proaktivere Regierungen, um die richtigen Rahmenbedingungen zu schaffen. Die Menschen können einen persönlichen Unterschied machen, indem sie ihre Ernährung ändern, aber auch, indem sie an die Türen ihrer Politiker klopfen und sagen, wir brauchen bessere Umweltvorschriften – das ist auch sehr wichtig. Politiker nicht vom Haken lassen.“ Prof. Tim Benton von der University of Leeds, der nicht Teil des Forschungsteams war, sagte: „Letztendlich leben wir auf einem endlichen Planeten mit endlichen Ressourcen. Es ist eine Fiktion, sich vorzustellen, dass es eine technologische Lösung gibt, die es uns ermöglicht, so viele Lebensmittel zu produzieren, wie wir nur wollen, und uns erlaubt, zu viel zu essen und Lebensmittel wegzuwerfen.“ Er sagte, die Umweltbelastung durch das derzeitige Ernährungssystem „untergrabe die Fähigkeit zukünftiger Generationen, auf einem stabilen und ökologisch reichen Planeten zu leben“. Prof. Peter Smith von der University of Aberdeen, der ebenfalls nicht Teil des Forschungsteams war, sagte: „Wir wissen, dass die Auswahl von Lebensmitteln sehr persönlich ist und dass es schwierig sein kann, eine Verhaltensänderung zu fördern, aber die Beweise sind jetzt eindeutig – wir müssen es tun unsere Ernährung ändern, wenn wir eine nachhaltige Zukunft haben wollen. Die Tatsache, dass es uns auch gesünder macht, macht es zu einem Kinderspiel.“	Enorme Reduzierung des Fleischverzehrs „wesentlich“, um den Zusammenbruch des Klimas zu vermeiden	true
70c53cf5	"Der Text im obigen Video wurde am 1. Juni 2018 bearbeitet, um deutlich zu machen, dass es unmöglich ist zu wissen, warum der abgebildete Eisbär verhungert ist. Eine frühere Version des Videos ging zu weit, indem sie nahelegte, dass der Klimawandel dafür verantwortlich sei (weiterlesen). Diese Geschichte wurde am 19. Januar 2018 aktualisiert, um den genaueren Ort wiederzugeben, an dem die Fotos aufgenommen wurden. Als der Fotograf Paul Nicklen und Filmemacher der Naturschutzgruppe Sea Legacy im Spätsommer auf Somerset Island – in der Nähe der größeren Baffininsel – in der kanadischen Arktis ankamen, stießen sie auf einen herzzerreißenden Anblick: einen verhungernden Eisbären auf seinem Sterbebett. Bären sind Nicklen nicht fremd. Seit seiner Kindheit im hohen Norden Kanadas hat der Biologe und Tierfotograf über 3.000 Bären in freier Wildbahn gesehen. Aber der abgemagerte Eisbär, der in Videos zu sehen war, die Nicklen am 5. Dezember in den sozialen Medien veröffentlichte, war einer der herzzerreißendsten Anblicke, die er je gesehen hat. „Wir standen weinend da und filmten mit Tränen, die uns über die Wangen liefen“, sagte er. Das Video zeigt den Eisbären, der sich ans Leben klammert, sein weißes Haar bedeckt schlaff seinen dünnen, knochigen Körper. Eines der Hinterbeine des Bären schleift beim Gehen hinterher, wahrscheinlich aufgrund von Muskelatrophie. Auf der Suche nach Nahrung durchwühlt der Eisbär langsam einen nahe gelegenen Mülleimer, der saisonal von Inuit-Fischern genutzt wird. Es findet nichts und lässt sich resigniert wieder auf den Boden fallen. In den Tagen, seit Nicklen das Filmmaterial veröffentlichte, wurde er gefragt, warum er nicht eingegriffen habe. „Natürlich ist mir das durch den Kopf gegangen“, sagte Nicklen. „Aber es ist nicht so, dass ich mit einer Betäubungspistole oder 400 Pfund Robbenfleisch herumlaufe.“ Und selbst wenn, sagte Nicklen, hätte er das Elend des Bären nur verlängert. Außerdem ist das Füttern von wilden Eisbären in Kanada illegal. Der Naturfotograf sagt, er habe den langsamen, bedrängten Tod des Bären gefilmt, weil er nicht wollte, dass er umsonst stirbt. „Wenn Wissenschaftler sagen, dass Bären aussterben, möchte ich, dass die Leute erkennen, wie es aussieht. Bären werden verhungern“, sagte Nicklen. ""So sieht ein verhungernder Bär aus."" Die Verbindung zum Klimawandel? Indem er die Geschichte eines Eisbären erzählt, hofft Nicklen, eine umfassendere Botschaft darüber zu vermitteln, wie eine Klimaerwärmung tödliche Folgen hat. Eisbären sind seit langem unwissende Maskottchen für die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels. Als Tiere, die nur in arktischen Regionen leben, sind sie oft die ersten, die die Auswirkungen der Erwärmung und des steigenden Meeresspiegels spüren. Die großen Bären von einer halben Tonne finden auf dem Meereis Ansammlungen von Robben. Während der Sommermonate ist es nicht ungewöhnlich, dass Eisbären monatelang nichts essen, während sie darauf warten, dass sich das arktische Eis verfestigt. Im Jahr 2002 sagte ein Bericht des World Wildlife Fund voraus, dass der Klimawandel letztendlich zu einer Gefährdung oder Ausrottung der Eisbären führen könnte. Schon damals stellte der Bericht fest, dass Eisbären früher vom Eis an Land zogen und länger an Land blieben, was die Fastenzeit der Bären ungesund verlängerte. Am Ende des Sommers zeigten die meisten vom World Wildlife Fund untersuchten Bären Anzeichen von Hunger. Fünfzehn Jahre später sind die eisigen Jagdgründe der Eisbären in einem noch schlimmeren Zustand. Das National Snow and Ice Data Center, das die Meereisbedeckung jährlich verfolgt, hat regelmäßig Rekordtiefs in der Meereisbedeckung festgestellt – ein Rückgang, der sich voraussichtlich noch verschlimmern wird. (Lesen Sie mehr über drastische Vorhersagen für schwindendes Meereis.) Eine kürzlich in der Zeitschrift Biosciences veröffentlichte Studie untersuchte, wie oft die Klimawissenschaft fälschlicherweise diskreditiert wird. Die Studie ergab, dass Klimaleugner in der Lage sind, die Bedrohung durch den Klimawandel herunterzuspielen, indem sie die Bedrohung, der Eisbären ausgesetzt sind, diskreditieren.

00c29642	Worst-Case-Szenarien für die globale Erwärmung müssen angesichts eines besseren Verständnisses der Rolle der Wolken möglicherweise nach oben korrigiert werden, so die Wissenschaftler. Jüngste Modelldaten deuten darauf hin, dass das Klima wesentlich empfindlicher auf Kohlenstoffemissionen reagiert als bisher angenommen, und Experten sagten, die Projektionen hätten das Potenzial, „unglaublich alarmierend“ zu sein, obwohl sie betonten, dass weitere Untersuchungen erforderlich seien, um die neuen Zahlen zu validieren. Modellierungsergebnisse von mehr als 20 Institutionen werden für die sechste Bewertung des Zwischenstaatlichen Ausschusses der Vereinten Nationen für Klimaänderungen zusammengestellt, die nächstes Jahr veröffentlicht werden soll. Verglichen mit der letzten Bewertung im Jahr 2014 zeigen 25 % von ihnen eine starke Aufwärtsverschiebung von 3 °C auf 5 °C in der Klimasensitivität – das Ausmaß der Erwärmung, das von einer Verdopplung des atmosphärischen Kohlendioxids gegenüber dem vorindustriellen Niveau von 280 Teilen pro Million projiziert wird. Dies hat viele erfahrene Beobachter schockiert, da die Annahmen zur Klimasensitivität seit den 1980er Jahren relativ unverändert geblieben sind. „Das ist sehr besorgniserregend“, sagte Johan Rockström, Direktor des Potsdam-Instituts für Klimafolgenforschung. „Klimasensitivität ist der heilige Gral der Klimawissenschaft. Es ist der wichtigste Indikator für Klimarisiken. Seit 40 Jahren liegt sie bei etwa 3°C. Jetzt sehen wir plötzlich große Klimamodelle auf den besten Supercomputern, die zeigen, dass die Dinge schlimmer sein könnten, als wir dachten.“ Er sagte, dass die Klimasensitivität über 5 °C den Spielraum für menschliches Handeln einschränken würde, um die schlimmsten Auswirkungen der globalen Erwärmung zu reduzieren. „Wir hätten keinen Platz mehr für eine sanfte Landung von 1,5 °C [über dem vorindustriellen Niveau]. Das Beste, was wir anstreben könnten, sind 2 °C“, sagte er. Worst-Case-Prognosen von über 5 °C wurden von mehreren der weltweit führenden Klimaforschungseinrichtungen erstellt, darunter das Hadley Centre des UK Met Office und das Community Earth System Model der EU. Timothy Palmer, Professor für Klimaphysik an der Universität Oxford und Mitglied des Beirats des Met Office, sagte, die hohe Zahl habe Wissenschaftler zunächst nervös gemacht. „Es lag weit außerhalb früherer Schätzungen. Die Leute fragten, ob es einen Fehler im Code gebe“, sagte er. „Aber es lief auf relativ kleine Änderungen in der Darstellung von Wolken in den Modellen hinaus.“ Die Rolle von Wolken ist einer der unsichersten Bereiche in der Klimawissenschaft, da sie schwer zu messen sind und je nach Höhe, Tröpfchentemperatur und anderen Faktoren entweder eine wärmende oder eine kühlende Rolle spielen können. Jahrzehntelang stand dies im Mittelpunkt heftiger akademischer Auseinandersetzungen. Frühere IPCC-Berichte gingen tendenziell davon aus, dass Wolken einen neutralen Einfluss haben würden, da sich die Erwärmungs- und Abkühlungsrückkopplungen gegenseitig aufheben würden. Aber in den letzten anderthalb Jahren mehrten sich die Beweise dafür, dass der Nettoeffekt eine Erwärmung sein wird. Dies basiert auf Computermodellen mit feinerer Auflösung und fortschrittlicher Wolkenmikrophysik. „Wolken werden das Schicksal der Menschheit bestimmen – ob das Klima eine existenzielle Bedrohung oder eine Unannehmlichkeit ist, mit der wir leben lernen werden“, sagte Palmer. „Neueste Modelle deuten darauf hin, dass Wolken die Sache verschlimmern werden.“ In einem kürzlich erschienenen Artikel in der Zeitschrift Nature erklärt Palmer, wie das neue Hadley Center-Modell, das die 5+C-Zahl zur Klimasensitivität lieferte, getestet wurde, indem seine Genauigkeit bei der Vorhersage kurzfristigen Wetters bewertet wurde. Diese Testtechnik hatte Fehler in früheren Modellen aufgedeckt, aber im letzten Fall bestätigten die Ergebnisse die Schätzungen. „Die Ergebnisse sind nicht beruhigend – sie stützen die Schätzungen“, schrieb er. Er fordert, dass andere Modelle auf ähnliche Weise getestet werden. „Es ist wirklich wichtig. Die Botschaft an Regierung und Öffentlichkeit lautet: Sie müssen diese hohe Klimasensibilität ernst nehmen. [Wir] müssen die Emissionen so schnell wie möglich senken“, sagte er. Es wird erwartet, dass der IPCC die 5+C-Klimasensitivitätszahl in seinen nächsten Bericht über die Bandbreite möglicher Ergebnisse aufnehmen wird. Wissenschaftler warnen davor, dass dies noch in Arbeit ist und dass Zweifel bestehen bleiben, da eine so hohe Zahl nicht mit historischen Aufzeichnungen übereinstimmt. Catherine Senior, Leiterin für das Verständnis des Klimawandels am Met Office Hadley Centre, sagte, dass mehr Studien und mehr Daten erforderlich seien, um die Rolle von Wolken und Aerosolen vollständig zu verstehen. „Diese Zahl hat das Potenzial, unglaublich alarmierend zu sein, wenn sie stimmt“, sagte sie. „Aber als Wissenschaftler ist meine erste Antwort: Warum hat das Modell das getan? Wir befinden uns noch in der Phase der Bewertung der Prozesse, die zu den unterschiedlichen Reaktionen führen.“ Rockström räumte zwar die anhaltende Unsicherheit ein, sagte aber, Klimamodelle könnten das Problem immer noch unterschätzen, weil sie Kipppunkte in der Biosphäre nicht vollständig berücksichtigten. „Je mehr wir lernen, desto zerbrechlicher scheint das Erdsystem zu sein und desto schneller müssen wir uns bewegen“, sagte er. „Es ist ein noch stärkeres Argument, aus dieser Covid-19-Krise herauszutreten und mit voller Kraft auf die Dekarbonisierung der Wirtschaft hinzuarbeiten.“	Klima-Worst-Case-Szenarien gehen möglicherweise nicht weit genug, wie Wolkendaten zeigen	partially false
a73a57a1	Laut einer Studie des unabhängigen Wissenschaftlers Dr. Indur Goklany für die Global Warming Policy Foundation gibt es keinen „Klimanotstand“. Goklany kommt zu dem Schluss: Während sich das Klima möglicherweise wärmer verändert hat: • Die meisten extremen Wetterphänomene sind nicht extremer, tödlicher oder zerstörerischer geworden. • Empirische Beweise widersprechen direkt der Behauptung, dass erhöhtes Kohlendioxid das menschliche Wohlbefinden verringert hat. Tatsächlich war das Wohlergehen der Menschen nie höher. • Welche nachteiligen Auswirkungen die Erwärmung und der Anstieg des Kohlendioxids auch immer auf terrestrische Arten und Ökosysteme gehabt haben mögen, sie wurden durch den Beitrag fossiler Brennstoffe zu einer erhöhten biologischen Produktivität überschwemmt. Dies hat die Verringerung des Verlusts von Lebensräumen gestoppt und umgekehrt. Der Bericht wird für alle prominenten Umweltaktivisten – von Papst und Doom Goblin Greta Thunberg bis zu Klaus Schwab von Great Reset –, die den „Klimanotstand“ vorangetrieben haben, eine äußerst deprimierende Lektüre sein. Narrativ. Es ist ein Glaubensartikel für die globalistische Elite und ihre nützlichen Idioten in den Medien, in der Politik, in der Wirtschaft und der Unterhaltung, dass die Welt auf eine Klimakatastrophe zusteuert, die nur durch radikale und kostspielige internationale Maßnahmen verhindert werden kann. Aber Goklanys Bericht – Impacts of Climate Change: Perception & Reality – behauptet, dass es wenig oder gar keine Beweise gibt, die das Narrativ der Angst stützen. Am Ende liefert Goklany eine Tabelle, in der er alle Panikmache-Behauptungen von Umweltgruppen aufführt – und sie dann mit der beobachteten Realität vergleicht. Nur eine der Behauptungen steht laut der Studie – das Wetter ist etwas wärmer geworden: mehr heiße Tage und weniger kalte Tage – ja Wirbelstürme/Hurrikane intensiver oder häufiger – nein Tornados nehmen zu und werden intensiver – keine Überschwemmungen häufiger und intensiver – nein Dürren häufiger und intensiver – nein Von Waldbränden verbrannte Fläche nimmt zu – nein (Fläche erreichte Mitte des 19 Cent seit 1961) Landfläche und Strände schrumpfen, Koralleninseln untergetaucht – Nein. (Marginale Expansion) Auch die unterschusternden Behauptungen über einen Rückgang des menschlichen Wohlergehens halten sich laut der Studie nicht. Der Zugang zu sauberem Wasser hat zugenommen; die Sterblichkeit durch „extreme Wetterereignisse“ ist seit den 1920er Jahren um 99 Prozent zurückgegangen; weniger Menschen sterben an Hitze; die Sterblichkeitsraten durch klimaempfindliche Krankheiten wie Malaria und Durchfall sind zurückgegangen (seit 1900 sind die Sterblichkeitsraten bei Malaria um 96 Prozent zurückgegangen); Hungerraten sind zurückgegangen; die Armut ist zurückgegangen (das Pro-Kopf-BIP hat sich seit 1950 vervierfacht, obwohl sich die CO2-Werte versechsfacht haben); die Lebenserwartung hat sich seit Beginn der Industrialisierung mehr als verdoppelt; die gesundheitsbereinigte Lebenserwartung ist gestiegen; die globale Ungleichheit in Bezug auf Einkommen, Lebenserwartung und Zugang zu modernen Annehmlichkeiten hat abgenommen; die Erde ist grüner und produktiver; Der durch die Landwirtschaft verlorene Lebensraum hat aufgrund von Technologien, die von fossilen Brennstoffen abhängig sind, einen Höhepunkt erreicht. Für grüne Aktivisten wird es schwer sein, Goklany als „Leugner“ abzutun. Seine Referenzen als Klimaexperte sind tadellos. Er war Mitglied der US-Delegation, die den Zwischenstaatlichen Ausschuss für Klimaänderungen (IPCC) gründete, und half bei der Entwicklung seines ersten Bewertungsberichts. Anschließend diente er als US-Delegierter beim IPCC und als IPCC-Gutachter. Goklany sagt: Fast überall, wo man hinschaut, hat der Klimawandel nur kleine und oft harmlose Auswirkungen. Die Auswirkungen extremer Wetterereignisse – Hurrikane, Tornados, Überschwemmungen und Dürren – sind eher rückläufig. Die wirtschaftlichen Schäden sind als Bruchteil des globalen BIP zurückgegangen. Die Sterblichkeitsraten bei solchen Ereignissen sind seit den 1920er Jahren um 99 % zurückgegangen. Klimabedingte Krankheiten sind zusammengebrochen. Und bei Kälte sterben mehr Menschen als bei Wärme. Selbst der Anstieg des Meeresspiegels – der voraussichtlich die schädlichste Auswirkung der globalen Erwärmung ist – scheint den Ergebnissen der Studie zufolge viel weniger ein Problem zu sein als gedacht. Goklany sagt: Eine kürzlich durchgeführte Studie hat gezeigt, dass die Erde in den letzten 30 Jahren in Küstengebieten tatsächlich mehr Land hinzugewonnen hat, als sie durch den Anstieg des Meeresspiegels verloren hat. Wir wissen jetzt mit Sicherheit, dass Korallenatolle nicht verschwinden und sogar Bangladesch durch Verschlammung mehr Land gewinnt, als es durch steigende Meere verliert. In seinem Bericht zerstört Goklany viele der Schlagworte der grünen Bewegung, einschließlich der Vorstellung, dass fossile Brennstoffe schlecht für den Planeten sind. Er schlägt vor, dass ihr CO2 nicht nur zur „globalen Ökologisierung“ beigetragen hat – „entgegen der vorherrschenden Meinung hat die Baumbedeckung weltweit zwischen 1982 und 2016 um über 2 Millionen km2 zugenommen, eine Zunahme von 7 Prozent“ – sondern sie liefern auch die Düngemittel und Pestizide, die gleichzeitig den Planeten ernähren und den landwirtschaftlichen Flächenbedarf reduzieren:	Delingpole: Studie bestreitet, dass sich die Erde in einem „Klimanotstand“ befindet	partially false
648e6bc4	Trotz der jüngsten Versuche, die Vereinigten Staaten als großen globalen Umweltverschmutzer hinzustellen, gehören die USA laut der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) zu den saubersten Nationen der Welt. Im jüngsten WHO-Bericht zur Luftverschmutzung wurden die Vereinigten Staaten als eines der Länder mit der saubersten Luft der Welt aufgeführt, deutlich sauberer als die Luft in Deutschland, Italien, der Schweiz, Großbritannien, Japan, Österreich und Frankreich . Während Frankreich und andere G7-Staaten den Ausstieg der USA aus dem Pariser Klimaabkommen beklagten, ist Amerikas Luft bereits sauberer als in jedem anderen Land der G7, mit Ausnahme Kanadas mit seiner geringen Bevölkerungszahl. Gemäß der üblichen Praxis misst die WHO die Luftverschmutzung anhand der durchschnittlichen jährlichen Konzentration feiner Schwebeteilchen mit einem Durchmesser von weniger als 2,5 Mikrometern. Dies sind die Partikel, die Krankheiten aller Art verursachen und für die meisten Todesfälle durch Luftverschmutzung verantwortlich sind. Laut WHO erhöht die Exposition gegenüber Feinstaub das Risiko für akute Infektionen der unteren Atemwege, chronisch obstruktive Lungenerkrankungen, Herzerkrankungen, Schlaganfall und Lungenkrebs. Der Bericht, der die „jährliche mittlere Konzentration von Feinstaub mit einem aerodynamischen Durchmesser von 2,5 μm oder weniger (PM2,5) sowohl für die städtische Bevölkerung als auch für die ländliche und städtische Bevölkerung“ analysierte, stellte fest, dass die Vereinigten Staaten zu den saubersten gehörten Nationen der Welt. Die jährlichen mittleren Konzentrationen von Feinstaub in der Luft reichen von weniger als 10 bis über 100 µg/m3, heißt es in dem Bericht. Am unteren Ende des Spektrums haben die Vereinigten Staaten eine Konzentration von nur 8, während China mit 59 eine mehr als siebenmal höhere Konzentration, Indien mit 66, Ägypten mit 101 und Saudi-Arabien mit der schlimmsten Luftverschmutzung mit 127 aufweist. „Die durchschnittliche jährliche Konzentration feiner Schwebeteilchen mit einem Durchmesser von weniger als 2,5 Mikrometer ist ein gängiges Maß für die Luftverschmutzung“, erklärt die WHO. Der WHO-Bericht wird durch eine Reihe anderer derartiger Studien zur Luft- und Wasserverschmutzung bestätigt. In einer kürzlich erschienenen Liste der 25 saubersten Städte der Welt waren die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika das einzige Land, das drei Städte unter den saubersten der Welt vorweisen konnte, wobei Chicago auf dem zweiten Platz, Honolulu auf dem vierten und Portland, OR, kommt auf den sechzehnten Platz. Es überrascht nicht, dass es überhaupt keine Städte aus China, Russland oder Indien auf die Liste geschafft haben. In ähnlicher Weise enthielt eine andere Liste der 15 am stärksten verschmutzten Städte der Welt drei Städte aus China, drei Städte aus Saudi-Arabien und satte sieben Städte aus Indien. Keine US-Stadt hat es auf die Liste geschafft. Eine dritte Liste, die die zehn saubersten und zehn am stärksten verschmutzten Städte der Welt auflistet, platzierte zwei US-Städte auf der Liste der saubersten Städte der Welt. Die Liste der am stärksten verschmutzten Städte der Welt wurde von zwei Städten aus China angeführt, gefolgt von zwei weiteren Städten aus Indien. Auch zwei russische Städte standen auf der Liste. Auch hier wurden keine US-Städte gefunden. Wie können selbst seriöse Nachrichtenagenturen wie Reuters angesichts einer so relativ sauberen Luft in ganz Amerika weiterhin die althergebrachte Lüge verbreiten, dass die Vereinigten Staaten einer der „größten Umweltverschmutzer“ der Welt sind? Anstatt der bewährten Praxis der Weltgesundheitsorganisation zu folgen, die die Konzentration krankheitsverursachender Schadstoffe misst, die in die Lungen der Menschen gelangen, haben einige ein Hütchenspiel gespielt und ein neues Maß für „Verschmutzung“ ausgetauscht, das ausschließlich auf Kohlenstoffemissionen basiert Dioxid. Das Problem bei diesem Trick ist, dass Kohlendioxid kein Schadstoff ist, und es ist unehrlich, dies zu behaupten. CO2 ist farblos, geruchlos und völlig ungiftig. Pflanzen sind darauf angewiesen, um zu leben und zu wachsen, und Menschen nehmen mit jedem Atemzug etwas davon in ihre Lungen auf, ohne dass dies irgendwelche negativen Auswirkungen hat. Züchter pumpen regelmäßig CO2 in Gewächshäuser und erhöhen das Niveau auf das Dreifache der natürlichen Umgebung, um stärkere, grünere und gesündere Pflanzen zu produzieren. Die derzeitige Kohlendioxidkonzentration in der Umwelt ist wesentlich niedriger als in früheren Perioden der Erdgeschichte. Ohne menschliches Eingreifen ist die CO2-Konzentration in früheren Epochen auf bis zu 7.000 Teile pro Million (ppm) gestiegen, während die Konzentration derzeit knapp über 400 ppm liegt. Einige Experten, wie der UN-Klimawissenschaftler Dr. Indur Goklany, haben die steigenden CO2-Werte als etwas Gutes für die Menschheit verteidigt. Goklany hat argumentiert, dass der steigende Kohlendioxidgehalt in der Erdatmosphäre „derzeit sowohl für die Menschheit als auch für die Biosphäre im Allgemeinen von Vorteil ist“. „Die Vorteile sind real, während die Kosten der Erwärmung ungewiss sind“, sagte er. Während die Vereinigten Staaten wachsam bleiben müssen, um das Niveau echter, gefährlicher Schadstoffe auf einem Minimum zu halten, mag es ein Trost sein, dass sie unter den G7-Staaten die sauberste Luft von allen haben.

acc4517a	Es war eine genaue und vernünftige Antwort, die Klimaalarmisten natürlich in Anfälle der Verurteilung versetzte. Die Washington Post kritisierte Pruitt als „Leugner“, getrieben von „Unvernunft“. Senator Brian Schatz aus Hawaii nannte Pruitts Ansichten „extrem“ und „unverantwortlich“ – ein Beweis für seine Unfähigkeit, die EPA zu leiten. Gina McCarthy, die die Agentur unter Präsident Obama leitete, beklagte die Gefahr, die die globale Erwärmung „für uns alle darstellt, die die Erde ihr Zuhause nennen“, und sagte, sie könne sich „nicht vorstellen, welche zusätzlichen Informationen [Pruitt] von Wissenschaftlern verlangen könnte“, um dies zu tun verstehe das. Antwortete Pruitt: „Nein. Ich denke, dass es sehr schwierig ist, die menschliche Aktivität auf das Klima genau zu messen, und es gibt enorme Meinungsverschiedenheiten über das Ausmaß der Auswirkungen. Also nein – ich würde nicht zustimmen, dass es ein Hauptfaktor für die globale Erwärmung ist, die wir sehen. Aber das wissen wir noch nicht. Wir müssen die Debatte fortsetzen und die Überprüfung und Analyse fortsetzen.“ „Glauben Sie“, fragte Joe Kernen von CNBC letzten Donnerstag in einem Interview mit Scott Pruitt, dem neuen Direktor der Environmental Protection Agency, „dass bewiesen ist, dass CO2 der wichtigste Regler für das Klima ist?“ Doch trotz all des Hyperventilierens war Pruitts Antwort auf die Frage, die ihm gestellt wurde – ob Kohlendioxid der „primäre Kontrollknopf“ des Klimas ist – völlig vernünftig. „Das wissen wir noch nicht“, sagte er. Wir nicht. CO2 ist sicherlich ein wärmespeicherndes Treibhausgas, aber kaum das primäre: Wasserdampf macht etwa 95 Prozent der Treibhausgase aus. Im Gegensatz dazu ist Kohlendioxid in der Atmosphäre nur ein Spurenbestandteil: etwa 400 ppm (parts per million) oder 0,04 Prozent. Außerdem nimmt seine wärmende Wirkung nach den ersten 20 oder 30 ppm stark ab. Der Atmosphäre mehr CO2-Moleküle hinzuzufügen, ist wie eine rote Wand mit weißer Farbe zu übermalen – der erste Anstrich erledigt die meiste Arbeit, um das Rot zu kaschieren. Ein zweiter Anstrich hat viel weniger Wirkung, während ein dritter oder vierter Anstrich fast überhaupt keine Auswirkungen hat. Es gibt eine populäre Theorie, dass atmosphärisches CO2 die Entstehung von Wasserdampf verstärkt und dadurch die Erwärmung durch eine „positive Rückkopplungsschleife“ erhöht. Aber diese Theorie ist bisher größtenteils spekulativ; Klimaprojektionen, die darauf basierende Modelle verwenden, sind durchweg gescheitert und haben fast immer eine weitaus stärkere Erwärmung vorhergesagt, als tatsächlich eingetreten ist. Es versteht sich von selbst, dass, wenn Wissenschaftler noch keine genauen Vorhersagen über den zukünftigen Klimawandel treffen können, ihr Verständnis der Klimawissenschaft höchst unvollständig bleibt. Das Klimasystem der Erde ist unergründlich komplex. Es wird von unzähligen interagierenden Variablen beeinflusst, wobei der atmosphärische CO2-Gehalt nur einer ist. Je mehr Variablen es in einem System oder einer Folge von Ereignissen gibt, desto geringer ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass sie alle eintreten. Ihre Chancen, das Ergebnis einer geworfenen Münze richtig zu erraten, sind 1 zu 2, aber Ihre Chancen, zweimal hintereinander richtig zu erraten, sind nur 1 zu 4 – d.h. ½ x ½. Die Verlängerung Ihrer Siegesserie auf einen dritten Tipp ist sogar noch unwahrscheinlicher: nur 1 von 8. Wenden Sie diesen Ansatz auf den Klimawandel an, und es wird klar, warum die beste Antwort auf die hektischen Vorhersagen der Alarmisten eine gesunde Skepsis ist. Die Liste der Variablen, die das Klima beeinflussen, umfasst Wolkenbildung, Topographie, Höhe, Nähe zum Äquator, Plattentektonik, Sonnenfleckenzyklen, vulkanische Aktivität, Expansion oder Kontraktion des Meereises, Umwandlung von Land in Landwirtschaft, Entwaldung, Wiederaufforstung, Windrichtung, Bodenqualität, El Niño- und La Niña-Ozeanzyklen, Verbreitung von Aerosolen (Ruß, Staub und Salz in der Luft) – und natürlich atmosphärische Treibhausgase, sowohl natürliche als auch vom Menschen verursachte. Eine umfassende Liste würde Hunderte, wenn nicht Tausende von Elementen umfassen, von denen Wissenschaftler keines mit absoluter Präzision zu verstehen beanspruchen würden. Aber um der Argumentation willen sagen wir, dass es nur 15 Variablen gibt, die an der Vorhersage des globalen Klimawandels beteiligt sind, und gehen davon aus, dass Klimatologen jede einzelne mit einer nahezu perfekten Genauigkeit von 95 Prozent gemeistert haben. Wie stehen die Chancen, dass ein Klimamodell, das auf einem so einfachen System basiert, zuverlässig wäre? Weniger als 50/50. (Die 15-fache Multiplikation von 0,95 mit sich selbst ergibt 46,3 Prozent.) Ist es eine Überraschung, dass Vorhersagen zum Klimawandel in der realen Welt – wo die Komplexität exponentiell größer und die Genauigkeit des Wissens viel geringer ist – eine so schlechte Bilanz haben? Pruitt hat es richtig gemacht: Die Messung der menschlichen Auswirkungen auf das Klima ist in der Tat „sehr herausfordernd“. Die Wissenschaft ist noch lange nicht am Ende. Aus diesem Grund sind Aufrufe zur radikalen Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen so unverantwortlich – und deshalb sind düstere Warnungen vor dem, was passieren wird, wenn wir es nicht tun, kaum besser als rücksichtslose Panikmache.

63b1812f	Hurrikan Florence ist nicht der Klimawandel oder die globale Erwärmung. Es ist nur das Wetter. Hurrikan Florence ist nicht das Ergebnis der globalen Erwärmung. Es ist wahrscheinlich auf natürliche Wettermuster zurückzuführen, nicht auf den Klimawandel, wie einige bereits gesagt haben. Noch bevor der Hurrikan Florence irgendwo in der Nähe der Grenze zwischen North und South Carolina auf Land traf, wurden die prognostizierten Schäden durch potenziell katastrophale Überschwemmungen durch den Sturm bereits der globalen Erwärmung zugeschrieben. Kristina Dahl, die für NBC News schrieb, behauptete: „Mit jedem neuen Sturm sind wir gezwungen, uns zu fragen, ob dies unsere neue, vom Klimawandel angetriebene Realität ist, und uns zu fragen, was wir tun können, um den Tribut von aufgeladenen Stürmen zu minimieren.“ Die Theorie besagt, dass tropische Wirbelstürme ihre Geschwindigkeit in den letzten 70 Jahren um etwa 10 Prozent verlangsamt haben, weil sich der Jetstream weiter nördlich zurückzieht, Stürme die Lenkströmungen nimmt und sie zum Stillstand bringt und an einem Ort weiter regnet. So geschehen letztes Jahr beim Hurrikan Harvey in Houston. Aber wie bei den meisten Behauptungen zur globalen Erwärmung ist der tatsächliche Effekt gering, wahrscheinlich vorübergehend und höchstwahrscheinlich auf natürliche Wettermuster zurückzuführen. Alle Veränderungen bei Hurrikanen über 70 Jahre, selbst wenn sie real sind, können leicht Teil natürlicher Zyklen sein – oder unvollständige Daten. Sedimente von Küstenseen entlang der Küste des Golfs von Mexiko vor 1.000 bis 2.000 Jahren deuten auf häufigere und intensivere Hurrikane hin, als sie heute auftreten. Wieso den? Niemand weiß. Manchmal passieren in der Natur ungewöhnliche Dinge Die Massachusetts Bay Colony erlebte 1635 einen Sturm der Kategorie 3 oder 4 mit einer Sturmflut von bis zu 20 Fuß. Während ein solcher Sturm in Neuengland nicht mehr vorkommt, ereignete er sich dort 1675 erneut, wobei ältere Augenzeugen ihn mit dem Sturm von 1635 verglichen. Bis 2017 vergingen die Vereinigten Staaten 11 Jahre ohne einen größeren Hurrikan – etwas, das statistisch sehr unwahrscheinlich ist. Neun Jahre nach dieser 11-jährigen Hurrikan-Dürre berechnete ein NASA-Wissenschaftler, dass es sich um ein 1-in-177-Jahres-Ereignis handelt. Mein Punkt ist, dass die Natur variiert und manchmal ungewöhnliche Dinge passieren. Mehr: Ist Trump irgendein Halbgott, der extremes Wetter heraufbeschworen hat? Ein unkontrollierter Klimawandel könnte zu einer Katastrophe für unsere Kinder führen. Werden wir etwas tun? Wir halten unsere Klimaschutzverpflichtungen von Paris ein und unsere Volkswirtschaften boomen: Gouverneure Jetzt ist es in Mode, abwürgende Wirbelstürme auf die globale Erwärmung zu schieben. Im Fall von Florenz wird der Jetstream tatsächlich weiter nach Norden gedrängt. Aber die Untersuchung einer Wetterkarte der atmosphärischen Strömung in einer Höhe von 18.000 Fuß zeigt, dass der Jetstream weiter nach Süden über das westliche Nordamerika gedrückt wird. Diese Art natürlicher Schwankungen der atmosphärischen Strömung nennt man Wetter, nicht Klimawandel. Es ist nur ein Würfelwurf. Hurrikan-steuernde Strömungen unterliegen dem jeweiligen Wetter, wenn sie an der US-Küste ankommen. Niemand sollte den Schaden, den Florence wahrscheinlich anrichten wird, abtun oder minimieren. Hurrikans können tödlich sein. Ich stimme dem Artikel von Frau Dahl in den NBC News voll und ganz zu, dass „unsere oberste Priorität derzeit darin besteht, die Sicherheit derer zu gewährleisten, die sich auf dem sich entwickelnden Weg von Florence befinden, sowie der Ersthelfer, die ihnen helfen.“ Die Kosten von Stürmen sind gestiegen, nicht ihre Schwere. Aber ein großer Hurrikan trifft North Carolina im Durchschnitt einmal alle 20 Jahre oder so. Das letzte war Fran im Jahr 1996, also vor 22 Jahren. Küstenbewohner wissen, dass sie jährlich von Hurrikanen bedroht sind, und manchmal (wenn auch relativ selten) ist einer dieser Hurrikane sehr stark. Nun, wird uns nicht gesagt, dass diese Stürme im Durchschnitt stärker werden? Die Antwort ist nein. Die 30 teuersten Hurrikane in der Geschichte der USA (laut Bundesdaten vom Januar) zeigen im Laufe der Zeit keine Zunahme der Intensität. Die monetären Schadenskosten sind in den letzten Jahrzehnten dramatisch gestiegen, aber das liegt an der wachsenden Bevölkerung, dem Wohlstand und der Menge an gefährdeter Infrastruktur. Es liegt nicht an stärkeren Stürmen. Wenn Menschen überhaupt einen Einfluss auf Hurrikane haben, wird es wahrscheinlich noch viele Jahrzehnte dauern. Die natürliche Variabilität ist einfach zu groß. Dies sollte nicht überraschen, da die Treibhausgasemissionen der Menschheit nur eine 1-prozentige Änderung der natürlichen Energieflüsse verursacht haben, die durch das Klimasystem fließen. Roy W.

46e9b5bb	Zwei Umweltschützer haben einen „globalen Klimanotstand“ ausgerufen, nachdem festgestellt wurde, dass der Jetstream der nördlichen Hemisphäre den Äquator überquert hat, was zu „beispiellosen“ Veränderungen in den Wettermustern der Welt geführt hat. Robert Scribbler und der Forscher Paul Beckwith von der University of Ottawa warnten vor den „wetterdestabilisierenden und extremwettererzeugenden“ Folgen der Jetstream-Verschiebung. Andere Wissenschaftler wiesen ihre Behauptungen jedoch zurück, wobei einer ihre Besorgnis über den Wind, der den Äquator überquert, als „totalen Unsinn“ bezeichnete. Scribbler und Beckwith sagten, dass die Anomalien höchstwahrscheinlich durch den vom Menschen verursachten Klimawandel ausgelöst wurden, der dazu führte, dass der Jetstream langsamer wurde und größere Wellen erzeugte. Scribbler schrieb am Dienstag in einem Beitrag in seinem Umweltblog: „Es ist das Bild des Wetters, das aufgrund des Klimawandels seltsam ist. Etwas, das in einer normalen Welt absolut nicht passieren würde. Etwas, das, wenn es so weitergeht, im Grunde die saisonale Integrität bedroht. Der Blogger erklärte, dass die Barriere zwischen den beiden Jetstreams die starke Kluft zwischen Sommer und Winter erzeugt und der „Tod des Winters“ beginnen könnte, wenn sie erodiert wird, wenn warmes Wetter in die „Winterzone“ des Jahres eindringt.

de2b62d8	Die Rolle der Wälder bei der Bekämpfung des Klimawandels könnte von den Regierungen der Welt übersehen werden, so eine Gruppe von Wissenschaftlern, die davor gewarnt haben, die Entwaldung zu stoppen, sei „genauso dringend“ wie die Beseitigung der Nutzung fossiler Brennstoffe. Die Rodung der Wälder der Welt würde mehr als 3 Billionen Tonnen Kohlendioxid freisetzen, mehr als die Menge, die in identifizierten globalen Reserven an Öl, Kohle und Gas gebunden ist. Durch den Schutz und die Wiederherstellung von Wäldern würde die Welt 18 % der Emissionsminderung erreichen, die bis 2030 erforderlich ist, um einen außer Kontrolle geratenen Klimawandel zu vermeiden, sagte die Gruppe von 40 Wissenschaftlern aus fünf Ländern in einer Erklärung. „Wir müssen gesunde Wälder schützen und erhalten, um einen gefährlichen Klimawandel zu vermeiden und sicherzustellen, dass die Wälder der Welt weiterhin wichtige Dienste für das Wohlergehen des Planeten und uns selbst leisten“, heißt es in der Erklärung. Die Intervention erfolgt, während sich der Zwischenstaatliche Ausschuss der Vereinten Nationen für Klimawandel in Südkorea versammelt, bevor am Montag ein mit Spannung erwarteter Bericht darüber veröffentlicht wird, wie die Welt eine Erwärmung um 1,5 ° C (2,7 ° F) über das vorindustrielle Niveau hinaus vermeiden kann, ein erstrebenswertes Ziel des Meilensteins Pariser Klimaabkommen im Jahr 2015. Es wird erwartet, dass sich der Bericht eher auf die erforderlichen Änderungen des Energiesystems als auf die Wälder konzentrieren wird. „Als Antwort auf den IPCC-Bericht ist unsere Botschaft als Wissenschaftler einfach: Das zukünftige Klima unseres Planeten ist untrennbar mit der Zukunft seiner Wälder verbunden“, schließt die Erklärung der Wissenschaftler. Bäume und andere Pflanzen absorbieren derzeit rund ein Viertel des CO 2 , das der Mensch der Atmosphäre zuführt, und mildern so die potenziellen Auswirkungen des Klimawandels. Während die Welt nicht alle ihre Bäume verlieren wird, gehen im Amazonas, in Zentralafrika und Indonesien immer noch große Teile tropischer Wälder verloren, die eine enorme Menge an Kohlenstoff enthalten. Die Erwärmung der Temperaturen schürt auch riesige Brände in Wäldern in höheren Breiten, wie in diesem Sommer zu sehen war, als ein Großteil Nordschwedens in Flammen stand. „Der Waldteil des Gesprächs geht oft verloren und ich glaube nicht, dass der IPCC-Bericht ihn genug hervorheben wird“, sagte Deborah Lawrence, Professorin für Umweltwissenschaften an der University of Virginia und Unterzeichnerin der Erklärung. „Wir nehmen Wälder fast als gegeben hin, aber wir verlieren jedes Jahr Wald, was bedeutet, dass wir ihn als Kohlenstoffsenke verringern. „Die Entwaldung wurde im Amazonas massiv reduziert, aber anderswo ist das nicht passiert. Wenn die Länder in Afrika friedlicher werden, könnten wir mehr tropische Wälder verlieren, was mich wirklich beunruhigt.“ Es wird erwartet, dass der IPCC-Bericht die Notwendigkeit einer noch nicht erprobten Technologie erwähnt, um die Vegetation zu verbrennen und die resultierenden Emissionen unterirdisch zu vergraben oder Kohlenstoff direkt aus der Luft zu saugen, um das 1,5-C-Ziel zu erreichen. Die Erklärung von Lawrence und anderen Wissenschaftlern warnt davor, dass die frühere Strategie, die als Bioenergie mit Kohlenstoffabscheidung und -speicherung (Beccs) bekannt ist, ungetestet ist und riskiert, riesige Regenwaldgebiete auszulöschen, um Platz für Plantagenholz zur Energiegewinnung zu machen. „Es bricht mir das Herz, daran zu denken, dass wir die Hälfte unserer tropischen Wälder für Plantagen verlieren würden, nur um uns selbst zu retten“, sagte Lawrence. „Es ist erschreckend, dass wir unsere Biodiversität verlieren, um den Klimawandel abzuwenden. Der Verlust von Tropenwäldern ist keineswegs billiger als der Bau von Windparks in den USA oder in der Sahara.“ Lawrence sagte, ein steiler Rückgang der Emissionen auf null bis 2040 würde die Notwendigkeit einer Technologie für „negative Emissionen“ zunichte machen, die die Fähigkeit der Wälder beeinträchtigen würde, Kohlenstoff zu absorbieren, die lokale Wasserversorgung und Wetterbedingungen aufrechtzuerhalten und ein Zuhause für einen Aufruhr von Vögeln und Säugetieren zu bieten , Insekten und andere Lebewesen. „Ohne diese Wälder werden wir eine heißere und trockenere Welt haben“, sagte Lawrence. „Es braucht einen internationalen CO2-Preis, um den Schutz der Wälder zu finanzieren. Und Länder mit Tropenwäldern sollten große Waldstücke erhalten, um die Niederschläge für die Landwirtschaft zu stabilisieren und ein vorhersehbares regionales Klima aufrechtzuerhalten.“ Die Aussichten, eine Erwärmung um mindestens 1,5 °C abzuwenden, scheinen jedoch gering, da ein Co-Autor des bevorstehenden IPCC-Berichts letzte Woche warnte, dass die Welt „bei weitem nicht auf dem richtigen Weg“ sei, um ihre Verpflichtungen von Paris zu erfüllen.

Bitte sehen Sie sich den Zeitstempel der Geschichte an, um zu sehen, wann sie zuletzt aktualisiert wurde. Die NASA hat dieses Video mit folgender Beschreibung auf YouTube gepostet: „Das arktische Meereis ist in den letzten Jahren nicht nur in seiner Oberfläche geschrumpft, es wird auch jünger und dünner. In dieser Animation, in der die Eisdecke fast gallertartig aussieht, während sie durch die Jahreszeiten pulsiert, beschreibt der Kryosphärenwissenschaftler Dr. Walt Meier vom Goddard Space Flight Center der NASA, wie das Meereis während der Ära der Satellitenmessungen grundlegende Veränderungen erfahren hat.“ 2017 war erneut eines der heißesten Jahre seit Beginn der Wetteraufzeichnungen und wurde von der NASA als das zweitwärmste und von der National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration als drittwärmste eingestuft. Die Ergebnisse „setzen den langfristigen Erwärmungstrend des Planeten fort“, so die NASA. Ein Trend, der überwiegend durch menschliche Aktivitäten durch Kohlendioxidemissionen getrieben wird. Temperaturaufzeichnungen für den Planeten, die von beiden Behörden unabhängig voneinander überwacht werden, reichen bis ins Jahr 1880 zurück. Die Ankündigung erfolgte auf einer gemeinsamen Pressekonferenz am Donnerstag in Washington. Das heißeste Jahr seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen bleibt 2016, während 2015 laut NOAA auf Platz zwei und von NASA auf Platz drei liegt, was bedeutet, dass die drei besten Jahre die jüngsten drei waren. Obwohl 2017 im Vergleich zu 2016 im Durchschnitt etwas kühler war, war der Trend zu einem wärmeren Planeten noch nie so deutlich. Die sechs heißesten Jahre sind alle seit 2010 aufgetreten, und 17 der 18 heißesten Jahre seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen sind seit 2001 aufgetreten. Laut NASA lag die globale Durchschnittstemperatur von Land und Ozean 0,9 °C (1,62 °F) über dem Durchschnitt des 20. Jahrhunderts . Damit liegen wir weit über der Hälfte des ehrgeizigen Ziels, die Erwärmung auf 1,5 °C (2,7 °F) zu begrenzen, das im Pariser Klimaabkommen von 2016 festgelegt wurde. Wissenschaftler sind der Ansicht, dass, um eine Überschreitung dieses Grenzwerts zu vermeiden, die CO2-Emissionen ab sofort erheblich reduziert werden müssten. La Niña reicht nicht aus, um uns abzukühlen Der leichte Rückgang der Temperaturen in diesem Jahr lässt sich teilweise durch die Präsenz von La Niña erklären, die Ende 2016 begann, bis ins Jahr 2017 andauerte und spät im Jahr zurückkehrte – während ein robuster El Niño vorhanden war während Teilen der Jahre 2015 und 2016. El Niño ist durch eine Erwärmung der Oberflächengewässer im tropischen Pazifik gekennzeichnet – was dazu neigt, die globalen Temperaturen in die Höhe zu treiben. Daher sind Jahre mit El Niños global tendenziell wärmer als andere Jahre. La Niñas hingegen weisen im Pazifik kühleres Wasser auf als der Durchschnitt und neigen dazu, den Planeten abzukühlen. Die Tatsache, dass 2017 das zweit- oder drittwärmste Jahr seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen war, trotz der Anwesenheit eines sich abkühlenden La Niña, spricht für den allgemeinen Erwärmungstrend, den die Erde dank der globalen Erwärmung insgesamt erlebt. Laut NASA wäre 2017 das wärmste Jahr seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen gewesen, wenn „die Auswirkungen der jüngsten El Niño- und La Niña-Muster statistisch aus der Aufzeichnung entfernt worden wären“. Globale Klima-Highlights 2017 Das Meereis setzte seinen rückläufigen Trend fort, sowohl in der Arktis als auch in der Antarktis. Die Antarktis, die noch vor wenigen Jahren auf Rekordniveau tendierte, erreichte 2017 ein Rekordtief, wobei das Eis 154.000 Quadratmeilen weniger bedeckte als das vorherige Rekordtief von 1986. In der Arktis war die Meereisausdehnung die zweitgrößte. niedrigste seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen im Jahr 1979, nur hinter 2016, obwohl in den Wintermonaten Januar bis März ein Rekordtief des Meereises beobachtet wurde. Temperaturen, die auf der ganzen Welt deutlich wärmer als normal waren, bedeuteten jedoch nicht, dass es an Schnee mangelte. Laut dem Global Snow Lab der Rutgers University war die durchschnittliche Ausdehnung der Schneedecke auf der Nordhalbkugel die größte seit 1985 und die achtgrößte seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen im Jahr 1968. 2017 war auch geprägt von einer Reihe extremer Wetterereignisse, insbesondere der Rekordzahl schwerer Hurrikane, die die USA und die Karibik heimsuchten, was zum teuersten Jahr für Wetterkatastrophen in der Geschichte der USA führte.

ba39a59d	Der linksextreme ThinkProgress berichtet, dass Wissenschaftler endlich bewiesen haben, dass die Theorie der menschengemachten globalen Erwärmung ein totaler Schwindel ist. Natürlich wird es niemand zugeben, aber genau das ist passiert. Eine neue wissenschaftliche Studie zeigt Folgendes: Aktuelle CO2-Werte von 410 Teilen pro Million (ppm) wurden zuletzt vor drei Millionen Jahren auf der Erde gesehen, so die detaillierteste Rekonstruktion des Erdklimas von Forschern des Potsdam-Instituts für Klimafolgen Research (PIK) und veröffentlicht in Science Advances. Ja, Sie haben richtig gelesen, vor drei Millionen – Millionen – Jahren war der CO2-Gehalt auf der Erde derselbe wie heute, aber es gibt einen großen Unterschied zwischen vor drei Millionen Jahren und heute … Vor drei Millionen Jahren fuhren wir Menschen nicht Auto Autos oder das Essen des Fleisches, das Kuhfürze erfordert; wir haben nicht gegrillt oder uns geweigert, zu recyceln oder Fabriken zu bauen; es gab kein Industriezeitalter, kein Plastik, keine Klimaanlage, keine Elektrizität, keine Sägewerke, keinen Konsum, keine Aerosole. Tatsächlich gab es vor drei Millionen Jahren wahrscheinlich keine Menschen auf der Erde, zumindest keine Menschen in der Art, wie wir diesen Begriff heute verwenden. Und doch… CO2-Werte waren damals die gleichen wie heute… Hmmm…? Aber ich dachte, die Menschen hätten den Planeten erwärmt? Das ist die Hektik, die uns seit drei Jahrzehnten verkauft wird – Sie wissen, dass WIR das Problem sind. Uns wurde auch gesagt, dass das Problem DEFINITIV NICHT ein Milliarden Jahre alter Planet ist, der Zyklen durchläuft, in denen die Temperatur ein wenig schwanken könnte. Oh nein, das könnte es nie sein – also hör auf zu sagen, dass es das sein könnte, du Denier. Nun, was ist mit der Eiszeit, die Tausende und Abertausende von Jahren vor dem Industriezeitalter stattfand? Halt die Klappe, Denier. Und doch … Laut der Studie entdeckten Wissenschaftler auch, dass während dieser Zeit der globalen Erwärmung „weder Grönland noch die Westantarktis von Eisschilden bedeckt waren und ein Großteil des ostantarktischen Eisschilds verschwunden war“. Wie ist das möglich, 2.999.971 Jahre bevor Arnold Schwarzenegger seinen Hummer kaufte? Es kommt noch schlimmer: Die Temperaturen waren weltweit bis zu 7 Grad Fahrenheit wärmer, mindestens doppelt so hoch wie an den Polen, und der Meeresspiegel war etwa 20 Meter (65 Fuß) höher. Wie ist das möglich, 2.999.945 Jahre bevor die Amerikaner in die Vororte zogen und die Holzkohlegrills anzündeten? Selbst angesichts einer Studie, die das gesamte Konzept der menschengemachten globalen Erwärmung völlig entlarvt, hält ThinkProgress natürlich an diesem Schwindel fest, muss aber auch Folgendes zugeben: Die gute Nachricht ist, dass sich die Erde nicht sofort erwärmt, und Kilometerdicke Eisschilde schmelzen noch langsamer. Der Temperaturanstieg wird also mehrere Jahrzehnte dauern, und der Anstieg des Meeresspiegels um mehrere zehn Meter wird Hunderte und Aberhunderte von Jahren dauern. Aber-aber-aber Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy hat mir gesagt, wir haben nur 12 Jahre! Und dann wirft ThinkProgress diese Anti-Wissenschafts-Stinkbombe ab: Das bedeutet, dass die Entscheidungen, die wir jetzt treffen, die Anstiegsrate beeinflussen und bestimmen können, ob wir den Anstieg des Meeresspiegels über 65 Fuß auf über 200 Fuß sprengen. Weil, weil, weil Orange Man Bad: Schlimmer noch, die klimapolitische Agenda, die Präsident Donald Trump vorantreibt – Maßnahmen, die die Rücknahme von US-Gesetzen zur Verringerung der Kohlenstoffverschmutzung und die Aufgabe des Pariser Klimaabkommens beinhalten – uns an so hohe CO2-Werte binden würden, Der Meeresspiegel würde in nur wenigen Jahrzehnten um einen Fuß pro Jahrzehnt steigen. Nein, eigentlich beweist diese Studie, dass wir nichts tun können, um die natürlichen Klimazyklen der Erde zu stoppen. Selbst die Schlimmsten der Schlimmsten, selbst die Wahnsinnigsten, die den Global Warming Hoax vorantreiben, geben zu, dass wir den Planeten bestenfalls nur um ein paar Grad abkühlen können, was so gut wie nichts bringt, wenn der Planet entschlossen ist, sich um sieben wieder zu erwärmen Grad, wie wir heute wissen, vor 2.999.998 Jahren, bevor der Bad Orange Man ein paar Pipelines genehmigte.

4854c659	„Globale Erwärmung“ ist ein Mythos – so sagen es 80 Grafiken aus 58 von Experten begutachteten wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten, die 2017 veröffentlicht wurden. Mit anderen Worten, der sogenannte „Konsens“ zur globalen Erwärmung ist eine massive Lüge. Und Donald Trump hatte völlig Recht, das Pariser Abkommen zu kündigen, das vorgab, dass die massive Lüge wahr sei. Mit „globaler Erwärmung“ meinen diese Papiere natürlich nicht die milde Erwärmung um etwa 0,8 Grad Celsius, die der Planet seit Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts erlebt hat, als die Welt aus der Kleinen Eiszeit gekrochen ist. Darin sind sich so ziemlich alle einig, Alarmisten und Skeptiker gleichermaßen. Vielmehr meinen sie „globale Erwärmung“ in dem Sinne, der heute am häufigsten von geldgebenden Wissenschaftlern, Huxter-Politikern, angstmachenden grünen Aktivisten und gehirngewaschenen Umweltkorrespondenten der Mainstream-Medien (MSM) verwendet wird. „Globale Erwärmung“ wie in dem beängstigenden, historisch beispiellosen, hauptsächlich vom Menschen verursachten Phänomen, das wir dringend angehen müssen, bevor die Eiskappen schmelzen und die pazifischen Inseln unter den Wellen verschwinden und alle Eisbärenbabys ertrinken. Was all diese Papiere auf ihre unterschiedliche Weise argumentieren, ist, dass die alarmistische Version der globalen Erwärmung – auch bekannt als katastrophale anthropogene globale Erwärmung (CAGW) – ein gefälschtes Artefakt ist. Das heißt, all diese verschiedenen Experten aus der ganzen Welt – China, Russland, Kanada, die USA, Italien usw. – haben sich verschiedene Aspekte des Puzzles der globalen Erwärmung in verschiedenen Regionen und auf verschiedenen Zeitskalen genau angesehen und sind zu dem Schluss gekommen in tadelloser, von Experten begutachteter wissenschaftlicher Weise, dass es keine Beweise gibt, die die Schreckensgeschichte der globalen Erwärmung stützen. Sie zeigen, dass die globale Erwärmung Ende des 20. und Anfang des 21. Jahrhunderts weder dramatisch noch ungewöhnlich noch beängstigend ist. Hier, wie von Kenneth Richard bei No Tricks Zone zusammengestellt, sind nur einige der Diagramme, die dies beweisen. Büntgen et al., unten, zeigen, dass die Temperaturen in der nördlichen Hemisphäre in den frühen 1400er Jahren wärmer waren als heute Die Erwärmungszeit war wärmer als alles, was wir in unserer eigenen Ära erlebt haben. Hier ist eine von Li et al., die zeigt, dass es in China vor 8.000 Jahren viel wärmer war. Hier ist eine ungewöhnliche von Guillet et al., die darauf hindeutet, dass es nichts Neues über extrem frühe oder späte Weinlesen im Laufe der Jahrhunderte gibt: Und es geht weiter und weiter – es gibt 80 Grafiken Alles in allem zeigt jedes auf seine unterschiedliche Weise, warum die Angst vor der globalen Erwärmung schrecklich übertrieben wurde, weil die Beweise einfach nicht dafür sprechen, dass sie ungewöhnlich oder ein Problem sind. Mehrere der Veröffentlichungen stellen fest, dass der primäre Einfluss auf die Erwärmung die Sonnenaktivität zu sein scheint. Nur wenige, wenn überhaupt, haben die Vorstellung, dass der Kohlendioxidgehalt viel damit zu tun hat. Das intellektuell korrupte und verlogene alarmistische Wissenschafts-Establishment – ​​ich denke zum Beispiel an meinen persönlichen Bete Noir, den linken politischen Aktivisten und Nobelpreisträger für Genetik Sir Paul Nurse, ehemaligen Präsidenten der Royal Society – will uns das glauben machen Klimaskeptizismus ist eine Minderheitsaktivität, die Domäne einiger Spinner, die nur von Leuten verfochten wird, die keine Wissenschaft betreiben. Aber das ist nur hässliche Propaganda. Hier sind Dutzende von angesehenen Wissenschaftlern aus der ganzen Welt, die ohne Wenn und Aber an Studien zusammenarbeiten, die alle unabhängig und rigoros die zunehmend respektable Ansicht bestätigen, dass die „menschengemachte globale Erwärmung“ einfach keine Sache ist. Nicht, dass es wirklich jemals etwas gewesen wäre. Diese Debatte – wie ich ausführlich in Watermelons argumentiere – drehte sich immer um linke Ideologie, quasi-religiöse Hysterie und „Folge-dem-Geld“-Korruption, niemals um „Wissenschaft“. Trotzdem ist es immer beruhigend zu wissen, dass „die Wissenschaft“ auch auf unserer Seite ist. Sie hassen diese Tatsache so sehr, die Greenies.

da8075a2	"Mehr als 3 Milliarden Menschen könnten in den nächsten 50 Jahren möglicherweise in unerträglicher Hitze leben, wie eine neue Studie zeigt, die in den Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika veröffentlicht wurde. Während das Worst-Case-Szenario besagt, dass 3 Milliarden Menschen betroffen sein könnten, berichtete Associated Press, dass die wahrscheinlicheren Szenarien aus der Studie zeigen, dass mindestens eine Milliarde Menschen betroffen sein werden. Die Anzahl der betroffenen Personen hängt davon ab, welche Maßnahmen ergriffen werden, um die CO2-Emissionen zu reduzieren. Derzeit sind 20 Millionen Menschen von extrem hohen Temperaturen betroffen. Besuchen Sie die Homepage von Business Insider für weitere Geschichten. Laut einer neuen Studie, die in den Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America veröffentlicht wurde, könnte bis 2070 bis zu die Hälfte der heutigen Weltbevölkerung mit „unbewohnbarer Hitze“ zu kämpfen haben. Laut der Studie werden in den nächsten 50 Jahren voraussichtlich zwischen 1 und 3 Milliarden Menschen unerträglicher Hitze ausgesetzt sein. Bis 2070 könnte das etwa ein Drittel der damaligen Weltbevölkerung sein. Marten Scheffer von der Universität Wageningen in den Niederlanden, Ökologe und Co-Autor der Studie, sagte der Associated Press, die Projektionen seien „unerträglich für den Normalbürger, für arme Menschen, für den durchschnittlichen Weltbürger“. Die tatsächliche Zahl der betroffenen Menschen wird davon abhängen, wie schnell die Weltbevölkerung wächst und wie hoch die CO2-Emissionen sind, berichtete der AP. Während das Worst-Case-Szenario davon ausgeht, dass über 3 Milliarden Menschen betroffen sein werden, zeigen wahrscheinlichere Szenarien aus der Studie, dass mindestens 1 Milliarde Menschen betroffen sein werden, berichtete der AP. ""Es ist eine riesige Menge, und es ist eine kurze Zeit. Deshalb sind wir besorgt"", sagte die Klimawissenschaftlerin der Cornell University, Natalie Mahowald, gegenüber AP. Mahowald war nicht an der Studie beteiligt, sagte aber gegenüber AP, dass „die neue Studie Sinn macht und die Dringlichkeit des menschengemachten Klimawandels anders vermittelt als frühere Forschungen“. Scheffer sagte dem AP, dass für jeden Anstieg der globalen Jahresdurchschnittstemperatur um 1,8 Grad Fahrenheit „durch den menschengemachten Klimawandel“ etwa eine Milliarde Menschen in Gebieten landen werden, die zu warm zum Leben sind. Treibhausgasemissionen müssen reduziert werden, damit die durchschnittlichen Jahrestemperaturen nicht über den Jahresdurchschnitt von etwa 52 bis 59 Grad Fahrenheit steigen, in dem Menschen in den letzten 6.000 Jahren gedeihen konnten, berichtete USA Today. „Wir zeigen, dass sich in einem Business-as-usual-Klimawandelszenario die geografische Position dieser Temperaturnische in den kommenden 50 Jahren voraussichtlich mehr verschieben wird, als sie sich (in den letzten 6.000 Jahren) bewegt hat“, heißt es in der Studie. Die AP berichtete, dass das Verbreitungsgebiet gefunden wurde, nachdem Wissenschaftler „Menschen wie Bären, Vögel und Bienen betrachteten, um die ‚Klimanische‘ zu finden, in der Menschen und Zivilisationen gedeihen“. Während Menschen bei heißem und kälterem Wetter leben können, ist es umso schwieriger, je weiter von diesem Bereich entfernt ist. Die Forscher untersuchten Gebiete, in denen die Reichweitenveränderung am wahrscheinlichsten ist, und schätzten, dass dort in den nächsten 50 Jahren etwa 2 Milliarden Menschen leben werden. Die Studie ergab, dass große Teile Afrikas, Asiens, Südamerikas und Australiens wahrscheinlich ihre Temperatur erhöhen werden, ähnlich wie es 20 Millionen Menschen bereits an Orten wie der Sahara erleben, wo die jährliche Durchschnittstemperatur mehr als 84 Grad Fahrenheit beträgt AP berichtet. „Große Gebiete des Planeten würden sich auf ein kaum überlebensfähiges Niveau aufheizen und nicht wieder abkühlen“, sagte Scheffer gegenüber USA Today. „Dies hätte nicht nur verheerende direkte Auswirkungen, sondern lässt die Gesellschaft auch weniger in der Lage, mit zukünftigen Krisen wie neuen Pandemien fertig zu werden. Das einzige, was dies verhindern kann, ist eine rasche Senkung der CO2-Emissionen.“"	3 Milliarden Menschen – bis zu der Hälfte der derzeitigen Weltbevölkerung – könnten in 50 Jahren in unerträglicher Hitze leben	partially false
5c3d8916	Das Great Barrier Reef Warum sich um Riffe kümmern? Mit einem Wort – Biodiversität. Das Riff beherbergt 3.000 Arten von Mollusken, über hundert Quallenarten, 1.625 Fischarten, Hunderte von Hai- und Rochenarten und über 30 Arten von Walen und Delfinen. Diese Meeresbewohner nennen die Weich- und Hartkorallen, aus denen das Riff besteht, „Zuhause“. Und ohne sie werden viele von ihnen sterben. Wenn das nicht genug ist, hat es die Auszeichnung, die größte lebende Struktur auf dem Planeten zu sein. Das Great Barrier Reef beherbergt 3.000 einzelne Korallenriffe, die sich über eine atemberaubende Länge von 2.575 Kilometern (1.600 Meilen) erstrecken und eine Fläche von etwa 344.400 Quadratkilometern (133.000 Quadratmeilen) bedecken. Unglücklicherweise, aufgrund von aufeinanderfolgenden Massenbleichereignissen, sagen Wissenschaftler uns, dass sich das massive, beeindruckende australische Great Barrier Reef jetzt in einem „Endstadium“ befindet – mit großen Teilen, die keine Hoffnung auf Erholung haben. Massenbleiche, ein Phänomen, das durch die globale Erwärmung verursacht wird, wird ausgelöst, wenn sich das Wasser so weit erwärmt, dass Korallen beginnen, die symbiotischen Algen in ihrem Gewebe auszustoßen, die für ihr Überleben unerlässlich sind. Im Laufe der Geschichte gab es nur vier Fälle dieses Vorfalls, und nach einem solchen Ereignis wird es Jahrzehnte dauern, bis er sich erholt hat. „Dies ist das vierte Mal, dass das Great Barrier Reef stark gebleicht wurde – in den Jahren 1998, 2002, 2016 und jetzt im Jahr 2017. Gebleichte Korallen sind nicht unbedingt tote Korallen, aber in der schweren zentralen Region erwarten wir einen hohen Korallenverlust“, sagte er Forscher James Kerry vom ARC Center of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies der James Cook University in einer offiziellen Erklärung. Er stellt klar, warum die Bleiche von 2017 von Bedeutung ist: „Es dauert mindestens ein Jahrzehnt, bis sich selbst die am schnellsten wachsenden Korallen vollständig erholt haben, sodass Massenbleichereignisse im Abstand von 12 Monaten keine Aussicht auf Erholung für Riffe bieten, die 2016 beschädigt wurden.“ Todeszoll Die neuesten Luftaufnahmen umfassten über 8.000 Kilometer (5.000) Meilen, darunter 800 einzelne Korallenriffe. 1.500 Kilometer (932 Meilen) des Great Barrier Reef sind den Erhebungen zufolge inzwischen ausgebleicht. Diese neuen Statistiken kommen weniger als ein Jahr, nachdem 93 Prozent des Riffs schwere Schäden erlitten haben, wobei Berichte hinzufügen, dass sich die Auswirkungen auch weiter nach Süden ausgebreitet haben. In Kombination mit dem Massenbleichereignis trug die Ankunft des tropischen Wirbelsturms Debbie zu der Verwüstung bei, als er einen Teil des Riffs traf, der es schaffte, der schlimmsten Bleiche zu entkommen. In einem Interview mit The Guardian stellen Wissenschaftler fest, wie schlimm die Situation ist. „Wir haben aufgegeben“, sagte Jon Brodie, Wasserqualitätsexperte der James Cook University, der sich auf die Untätigkeit der australischen Regierung bezog. „Es war mein Leben, die Wasserqualität zu managen, wir haben versagt.“ Leider werden die Temperaturen in diesem Zeitalter der globalen Erwärmung voraussichtlich weiter steigen, was bedeutet, dass mehr dieser Bleichereignisse auftreten und noch mehr Schaden anrichten werden. Und die Realität ist, dass dies die letzte Generation sein könnte, die die großartige Schönheit dieses Riffs sehen wird.

43daeaa5	Die jüngste Dürre hat den Druck deutlich gemacht, den ein sich änderndes Klima auf ein schneedeckenabhängiges Wassersystem ausübt. Mit der Verlagerung hin zu mehr Regen statt Schnee und dem früheren Schmelzen der Schneedecke müssen Wassermanager häufiger Wasser für den Hochwasserschutz freisetzen. Diese Dynamik spielt sich jetzt in Oroville ab, wo die Wassermanager des Staates versuchen, das Wasser aus dem Reservoir des Damms zu entleeren, bevor am Mittwoch Stürme erwartet werden. Da diese Stürme relativ warm sind, bringen sie wahrscheinlich Regen in die umliegenden Berge und beschleunigen den Wasserfluss hinter dem Damm. Die Gegenüberstellung von fünf Jahren heißer, trockener Bedingungen, gefolgt von mehr Regen, als Stauseen speichern können, mag unpassend erscheinen. Genau das haben Klimawissenschaftler jedoch mindestens seit den 1980er Jahren für Kalifornien vorhergesagt: lang anhaltende Perioden mit warmen, trockenen Bedingungen, unterbrochen von intensiven Nässeperioden mit mehr Regen und weniger Schnee, die sowohl Dürren als auch Überschwemmungen verursachen. Jüngste Arbeiten aus meinem Labor zeigen, dass sich dieses Muster tatsächlich bereits abzeichnet, wobei die Bedingungen, die sowohl extrem warme, trockene Jahre als auch extrem nasse Jahre hervorrufen, häufiger werden. Die andere bittere Realität ist, dass dieser extrem nasse Winter die Dürre nicht wegspülen wird. Kalifornien hat von 2012 bis 2016 je nach Blickwinkel ein bis drei volle Niederschlagsjahre verloren. Das ist eine Menge Wasser, das in einem Jahr wieder aufgeholt werden muss, und fast die Hälfte Kaliforniens befand sich letzte Woche noch in einem Dürrezustand . Die Feuchtigkeitsdefizite, die sich während der Dürre angesammelt haben, haben wir zu unseren Lebzeiten nicht gesehen. Sie haben dazu geführt, dass Tausende von Einwohnern Kaliforniens ohne fließendes Wasser auskommen, Grundwasser verunreinigt und die Speicherkapazität der Grundwasserleiter dauerhaft verloren haben und zig Millionen Bäume stark gestresst sind. Infolgedessen werden ländliche Gemeinden, Grundwasserleiter und Waldökosysteme auch nach diesem nassen Jahr noch die Auswirkungen der Dürre spüren. Wie die letzten fünf Jahre zeigen, ist Kaliforniens Wassersystem nicht für die „neue Normalität“ des Klimawandels gerüstet. Dieses Wassersystem muss gleichzeitig die größte Bevölkerung und den landwirtschaftlichen Sektor des Landes und eine seiner vielfältigsten natürlichen Umgebungen versorgen. Obwohl Kalifornien die Wassernutzungseffizienz im letzten halben Jahrhundert stark verbessert hat, bringt der Klimawandel unser Wassersystem an seine Grenzen. Investitionen in „klimaintelligente“ Infrastruktur können die Sicherheit der Amerikaner angesichts der Klimabelastungen jetzt und in Zukunft gewährleisten. Diese Investitionen in die Modernisierung und den Ausbau der Infrastruktur würden Arbeitsplätze schaffen, Gemeinden vor Katastrophen schützen und dazu beitragen, uns auf Klimaveränderungen vorzubereiten. Diese Bemühungen hätten mehrere Schlüsselelemente: Erstens müssen wir angesichts der neuen Klimanormalität, in der lang anhaltende heiße Trockenperioden weitaus häufiger sind, Technologien einsetzen, die die Wasserversorgung erhöhen können. Während teuren, energieintensiven Entsalzungsoptionen große Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt wurde, haben sich die Abwasserrecyclingtechnologien so weit verbessert, dass sauberes, sicheres Wasser jetzt zu reduzierten Energiekosten geliefert werden kann und sogar als Energiequelle dienen kann, indem die organischen Stoffe im Abwasser zur Produktion verwendet werden Energie. Investitionen in die Infrastruktur zum Auffangen, Speichern und Reinigen von städtischem Regenwasser werden auch neue Wasserversorgungsquellen schaffen.

830085e7	"Die globale Erwärmung könnte viel schlimmer sein als vorhergesagt, neue Studie legt nahe, dass die Temperaturen in den USA in den letzten drei Jahrzehnten gestiegen sind In den letzten 30 Jahren sind die Temperaturen in den Vereinigten Staaten um 1,6 Grad Fahrenheit gestiegen. In Salida, Colorado, haben die Bewohner die Veränderung durch mehr Rasenbewässerung, gestiegene Verkäufe von Klimaanlagen und größere Brände bemerkt. (18. Juni) AP Kollabierende Polkappen, eine grüne Sahara, ein Anstieg des Meeresspiegels um 20 Fuß. Das ist die potenzielle Zukunft der Erde, schlägt eine neue Studie vor und stellt fest, dass die globale Erwärmung doppelt so warm sein könnte, wie aktuelle Klimamodelle vorhersagen. Bemerkenswert ist auch die Erwärmungsrate: „Die Veränderungen, die wir heute sehen, sind viel schneller als alles andere in der Erdgeschichte. In Bezug auf die Änderungsrate befinden wir uns in unbekannten Gewässern“, sagte die Co-Autorin der Studie, Katrin Meissner von der University of New South Wales in Australien. Dies könnte bedeuten, dass das wegweisende Pariser Klimaabkommen – das die globale Erwärmung auf 2 Grad Celsius (3,6 Grad Fahrenheit) über dem vorindustriellen Niveau begrenzen soll – möglicherweise nicht ausreicht, um eine Katastrophe abzuwenden. „Selbst bei einer Erwärmung von nur 2 Grad – und möglicherweise nur 1,5 Grad – sind erhebliche Auswirkungen auf das Erdsystem tiefgreifend“, sagte der Co-Autor der Studie, Alan Mix, ein Wissenschaftler der Oregon State University. „Wir können davon ausgehen, dass der Anstieg des Meeresspiegels für Jahrtausende unaufhaltsam werden und einen Großteil der Weltbevölkerung, der Infrastruktur und der Wirtschaftstätigkeit beeinträchtigen könnte“, sagte Mix. Wenn Wissenschaftler die Vergangenheit der Erde betrachten, können sie vorhersagen, wie die Zukunft aussehen wird. In der Studie blickten die Forscher auf natürliche globale Erwärmungsperioden der letzten 3,5 Millionen Jahre zurück und verglichen sie mit der aktuellen menschengemachten Erwärmung. Durch die Kombination einer breiten Palette von Messungen aus Eisbohrkernen, Sedimentschichten, Fossilien, Datierungen mit atomaren Isotopen und vielen anderen etablierten Paläoklimamethoden setzten die Forscher die Auswirkungen dieser klimatischen Veränderungen zusammen. Der vom Menschen verursachte Klimawandel wird durch die Verbrennung fossiler Brennstoffe wie Kohle, Öl und Gas verursacht, die wärmespeichernde Treibhausgase wie Kohlendioxid und Methan in die Atmosphäre freisetzen. Der Hauptautor der Studie, Hubertus Fischer von der Universität Bern in der Schweiz, und sein Team fanden heraus, dass unsere aktuellen Klimavorhersagen die langfristige Erwärmung möglicherweise um den Faktor zwei unterschätzen. Meissner sagte, dass „Klimamodelle für kleine Änderungen vertrauenswürdig zu sein scheinen, wie etwa für Niedrigemissionsszenarien über kurze Zeiträume, sagen wir über die nächsten paar Jahrzehnte bis 2100. Aber wenn die Änderung größer oder anhaltender wird … scheint es so den Klimawandel unterschätzen."" Die Forschung deckte auch auf, wie große Bereiche der polaren Eiskappen zusammenbrechen könnten und signifikante Veränderungen der Ökosysteme dazu führen könnten, dass die Sahara grün wird und die Ränder tropischer Wälder sich in feuerdominierte Savanne verwandeln. Meissner sagte jedoch: ""Wir können nicht kommentieren, wie weit in der Zukunft diese Änderungen eintreten werden."" In Bezug auf die Studienergebnisse sagte Hauptautor Fischer, dass es ohne eine ernsthafte Reduzierung der Kohlendioxidemissionen „sehr wenig Spielraum für Fehler gibt, um die Pariser Ziele zu erreichen“. Die Studie, die von Dutzenden von Forschern aus 17 Ländern durchgeführt wurde, wurde letzte Woche in Nature Geoscience, einer von Experten begutachteten britischen Zeitschrift, veröffentlicht."

82e146cc	Es ist wirklich schwer zu übertreiben, wie verkorkst Florida ist, wenn es um den Klimawandel geht. Der Anstieg des Meeresspiegels hat bereits dafür gesorgt, dass Überschwemmungen üblich werden und keine Wetterextreme; es garantiert, dass Hurrikane und die damit verbundenen Sturmfluten immer stärker werden. Trotz all dieser Beweise werden Gouverneure und Senatoren, die oft Klimawandelleugner sind, dort immer noch an die Macht zurückgewählt. Anstatt in Maßnahmen zur Verhinderung des Klimawandels zu investieren, werden die Straßen in Miami buchstäblich aus dem Boden gehoben, um das Eindringen von Hochwasser zu stoppen. Eine neue Studie, die in Geophysical Research Letters veröffentlicht wurde, legt nahe, dass sogar diese lächerlich kurzsichtige Maßnahme gewonnen hat nicht ausreichen, um die ankommende Flut zu stoppen. Der Anstieg des Meeresspiegels beschleunigt sich weltweit von Jahr zu Jahr, aber entlang der Küste Floridas steigt er drei- bis sechsmal schneller als der Durchschnitt. Ein Forscherteam der University of Florida berücksichtigte eine Vielzahl von Faktoren, um festzustellen, warum dies geschah. Schließlich sind regionale Änderungen des Meeresspiegelanstiegs sehr komplex, und kein einzelner Mechanismus ist allein dafür verantwortlich. Wenn es um den menschlichen Einfluss geht, gibt es zwei Inputs: das Schmelzen der Eiskappen und die thermische Ausdehnung. Ersteres ist offensichtlich – terrestrisches Eis, das schmilzt, ins Meer fällt und sich auflöst, lässt den Meeresspiegel zuerst in der Region und dann global ansteigen. Letzteres bezieht sich auf das Kohlendioxid in der Atmosphäre; Je mehr es gibt, desto heißer wird die Oberfläche des Planeten und desto heißer werden die Ozeane. Warmes Wasser dehnt sich aus, und normalerweise kann es sich nur nach oben ausdehnen. Wenn es um natürliche Zyklen geht, treten Änderungen des Meeresspiegels normalerweise in kurzen Zeitskalen auf, weil sich eine Meeresströmung, eine Strömung, die Wasser von Ort zu Ort bewegt, geändert hat. El Niño, das epische und allumfassende Klimaphänomen, das alle 2-7 Jahre auftritt, kann diese Meeresströmungen beeinflussen. Diese neue Studie legt nahe, dass der „Hot Spot“ des Anstiegs des Meeresspiegels in Florida hauptsächlich durch diese natürlichen Faktoren verursacht wird. Ein kürzlich aufgetretener, besonders starker El Niño und eine plötzliche Abschwächung des atmosphärischen Drucks über der Region – dank einer als Nordatlantische Oszillation bekannten Erscheinung – verschworen sich, um den Wasserstand stark ansteigen zu lassen. „Die Überlagerung dieser beiden ozean-atmosphärischen Prozesse erklärt 87 % der Varianz im raumzeitlichen Muster der intertradecadalen Meeresspiegelschwankungen“, stellt das Team fest – was bedeutet, dass bei weitem natürliche Prozesse für diesen ungewöhnlichen Hotspot des Meeresspiegelanstiegs verantwortlich sind . Es kann jedoch nicht ignoriert werden, dass der menschliche Beitrag zum Klimawandel diesen nur noch weiter verschärft. Alles in allem sind es schlechte Nachrichten für Floridas nahe Zukunft, die schneller unter Wasser sein wird, als irgendjemand bisher angenommen hat. Eine andere Studie ergab, dass es bis 2100 2 Milliarden Klimaflüchtlinge geben wird – und mehrere Millionen von ihnen werden von Florida ins Landesinnere abwandern.

b509780b	Der Gouverneur von Kalifornien, Jerry Brown, machte den Klimawandel für die Brände in Kalifornien verantwortlich, die den Staat diesen Herbst während eines Besuchs in Ventura County verwüstet haben, um den Schaden zu begutachten. „Das ist die neue Normalität“, sagte er, wie vom Orange County Register zitiert. „Wir sehen uns einer neuen Realität gegenüber, in der Brände das Leben von Menschen, ihr Eigentum und ihre Nachbarschaften bedrohen und Milliarden und Abermilliarden von Dollar kosten. Wir müssen die Ressourcen haben, um die Brände zu bekämpfen, und wir müssen auch in die Bewirtschaftung unserer Vegetation und Wälder investieren und in all die Art und Weise, wie wir an diesem wunderbaren Ort leben – aber einem Ort, der immer heißer wird.“ Klimawissenschaftler sind jedoch skeptischer und weisen darauf hin, dass der Klimawandel einer von vielen Faktoren sein könnte. Ein umfassender Blick auf die Frage von Southern California Public Radio – kaum ein konservativer Sender – ergab, dass es erhebliche Debatten über die Faktoren gab, die die diesjährigen Brände besonders schlimm machten. Ein Faktor waren starke Winde, deren Zusammenhang mit dem Klimawandel „immer noch zur Debatte steht“. Ein weiterer Faktor war die jüngste Dürre des Staates, die in dem Teil Südkaliforniens anhielt, in dem das Thomas-Feuer – jetzt über 150.000 Acres mit nur 15 % Eindämmung – zuschlug. (Ironischerweise führten die starken Regenfälle des letzten Winters dazu, dass das Gestrüpp schnell wuchs und den Bränden viel Brennstoff zum Verbrennen gab.) Ein wichtiger Faktor bei den Bränden der vergangenen Woche war, dass Menschen Häuser in Gebieten bauen, die von Natur aus anfällig für Waldbrände sind oder wo natürlich Trockene Bedingungen bedeuten, dass die Arten von Baumaterialien und Vegetation, die die Menschen in Städten und Vororten bevorzugen, eine Brandgefahr darstellen. Brown hat zuvor häufig den Klimawandel als Ursache für Naturkatastrophen angeführt, nur um von Wissenschaftlern korrigiert zu werden, die behaupteten, er sei der „Korruption aus edlen Gründen“ schuldig – d.h. der Verzerrung der Wissenschaft im Dienste einer Sache, die viele Wissenschaftler unterstützen. Im vergangenen Jahr haben sowohl Brown als auch der damalige Präsident Barack Obama Waldbrände im Westen der Vereinigten Staaten fälschlicherweise mit dem Klimawandel in Verbindung gebracht. Und letzten Monat sagte Brown auf einer Konferenz im Vatikan, dass die Welt eine „Gehirnwäsche“ zum Klimawandel brauche. Abgesehen vom Thomas-Feuer haben die Feuerwehrleute erhebliche Fortschritte in ihrem Kampf gegen einige der anderen Brände gemacht, die in der Region lodern. Das Skirball-Feuer in der Nähe des Freeway 405, das am Donnerstag den Verkehr in Los Angeles zum Erliegen brachte, war laut Southern California Public Radio am Samstagnachmittag zu 75 Prozent eingedämmt. Das Lilac-Feuer, das am Donnerstag mehrere Dutzend Pferde tötete, war laut Register am Samstagabend vollständig eingedämmt. „Das Creek-Feuer war jetzt zu 80 % und das Rye-Feuer zu 65 % eingedämmt“, berichtete die Los Angeles Times am Samstag. Beamte sagen, dass es im Zusammenhang mit den Bränden in Südkalifornien keine Todesfälle gegeben hat. Joel B. Pollak ist Senior Editor-at-Large bei Breitbart News.

d17185d3	Wie was? Helen Harwatt ist eine in Umwelternährung ausgebildete Forscherin, ein Bereich, der sich auf die Entwicklung von Ernährungssystemen konzentriert, die die menschliche Gesundheit und Nachhaltigkeit in Einklang bringen. Sie interessiert sich für Politik, ist aber realistisch, wie viel Fortschritt unter der oben genannten Führung zu erwarten ist. Also haben sie und ihre Kollegen geforscht, wie man die Auswirkungen von Einzelpersonen maximiert. Wie bei so vielen Dingen im Leben und in der Gesundheit kommt es auch hier auf das Essen an. Kürzlich berechneten Harwatt und ein Team von Wissenschaftlern der Oregon State University, des Bard College und der Loma Linda University, was passieren würde, wenn jeder Amerikaner eine Ernährungsumstellung vornehmen würde: Rindfleisch durch Bohnen ersetzen. Sie stellten fest, dass, wenn alle dazu bereit und in der Lage wären – hypothetisch – die USA immer noch nahe daran sein könnten, ihre von Präsident Barack Obama 2009 versprochenen Treibhausgasemissionsziele für 2020 zu erreichen. Das heißt, selbst wenn nichts über unsere Energieinfrastruktur oder Transportsystem änderte – und selbst wenn die Menschen weiterhin Hühnchen und Schweinefleisch und Eier und Käse essen würden – diese eine Ernährungsumstellung könnte irgendwo zwischen 46 und 74 Prozent der Reduktionen erreichen, die erforderlich sind, um das Ziel zu erreichen. „Ich denke, es fehlt wirklich an Bewusstsein dafür, wie viel Einfluss diese Art von Veränderung haben kann“, sagte Harwatt mir. In der Vergangenheit gab es Analysen zu den Umweltauswirkungen von Veganismus und Vegetarismus, aber diese Studie ist neu für die Idee, dass das Engagement einer Person für die Sache nicht vollständig sein muss, um eine Rolle zu spielen. Ein relativ kleiner Ersatz durch eine einzelne Nahrung könnte die stärkste Veränderung sein, die eine Person in Bezug auf ihre lebenslange Umweltbelastung durchführt – mehr als die Verkleinerung des eigenen Autos oder das wachsam sein, Glühbirnen auszuschalten, und sicherlich mehr als das Aufhören zu duschen. Lesen Sie: Die wirtschaftlichen Argumente für weltweiten Vegetarismus Um zu verstehen, warum die Klimaauswirkungen von Rindfleisch allein so groß sind, beachten Sie, dass das Bild am Anfang dieser Geschichte ein Meer von Sojabohnen in einem Silo im brasilianischen Amazonas-Regenwald ist. Die Bohnen gehören zu einem Futterplatz mit 38.000 Rindern, deren Aufzucht und Mast täglich 900 Tonnen Futter ausbringen. Das heißt, dass diese Bohnen von Kühen gefressen werden, und die Kühe werden die Bohnen in Fleisch umwandeln, und die Menschen werden das Fleisch essen. Dabei stoßen die Kühe viel Treibhausgas aus, und sie verbrauchen viel mehr Kalorien in Bohnen, als sie in Fleisch liefern, was bedeutet, dass viel mehr Wälder abgeholzt werden müssen, um Viehfutter anzubauen, als nötig wäre, wenn die oben genannten Bohnen einfach gegessen würden Menschen. Dieser ineffiziente Prozess findet in großem Umfang statt. Brasilien, der weltweit größte Exporteur von rotem Fleisch, hält rund 212 Millionen Rinder. (Im Juni stoppten die USA vorübergehend den Import von Rindfleisch aus Brasilien wegen Abszessen, Eiteransammlungen im Fleisch.) Nach Angaben der Vereinten Nationen werden 33 Prozent des Ackerlandes der Erde für den Anbau von Futtermitteln für Nutztiere verwendet. Mehr noch, 26 Prozent der eisfreien Landoberfläche der Erde werden für Viehweiden genutzt. Insgesamt wird fast ein Drittel der Landfläche der Erde für die Produktion von Fleisch und tierischen Produkten genutzt.	Wenn alle Bohnen statt Rindfleisch essen würden	other

Bildunterschrift anzeigen Bildunterschrift ausblenden Dieses Wetterereignis ist seit 1984 nicht mehr aufgetreten NOAA-Klimawissenschaftler sagen, dass der April 2018 der 400. Monat in Folge auf dem Planeten mit überdurchschnittlichen Temperaturen war. USA HEUTE Es war Dezember 1984 und Präsident Reagan war gerade in seine zweite Amtszeit gewählt worden, Dynasty war die Top-Show im Fernsehen und Madonnas Like a Virgin führte die Musical-Charts an. Es war auch das letzte Mal, dass die Erde einen überdurchschnittlich kühlen Monat hatte. Der vergangene Monat war der 400. Monat in Folge auf dem Planeten mit überdurchschnittlichen Temperaturen, gaben Bundeswissenschaftler der National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration am Donnerstag bekannt. Die Ursache für den Streifen? Zweifellos ist es der Klimawandel, der durch die Verbrennung fossiler Brennstoffe durch die Menschheit verursacht wird. „Wir leben in und teilen eine Welt, die eindeutig, spürbar und folglich wärmer ist als noch vor wenigen Jahrzehnten, und unsere Welt erwärmt sich weiterhin“, sagte NOAA-Klimawissenschaftler Deke Arndt. ""Das Überfahren eines 400er-Schildes unterstreicht das nur, beweist aber nichts Neues."" Klimawissenschaftler verwenden den Durchschnitt des 20. Jahrhunderts als Maßstab für globale Temperaturmessungen. Das liegt daran, dass es zeitlich festgelegt ist und konsistente „Zielpfosten“ bei der Überprüfung von Klimadaten ermöglicht. Es ist auch ein ausreichend langer Zeitraum, um mehrere Zyklen der Klimavariabilität einzuschließen. „Was wirklich zählt, ist, dass wir jeden Monat mehrere Jahrzehnte lang auf der warmen Seite einer vernünftigen Basislinie verbracht haben, unabhängig von der Metrik“, sagte Arndt. Die NOAA-Analyse vom letzten Monat war der drittwärmste April weltweit seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen. Die ungewöhnliche Hitze war am bemerkenswertesten in Europa, das seinen wärmsten April seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen hatte, und in Australien, das seinen zweitwärmsten hatte. Teile Asiens erlebten auch extreme Hitze: In Südpakistan stieg die Stadt Nawabshah am 30. April auf brütende 122,4 Grad, was laut Meteo France möglicherweise die wärmste Apriltemperatur weltweit war. Argentinien hatte auch den wärmsten April seit Beginn der nationalen Aufzeichnungen im Jahr 1961. Nordamerika war der einzige Teil der Welt, der nicht an der Hitzeparade teilnahm. Im vergangenen Monat lag die durchschnittliche US-Temperatur bei 48,9 Grad, 2,2 Grad unter dem Durchschnitt, „was es zum 13. kältesten April seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen und zum kältesten seit 1997 macht“, sagte die NOAA. Mehr: Frühlingsschauer: Der letzte Monat war der kälteste April in den USA seit mehr als 20 Jahren Mehr: Der Kohlendioxidgehalt der Erde steigt weiter an und erreicht den höchsten Stand seit 800.000 Jahren Für das laufende Jahr erlebt die Erde ihren fünftwärmsten Start ins Jahr das Jahr. Eine separate Analyse der globalen Temperaturdaten der NASA, die ebenfalls im vergangenen Monat festgestellt wurde, war der drittwärmste April seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen. Ein weiterer Meilenstein wurde im April erreicht, der ebenfalls mit der Zahl „400“ zusammenhängt: Kohlendioxid – die Gaswissenschaftler sagen, dass es am stärksten für die globale Erwärmung verantwortlich ist – erreichte mit 410 Teilen pro Million den höchsten Stand in der aufgezeichneten Geschichte. Diese Menge ist laut dem Scripps Institute of Oceanography die höchste seit mindestens 800.000 Jahren."	Die Erde hatte gerade ihren 400.

0a68da63	"Australiens Great Barrier Reef hat das schlimmste Korallensterben aller Zeiten Einer der Schätze der Welt, das Great Barrier Reef, litt gerade unter dem schlimmsten jemals verzeichneten Korallensterben, gaben australische Wissenschaftler am Montag bekannt. Rekordsterben von Korallen am Great Barrier Reef Wissenschaftler bestätigen, dass ein Massenbleichereignis am Great Barrier Reef in diesem Jahr mehr Korallen als je zuvor getötet hat, wobei mehr als zwei Drittel in großen Teilen des artenreichen Gebiets zerstört wurden. Video zur Verfügung gestellt von AFP Newslook Stress durch ungewöhnlich warmes Meerwasser, das durch den menschengemachten Klimawandel und das natürliche El Niño-Klimamuster erhitzt wurde, verursachte das Absterben. „Die Koralle wurde gekocht“, sagte Terry Hughes, Direktor des Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, gegenüber der BBC. Mit mehr als 1.400 Meilen Länge ist Australiens Great Barrier Reef das größte Korallenriff der Welt und die größte Struktur des Planeten von lebenden Organismen hergestellt. Im nördlichsten Abschnitt des Riffs, der als der „unberührteste"" galt, starben etwa 67 % der Korallen. Die gute Nachricht, sagten Wissenschaftler, war, dass es dem zentralen und südlichen Abschnitt des Riffs weit besser erging , wobei ""nur"" 6 % bzw. 1 % der Korallen tot. Korallenriffe entstehen durch die Arbeit kleiner Polypen, nur wenige Millimeter großer, übereinander geknospter Lebewesen, deren Schalen sich über Jahrhunderte verbinden um die exotischen Formen von Korallenriffen zu bilden Winzige Unterschiede in der Anatomie jeder Polypenart beeinflussen die Form ihrer Muscheln und erzeugen die exotischen Formen jedes Riffs Die leuchtenden Farben, die Tausende von Touristen an das Great Barrier Reef ea ziehen ch Jahr stammen von Algen, die im Korallengewebe leben. Wenn die Wassertemperatur zu hoch wird, wird die Koralle gestresst und treibt die Algen aus, die der Koralle eine gebleichte weiße Farbe hinterlassen. Die Massenkorallenbleiche ist ein neues Phänomen und wurde nie vor den 1980er Jahren beobachtet, als die globale Erwärmung zunahm. Neben ihrer Schönheit schützen Riffe Land vor Stürmen und sind auch ein Lebensraum für unzählige Arten. ""Korallenriffe sind daher die biologisch vielfältigsten Ökosysteme des Planeten und bieten eine Reihe von Ökosystemleistungen, auf die sich Hunderte Millionen Menschen verlassen"", sagte Greg Torda, ebenfalls vom Zentrum, in einer E-Mail an USA TODAY. „Dazu gehören Versorgung (Fischerei, andere Arten der Ernte, zum Beispiel für Arzneimittel), Küstenschutz, ästhetische und kulturelle Werte – um nur einige zu nennen. Wenn Korallen verloren gehen, gehen auch alle Dienstleistungen verloren, die sie für den Menschen erbringen alle Arten, die direkt oder indirekt auf sie angewiesen sind."" Der Tourismus am Great Barrier Reef beschäftigt 70.000 Menschen und erwirtschaftet jedes Jahr Einnahmen in Höhe von 5 Milliarden US-Dollar (australisch), sagte das Zentrum in einer Erklärung. Die gute Nachricht ist, dass ein Großteil der Korallen dieses Bleichereignis überlebt hat. Aber mit Blick auf die Zukunft wird die Massenkorallenbleiche am Great Barrier Reef wahrscheinlich innerhalb eines Jahrzehnts ein jährliches Phänomen sein, sagte Torda. Wenn alle Korallen auf dem Riff sterben würden, „wäre dies eines der größten Massensterben in der Geschichte“, sagte Torda."

7fe3703e	Doch über seine ersten Ergebnisse hinaus stellt das Papier einen großen Durchbruch für das Gebiet der Klimaökonomie dar. Früher haben die besten Finanzprognosen des Klimawandels die Schäden für das ganze Land auf einmal angenähert. Diese neue Studie arbeitete von unten nach oben und baute ihr Modell aus Dutzenden von mikroökonomischen Studien auf, wie sich der Klimawandel bereits auf die regionale Wirtschaft in den Vereinigten Staaten auswirkt. Jeder Algorithmus im Modell entsteht aus einer zuvor beobachteten Beziehung in realen Daten. „Das ist wie die Erwachsenen, die den Raum betreten. Ökonomen bestehen seit einem Vierteljahrhundert darauf, dass mehr Arbeit geleistet werden muss, um die Klimaschäden abzuschätzen. Dieses Team hat dies getan“, sagte Gernot Wagner, ein Forscher an der Harvard University und ehemaliger Lead Senior Economist beim Environmental Defense Fund, in einer E-Mail. Er war nicht mit der Studie verbunden. Aber diese Betonung des Beobachteten bedeutet, dass die Forschung viele ernsthafte Risiken des Klimawandels ausließ – sogar diejenigen, die die Forscher für wichtig hielten – wenn die Daten, die sie beschreiben, zu dürftig waren. Die Schätzungen beinhalten keine „Nichtmarktgüter“ wie den Verlust von Biodiversität oder natürlicher Pracht. Mit anderen Worten: Die meisten Menschen sind sich einig, dass tote Eisbären einen wirtschaftlichen Preis haben, aber es gibt keinen Konsens darüber, wie man ihn annähern kann. Die Studie berücksichtigt auch nicht die erhöhte Wahrscheinlichkeit von „Tail Risks“ – also unwahrscheinlichen Ereignissen mit katastrophalen Folgen. Viele Forscher glauben, dass die globale Erwärmung soziale Unruhen, Massenmigration oder globale militärische Katastrophen wahrscheinlicher machen wird, aber diese Ereignisse sind per Definition schwer vorherzusagen. Dasselbe gilt für wirtschaftliche Katastrophen, die durch den Beginn einer „Mega-Dürre“ oder den schnellen Zusammenbruch des Grönland-Eisschildes ausgelöst werden. „Als wir die Dust Bowl hatten, sahen wir, wie alle den Mittleren Westen verließen und die Arbeitsmärkte in den städtischen Zentren an der Küste überschwemmten“, sagte Hsiang. Nichts dergleichen wird in der Science-Studie modelliert. Alles in allem sind die Einschätzungen der Studie als der rigoroseste Versuch zu interpretieren, den es je gegeben hat, zu beschreiben, was die globale Erwärmung die Vereinigten Staaten in einer „normalen“ Welt kosten wird. Es beschreibt ein Amerika, das eine gut organisierte Wirtschaft bewahrt hat, als politische Gemeinschaft zusammengehalten wurde und von dem anhaltenden allgemeinen globalen Frieden profitierte, der vor 70 Jahren begann. Selbst in dieser harmonischen Welt wird der Klimawandel die Vereinigten Staaten bezahlen lassen. What Climate Change Will Cost Every U.S. County, 2080–2099 (Kopp, Hsiang, et al. / Science) In der südlichen Hälfte des Landes – und insbesondere in Staaten, die an den Golf von Mexiko grenzen – könnte der Klimawandel das Äquivalent von 20 – Prozent Steuer auf das Einkommen auf Kreisebene, so die Studie.

db830542	„Dies wird ein wichtiges Jahr für [Anekdoten über] die Bedeutung der Temperatur. Trotz der Tatsache, dass diese Wälder in diesem Winter und Frühling wirklich durchnässt waren, haben diese Hitzewellen die Dinge genug ausgetrocknet, um wirklich große Brände zu fördern“, sagt Park Williams, ein Forschungswissenschaftler am Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory an der Columbia University. Mit anderen Worten, die wochenlange Hitze, die den Westen im Juli und August erhitzte, reichte aus, um einen Teil der feuerdämpfenden Wirkung der Winterstürme zu beseitigen. „Die letzten 60 bis 90 Tage waren außergewöhnlich warm und trocken, das perfekte Rezept zum Trocknen von Brennstoffen (die einzige Zutat neben Zündungen, die man für Feuer in diesen Systemen braucht)“, sagte John Abatzoglou, Professor für Geographie an der University of Idaho , in einer E-Mail. „Ich habe heute Morgen ein paar Zahlen gefahren, und die letzten 60 Tage waren von Spokane, Washington, bis Medford, Oregon, rekordverdächtig warm; Sowohl Seattle als auch Missoula stellten Anfang dieses Sommers Rekorde für die längste Anzahl von Tagen ohne messbaren Regen auf.“ Diese übermäßige Hitze kann einen übergroßen Einfluss auf die Größe von Waldbränden haben. Seit mehr als drei Jahrzehnten wissen Waldbrandforscher, dass Feuer und Trockenheit, die durch Hitze kontrolliert wird, in einem exponentiellen Zusammenhang stehen. Jedes Grad Erwärmung trägt mehr zur Förderung des Feuers bei als der vorherige Erwärmungsgrad, sagte Williams. „Wenn wir jetzt an Temperaturtrends aufgrund des vom Menschen verursachten Klimawandels denken, glauben wir, dass es im Westen der Vereinigten Staaten 1,5 [Grad] Celsius oder 3 Grad Fahrenheit heißer ist, als es ohne den Klimawandel wäre. Und dazu kommt noch eine Hitzewelle“, sagte Williams. „Aufgrund des exponentiellen Einflusses der Temperatur bedeutet das, dass diese Hitzewelle einen weitaus schlimmeren Einfluss auf das Feuer hat als ohne eine vom Menschen verursachte Erwärmung.“ In den unkontrollierbaren Folgen jedes zusätzlichen Grads an Erwärmung seien Waldbrände ein „Kanarienvogel in der Kohlemine“ für die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels, sagte Williams. Und die globale Erwärmung wirkt sich bereits auf Waldbrände aus. In einem im vergangenen Jahr in den Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences veröffentlichten Artikel stellten Williams und Abatzoglou fest, dass die Gesamtfläche, die im Westen der Vereinigten Staaten in den letzten 33 Jahren verbrannt wurde, doppelt so groß war wie ohne eine vom Menschen verursachte Erwärmung. „Die zusätzliche Waldbrandfläche – aufgrund von nur anderthalb Grad Erwärmung – entsprach der Fläche von Massachusetts und Connecticut zusammen“, sagte Williams. Andere Forscher sind zu ähnlichen Ergebnissen gekommen. Ein im letzten Jahr in Science veröffentlichtes Papier stellte fest, dass „die Aktivität großer Waldbrände Mitte der 1980er Jahre plötzlich und deutlich zunahm, mit einer höheren Häufigkeit großer Waldbrände, längerer Dauer von Waldbränden und längeren Waldbrandsaisonen”. Die Mitte der 1980er Jahre ist auch die Zeit, in der die meisten Wissenschaftler argumentieren, dass die Auswirkungen der globalen Erwärmung allmählich spürbar wurden.

Das Eis in der Arktis und Antarktis schmolz im Januar auf ein Rekordtief, berichteten Wissenschaftler diese Woche. Meereis ist gefrorenes Meerwasser, das im Sommer schmilzt und im Winter wieder gefriert. Es schwimmt auf dem Ozean. Das arktische Meereis in diesem Januar betrug durchschnittlich 5,17 Millionen Quadratmeilen, die niedrigste für den Monat in der 38-jährigen Meereisaufzeichnung, sagte das National Snow and Ice Data Center. Das sind 100.000 Quadratmeilen weniger als das vorherige Rekordtief vom Januar, das erst letztes Jahr aufgestellt wurde. #Die Ausdehnung des arktischen Meereises im Januar 2017 war der niedrigste Januar in der 38-jährigen Satellitenaufzeichnung. https://t.co/3pPss4vRVJ pic.tweet fallen.

""Durch menschliche Aktivitäten freigesetzte Treibhausgase und der daraus resultierende Anstieg der globalen Durchschnittstemperaturen sind die wahrscheinlichste Ursache für den Rückgang des Meereises"", sagte das Datenzentrum für Schnee und Eis. Auch die Dicke des Meereises ging in der zweiten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts deutlich zurück, so das Datenzentrum für Schnee und Eis. Das antarktische Eis schwankt von Jahr zu Jahr stark, und die Verbindung zur menschengemachten globalen Erwärmung dort ist nicht klar, sagte der NASA-Eisexperte Walt Meier.

b53ea62c	„Offensichtlich kann uns ein einzelnes Jahr, selbst wenn es ein Rekord ist, nicht viel über Klimatrends sagen“, sagte Stefan Rahmstorf, Leiter der Erdsystemanalyse am Potsdam-Institut für Klimafolgenforschung in Deutschland. „Die Tatsache, dass die wärmsten Jahre seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen 2014, 2010 und 2005 waren, zeigt jedoch deutlich, dass die globale Erwärmung nicht ‚1998 aufgehört‘ hat, wie einige gerne fälschlicherweise behaupten.“ Es ist jedoch unwahrscheinlich, dass solche Behauptungen verschwinden. John R. Christy, ein Atmosphärenforscher an der University of Alabama in Huntsville, der für seine Skepsis gegenüber der Schwere der globalen Erwärmung bekannt ist, wies in einem Interview darauf hin, dass 2014 die anderen Rekordwärmejahre nur um wenige Hundertstel eines Jahres übertroffen habe Grad, gut innerhalb der Fehlergrenze globaler Temperaturmessungen. „Seit dem Ende des 20. Jahrhunderts hat die Temperatur nicht viel getan“, sagte Dr. Christy. „Es ist auf so einem warmen Plateau.“ Trotz dieser Argumente einer Handvoll Wissenschaftler sagt die überwiegende Mehrheit derjenigen, die das Klima studieren, dass sich die Erde in einem langfristigen Erwärmungstrend befindet, der zutiefst bedrohlich ist und fast ausschließlich durch menschliche Aktivitäten verursacht wird. Sie erwarten, dass die Hitze in den kommenden Jahrzehnten noch viel schlimmer werden wird, aber sie tötet bereits Wälder auf der ganzen Welt, treibt Pflanzen und Tiere zum Aussterben, schmilzt Landeis und lässt die Meere in immer schnellerem Tempo ansteigen. „Es ist außerordentlich unwahrscheinlich, dass wir Zeuge eines Rekordjahres der Wärme werden, während eines rekordwarmen Jahrzehnts, während einer mehrere Jahrzehnte andauernden Wärmeperiode, die seit mehr als tausend Jahren ihresgleichen zu suchen scheint, wenn es nicht den Anstieg gäbe Niveaus von Gasen, die den Planeten erwärmen und durch die Verbrennung fossiler Brennstoffe entstehen“, sagte Michael E. Mann, ein Klimawissenschaftler an der Pennsylvania State University, in einer E-Mail. Die NASA und die andere amerikanische Behörde, die langfristige Temperaturaufzeichnungen führt, die National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, veröffentlichten am Freitag separate Datensammlungen, die den Rekord von 2014 bestätigten. Eine japanische Agentur hatte Anfang Januar vorläufige Informationen veröffentlicht, aus denen hervorgeht, dass 2014 das wärmste Jahr war.

f4f3e803	Der pakistanischen Sängerin Meesha Shafi drohen nun bis zu drei Jahre Gefängnis, weil sie falsche Anschuldigungen wegen sexueller Belästigung gegen den Schauspieler und Sänger Ali Zafar erhoben hat, der auch in Bollywood umfangreiche Arbeit geleistet hat. Laut einem Bericht hat ein pakistanisches Gericht Meesha nach Ali Zafars Verleumdungsklage gegen Meesha zu drei Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt, weil er „seiner Karriere dank des falschen Falls irreparable Schäden zugefügt hat“. Ali kämpft diesen langwierigen Kampf seit 2018, nachdem Meesha die Vorwürfe gegen ihn erhoben hatte, ungefähr zu der Zeit, als die #MeToo-Bewegung überall auf der Welt an Fahrt gewann. Meesha ist jedoch überhaupt nicht glücklich mit dem Urteil. Gegenüber einem internationalen Portal sagte sie offenbar: „Welche Frau hat in einem solchen Fall Recht und zu welchem ​​Preis?“. Meesha hatte zu der Zeit, als er Ali beschuldigte, gesagt: „Ich war mehr als einmal sexueller Belästigung körperlicher Art durch einen Kollegen aus meiner Branche ausgesetzt: Ali Zafar. Diese Vorfälle ereigneten sich nicht, als ich jung war oder gerade in die Branche einstieg. Das ist mir passiert, obwohl ich eine ermächtigte, versierte Frau bin, die dafür bekannt ist, ihre Meinung zu sagen! Das ist mir als Mutter von zwei Kindern passiert.“ Ali hat in einer langen Erklärung alle Vorwürfe kategorisch zurückgewiesen, indem er eine Erklärung abgegeben hat. Der 'Mere Brother Ki Dulhan'-Schauspieler reichte zusammen mit acht weiteren Personen, die ihn beschuldigten, eine Verleumdungsklage gegen Meesha ein. Unterdessen wollen ihre Anwälte die Anklage gegen sie anfechten. Während Zafar alle Anschuldigungen zurückwies, hatte er geschrieben: „Ich weise kategorisch alle Behauptungen von Frau Shafi wegen Belästigung gegen mich zurück. Ich beabsichtige, dies vor Gericht zu bringen und dies professionell und ernsthaft anzusprechen, anstatt hier Vorwürfe zu erheben, persönliche Rachefeldzüge in den sozialen Medien zu bestreiten und im Gegenzug die Bewegung, meine Familie, die Industrie und meine Fans zu missachten.

a9bebdd3	Ein Großteil der jüngsten globalen Erwärmung wurde von Klimawissenschaftlern erfunden, um sie beängstigender aussehen zu lassen, hat eine Studie herausgefunden. Die Peer-Review-Studie von zwei Wissenschaftlern und einem erfahrenen Statistiker untersuchte die globalen Durchschnittstemperatur-Datensätze (GAST), die von Klimaalarmisten verwendet werden, um zu argumentieren, dass die letzten Jahre „die heißesten Evahs“ waren und dass die Erwärmung der letzten 120 Jahre dies getan hat war dramatisch und beispiellos. Sie fanden heraus, dass diese Messwerte „völlig unvereinbar mit veröffentlichten und glaubwürdigen US- und anderen Temperaturdaten“ sind. Das heißt, die angepassten Daten, die von alarmistischen Organisationen wie NASA, NOAA und dem UK Met Office verwendet werden, unterscheiden sich so deutlich von den ursprünglichen Rohdaten, dass man ihnen nicht vertrauen kann. Dieses Diagramm gibt Ihnen eine gute Vorstellung von der Richtung der Anpassungen. Die blauen Balken zeigen, wo die rohen Temperaturdaten nach unten korrigiert wurden, um sie kühler zu machen; die roten Balken zeigen, wo die Temperaturrohdaten nach oben korrigiert wurden, um sie wärmer zu machen. Beachten Sie, dass die meisten Anpassungen nach unten im frühen zwanzigsten Jahrhundert und die meisten Anpassungen nach oben im späten zwanzigsten Jahrhundert stattfanden. Laut dem Meteorologen Joe D'Aleo, der die Studie gemeinsam mit dem Statistiker James Wallace und dem Klimawissenschaftler Craig Idso vom Cato Institute verfasst hat, hat dies den Effekt, dass der Erwärmungstrend übertrieben wird: „Fast die gesamte Erwärmung, die sie jetzt zeigen, ist in den Anpassungen enthalten .“ „Jeder Datensatz drückte die Erwärmung der 1940er Jahre nach unten und die aktuelle Erwärmung nach oben.“ „Sie würden denken, dass Sie beim Vornehmen von Anpassungen manchmal wärmer und manchmal kühler werden. Das ist fast nie passiert.“ Der Bericht kommt zu dem Schluss, dass dies bedeutet, dass Behauptungen der NASA, der NOAA und des UK Met Office, dass die Welt eine beispiellose und dramatische Erwärmung erlebt, mit Vorsicht zu genießen sind: Sie alle verwenden die gleiche verfälschte globale Durchschnittstemperatur ( GAST)-Daten.

903d335b	Jahrzehntelang sahen die meisten Wissenschaftler den Klimawandel in weiter Ferne. Wir wissen jetzt, dass das Denken falsch war. In diesem Sommer drang zum Beispiel eine Hitzewelle in Europa in die Arktis ein, drückte die Temperaturen in weiten Teilen des hohen Nordens auf die 80er-Marke und ließ laut dem belgischen Klimawissenschaftler Xavier Fettweis etwa 40 Milliarden Tonnen Grönlands Eisdecke schmelzen. Hätte ein Wissenschaftler in den frühen 1990er Jahren vorgeschlagen, dass innerhalb von 25 Jahren eine einzige Hitzewelle den Meeresspiegel messbar um geschätzte zwei Hundertstel Zoll anheben, die Arktis ausheizen und in Paris und Berlin Sahara-ähnliche Temperaturen erzeugen würde, wäre die Vorhersage so gewesen wurden als alarmierend abgetan. Doch viele Worst-Case-Szenarien von damals sind heute Realität. Wissenschaft ist ein Entdeckungsprozess. Es kann sich langsam bewegen, wenn die Teile eines Puzzles zusammenfallen und Wissenschaftler ihre Untersuchungswerkzeuge verfeinern. Aber im Fall des Klimas wurde diese Überlegung von Trägheit begleitet, die aus bürokratischer Vorsicht und Politik entstanden ist. Ein kürzlich erschienener Aufsatz in Scientific American argumentierte, dass Wissenschaftler „dazu neigen, die Schwere von Bedrohungen und die Geschwindigkeit, mit der sie sich entfalten könnten, zu unterschätzen“, und sagte, einer der Gründe sei „das wahrgenommene Bedürfnis nach Konsens“. Dies hatte schwerwiegende Folgen, verwässerte das, was ein Gefühl der Dringlichkeit hätte haben sollen, und unterschätzte die drohenden Kosten der Anpassung und Verlagerung, während sich der Planet weiter erwärmt. 1990 sagte der Zwischenstaatliche Ausschuss für Klimaänderungen, die Gruppe der Vereinten Nationen aus Tausenden von Wissenschaftlern aus 195 Ländern, in seinem ersten Bericht, dass der Klimawandel in einem stattlichen Tempo eintreten würde und dass der mit Methan beladene arktische Permafrostboden nicht vom Auftauen bedroht sei , und dass die antarktischen Eisschilde stabil waren.

INCHEON, Südkorea – Ein wegweisender Bericht des wissenschaftlichen Gremiums der Vereinten Nationen zum Klimawandel zeichnet ein weitaus düstereres Bild der unmittelbaren Folgen des Klimawandels als bisher angenommen und besagt, dass die Vermeidung des Schadens eine rasche und umfassende Umgestaltung der Weltwirtschaft erfordert das hat „keinen dokumentierten historischen Präzedenzfall“. Der Bericht, der am Montag vom Zwischenstaatlichen Ausschuss für Klimawandel veröffentlicht wurde, einer Gruppe von Wissenschaftlern, die von den Vereinten Nationen einberufen wurde, um die führenden Politiker der Welt anzuleiten, beschreibt eine Welt mit sich verschlimmernder Nahrungsmittelknappheit und Waldbränden sowie einem Massensterben von Korallenriffen 2040 – ein Zeitraum, der noch lange zu Lebzeiten eines Großteils der Weltbevölkerung liegt. Der Bericht „ist ein ziemlicher Schock und ziemlich besorgniserregend“, sagte Bill Hare, ein Autor früherer I.P.C.C. Berichte und ein Physiker bei Climate Analytics, einer gemeinnützigen Organisation. „Das war uns vor ein paar Jahren noch nicht bewusst.“ Der Bericht war der erste, der von führenden Politikern der Welt im Rahmen des Pariser Abkommens in Auftrag gegeben wurde, dem Pakt der Nationen von 2015 zur Bekämpfung der globalen Erwärmung. Die Autoren stellten fest, dass sich die Atmosphäre bis 2040 um bis zu 1,5 Grad Celsius gegenüber dem vorindustriellen Niveau erwärmen wird, wenn die Treibhausgasemissionen mit der derzeitigen Geschwindigkeit anhalten, wodurch die Küsten überschwemmt und Dürren und Armut verstärkt werden. Frühere Arbeiten konzentrierten sich darauf, den Schaden abzuschätzen, wenn die Durchschnittstemperaturen um einen größeren Wert von 3,6 Grad Fahrenheit (2 Grad Celsius) steigen würden, da dies die Schwelle war, die Wissenschaftler zuvor für die schwerwiegendsten Auswirkungen des Klimawandels in Betracht gezogen hatten.

e8a7c497	El Niño ist nun zu Ende, und Klimawissenschaftler erwarten fast überall, dass 2017 kühler sein wird als das Jahr zuvor. Aber das Ausmaß des Hitzeausbruchs hat viele Experten erschreckt, und einige von ihnen befürchten, dass in den nächsten Jahren eine beschleunigte Ära der globalen Erwärmung bevorstehen könnte. Selbst bei den aktuellen Temperaturen schmelzen Milliarden Tonnen Landeis oder rutschen in den Ozean. Das Meer absorbiert auch den größten Teil der Wärme, die durch menschliche Emissionen eingeschlossen wird. Diese Faktoren führen dazu, dass der Ozean scheinbar immer schneller ansteigt, und Küstengemeinden in den Vereinigten Staaten beginnen, Milliarden für die Bekämpfung der zunehmenden Gezeitenfluten auszugeben. Ihre Hilferufe des Kongresses wurden weitgehend ignoriert. Das Ergebnis, dass das dritte Jahr in Folge ein Rekord aufgestellt wurde, wurde am Mittwoch von drei Regierungsbehörden veröffentlicht, zwei davon amerikanisch und eine britisch, die Messungen von Schiffen, Bojen und landgestützten Wetterstationen verfolgen. Sie analysieren die Zahlen, um bekannte Probleme zu korrigieren, und erzeugen eine jährliche Durchschnittstemperatur für die Erdoberfläche. Die nationale Wetterbehörde Japans bestätigte die Ergebnisse in einer vorläufigen Analyse. Im britischen Datensatz stellte 2016 nur um einen kleinen Betrag einen Rekord auf; die Marge war im NOAA-Datensatz größer und noch größer im NASA-Datensatz. Die NASA leistet mehr Arbeit als die anderen Gruppen, um die arktischen Temperaturen vollständig zu berücksichtigen, und mehrere Wissenschaftler sagten, sie glaubten, dass die NASA-Aufzeichnung aus diesem Grund die genaueste für 2016 sei.

c32f210d	Höhepunkte der Geschichte Es ist ein Schlüsselindikator für den Klimawandel und kann Wetteränderungen bedeuten Die Temperaturen am Nordpol liegen 30 Grad über dem Normalwert (CNN) Zum ersten Mal, seit Wissenschaftler damit begonnen haben, das Meereis in der Arktis und Antarktis zu verfolgen sind zu dieser Jahreszeit auf Rekordtiefs. „Es sieht so aus, als ob wir seit Anfang Oktober zum ersten Mal sowohl das arktische als auch das antarktische Meereis auf Rekordtiefs laufen sehen“, sagte Walt Meier, ein Forschungswissenschaftler am Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory beim Goddard Space Flight der NASA Center, der Meereisdaten zurückverfolgt hat, die bis ins Jahr 1979 zurückreichen. Während ein Rekordtief an Meereis in der Arktis nichts Neues ist, ist dies eine überraschende Wendung der Ereignisse für die Antarktis. Auch wenn das Meereis in der Arktis in den letzten zehn Jahren einen raschen und beständigen Rückgang erlebt hat, hat sein Gegenstück in der südlichen Hemisphäre eine zunehmende Ausdehnung erlebt. Tatsächlich erreichte jedes Jahr von 2012 bis 2014 ein Rekordhoch für die Ausdehnung des antarktischen Meereises. Skeptiker haben lange auf die Eiszunahme in der südlichen Hemisphäre als Beweis dafür hingewiesen, dass kein Klimawandel stattfand, aber Wissenschaftler warnten davor, dass er durch natürliche Schwankungen und Zirkulationen in der Atmosphäre verursacht wurde. Während es noch zu früh ist, um zu wissen, ob der jüngste, schnelle Rückgang des Meereises in der Antarktis ein regelmäßiges Ereignis wie in der Arktis sein wird, versetzt es „sicherlich jeden ins Wanken, der sagt, dass das Eis der Antarktis immer höher und höher wird“, so Meier genannt.

Solche Ereignisse sind nur ein früher Vorbote des kommenden Schadens, wie die neue Forschung nahelegt. „Ich denke, wir brauchen eine neue Art, über die meisten Küstenüberschwemmungen nachzudenken“, sagte Benjamin H. Strauss, der Hauptautor einer von zwei verwandten Studien, die am Montag veröffentlicht wurden. „Es ist nicht die Flut. Es ist nicht der Wind. Wir sind es. Das gilt für die meisten Küstenfluten, die wir jetzt erleben.“ In der zweiten Studie rekonstruierten Wissenschaftler den Meeresspiegel im Laufe der Zeit und bestätigten, dass er höchstwahrscheinlich schneller ansteigt als jemals zuvor in 28 Jahrhunderten, wobei die Anstiegsrate im letzten Jahrhundert stark zugenommen hat – vor allem wegen Die Erwärmung, von der Wissenschaftler sagten, dass sie mit ziemlicher Sicherheit durch menschliche Emissionen verursacht wird. Sie bestätigten auch frühere Prognosen, dass der Ozean bis 2100 um bis zu drei oder vier Fuß ansteigen könnte, wenn die Emissionen in den nächsten Jahrzehnten auf hohem Niveau anhalten würden. Experten sagen, dass sich die Situation im 22. Jahrhundert und darüber hinaus noch viel verschlimmern würde , was wahrscheinlich die Aufgabe vieler Küstenstädte erfordert.

Um Frau May daran zu erinnern, womit sie und die EU in den nächsten 18 Monaten konfrontiert sind, soll Juncker zwei Dokumente auf den Tisch gelegt haben, das Handelsabkommen der EU mit Kanada und den Beitrittsvertrag der EU mit Kroatien im Jahr 2011. Beides sehr relevant für unsere Besorgnis, denn Frau May hofft nicht nur, ein beispielloses Handelsabkommen auszuhandeln: Am Ende der Verhandlungen muss es auch einen Sezessionsvertrag geben, der weitgehend denselben Inhalt wie ein Beitrittsvertrag hat, aber umgekehrt . Das Umfassende Wirtschafts- und Handelsabkommen (CETA), das Kanada viel weniger Zugang zum europäischen Markt verschaffte, als wir es jetzt genießen, ist unglaublich komplex, umfasste 1.598 Seiten und es dauerte sieben Jahre, um es auszuhandeln.

Das Ausmaß der Eisbedeckung – ein Rekordtief im dritten Jahr in Folge – ist ein weiterer Indikator für die Auswirkungen der globalen Erwärmung auf die Arktis, eine Region, die zu den am stärksten vom Klimawandel betroffenen Regionen gehört, sagten Wissenschaftler. „Dies ist nur ein weiteres Ausrufezeichen für den Gesamtverlust der arktischen Meereisbedeckung, den wir beobachten“, sagte Mark Serreze, der Direktor des National Snow and Ice Data Center, einer von der Regierung unterstützten Forschungsagentur in Boulder, Colorado. „Wir steuern auf Sommer ohne Meereisbedeckung zu.“ Dr. Serreze sagte, dass eine solche Situation, die im Sommer bis zum Beginn des Frosts im Herbst nichts als offenen Ozean hinterlassen würde, bis 2030 eintreten könnte, obwohl viele Wissenschaftler sagen, dass dies möglicherweise erst ein oder zwei Jahrzehnte später der Fall sein wird.

62682d8e	1. “LAUDATO SI’, mi’ Signore” – “Praise be to you, my Lord”. In the words of this beautiful canticle, Saint Francis of Assisi reminds us that our common home is like a sister with whom we share our life and a beautiful mother who opens her arms to embrace us. “Praise be to you, my Lord, through our Sister, Mother Earth, who sustains and governs us, and who produces various fruit with coloured flowers and herbs”.[1] 2. This sister now cries out to us because of the harm we have inflicted on her by our irresponsible use and abuse of the goods with which God has endowed her. We have come to see ourselves as her lords and masters, entitled to plunder her at will. The violence present in our hearts, wounded by sin, is also reflected in the symptoms of sickness evident in the soil, in the water, in the air and in all forms of life. This is why the earth herself, burdened and laid waste, is among the most abandoned and maltreated of our poor; she “groans in travail” (Rom 8:22). We have forgotten that we ourselves are dust of the earth (cf. Gen 2:7); our very bodies are made up of her elements, we breathe her air and we receive life and refreshment from her waters. Nothing in this world is indifferent to us 3. More than fifty years ago, with the world teetering on the brink of nuclear crisis, Pope Saint John XXIII wrote an Encyclical which not only rejected war but offered a proposal for peace. He addressed his message Pacem in Terris to the entire “Catholic world” and indeed “to all men and women of good will”. Now, faced as we are with global environmental deterioration, I wish to address every person living on this planet. In my Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Gaudium, I wrote to all the members of the Church with the aim of encouraging ongoing missionary renewal. In this Encyclical, I would like to enter into dialogue with all people about our common home. 4. In 1971, eight years after Pacem in Terris, Blessed Pope Paul VI referred to the ecological concern as “a tragic consequence” of unchecked human activity: “Due to an ill-considered exploitation of nature, humanity runs the risk of destroying it and becoming in turn a victim of this degradation”.[2] He spoke in similar terms to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations about the potential for an “ecological catastrophe under the effective explosion of industrial civilization”, and stressed “the urgent need for a radical change in the conduct of humanity”, inasmuch as “the most extraordinary scientific advances, the most amazing technical abilities, the most astonishing economic growth, unless they are accompanied by authentic social and moral progress, will definitively turn against man”.[3] 5. Saint John Paul II became increasingly concerned about this issue. In his first Encyclical he warned that human beings frequently seem “to see no other meaning in their natural environment than what serves for immediate use and consumption”.[4] Subsequently, he would call for a global ecological conversion.[5] At the same time, he noted that little effort had been made to “safeguard the moral conditions for an authentic human ecology”.[6] The destruction of the human environment is extremely serious, not only because God has entrusted the world to us men and women, but because human life is itself a gift which must be defended from various forms of debasement. Every effort to protect and improve our world entails profound changes in “lifestyles, models of production and consumption, and the established structures of power which today govern societies”.[7] Authentic human development has a moral character. It presumes full respect for the human person, but it must also be concerned for the world around us and “take into account the nature of each being and of its mutual connection in an ordered system”.[8] Accordingly, our human ability to transform reality must proceed in line with God’s original gift of all that is.[9] 6. My predecessor Benedict XVI likewise proposed “eliminating the structural causes of the dysfunctions of the world economy and correcting models of growth which have proved incapable of ensuring respect for the environment”.[10] He observed that the world cannot be analyzed by isolating only one of its aspects, since “the book of nature is one and indivisible”, and includes the environment, life, sexuality, the family, social relations, and so forth. It follows that “the deterioration of nature is closely connected to the culture which shapes human coexistence”.[11] Pope Benedict asked us to recognize that the natural environment has been gravely damaged by our irresponsible behaviour. The social environment has also suffered damage. Both are ultimately due to the same evil: the notion that there are no indisputable truths to guide our lives, and hence human freedom is limitless. We have forgotten that “man is not only a freedom which he creates for himself. Man does not create himself. He is spirit and will, but also nature”.[12] With paternal concern, Benedict urged us to realize that creation is harmed “where we ourselves have the final word, where everything is simply our property and we use it for ourselves alone. The misuse of creation begins when we no longer recognize any higher instance than ourselves, when we see nothing else but ourselves”.[13] United by the same concern 7. These statements of the Popes echo the reflections of numerous scientists, philosophers, theologians and civic groups, all of which have enriched the Church’s thinking on these questions. Outside the Catholic Church, other Churches and Christian communities – and other religions as well – have expressed deep concern and offered valuable reflections on issues which all of us find disturbing. To give just one striking example, I would mention the statements made by the beloved Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, with whom we share the hope of full ecclesial communion. 8. Patriarch Bartholomew has spoken in particular of the need for each of us to repent of the ways we have harmed the planet, for “inasmuch as we all generate small ecological damage”, we are called to acknowledge “our contribution, smaller or greater, to the disfigurement and destruction of creation”.[14] He has repeatedly stated this firmly and persuasively, challenging us to acknowledge our sins against creation: “For human beings… to destroy the biological diversity of God’s creation; for human beings to degrade the integrity of the earth by causing changes in its climate, by stripping the earth of its natural forests or destroying its wetlands; for human beings to contaminate the earth’s waters, its land, its air, and its life – these are sins”.[15] For “to commit a crime against the natural world is a sin against ourselves and a sin against God”.[16] 9. At the same time, Bartholomew has drawn attention to the ethical and spiritual roots of environmental problems, which require that we look for solutions not only in technology but in a change of humanity; otherwise we would be dealing merely with symptoms. He asks us to replace consumption with sacrifice, greed with generosity, wastefulness with a spirit of sharing, an asceticism which “entails learning to give, and not simply to give up. It is a way of loving, of moving gradually away from what I want to what God’s world needs. It is liberation from fear, greed and compulsion”.[17] As Christians, we are also called “to accept the world as a sacrament of communion, as a way of sharing with God and our neighbours on a global scale. It is our humble conviction that the divine and the human meet in the slightest detail in the seamless garment of God’s creation, in the last speck of dust of our planet”.[18] Saint Francis of Assisi 10. I do not want to write this Encyclical without turning to that attractive and compelling figure, whose name I took as my guide and inspiration when I was elected Bishop of Rome. I believe that Saint Francis is the example par excellence of care for the vulnerable and of an integral ecology lived out joyfully and authentically. He is the patron saint of all who study and work in the area of ecology, and he is also much loved by non-Christians. He was particularly concerned for God’s creation and for the poor and outcast. He loved, and was deeply loved for his joy, his generous self-giving, his openheartedness. He was a mystic and a pilgrim who lived in simplicity and in wonderful harmony with God, with others, with nature and with himself. He shows us just how inseparable the bond is between concern for nature, justice for the poor, commitment to society, and interior peace. 11. Francis helps us to see that an integral ecology calls for openness to categories which transcend the language of mathematics and biology, and take us to the heart of what it is to be human. Just as happens when we fall in love with someone, whenever he would gaze at the sun, the moon or the smallest of animals, he burst into song, drawing all other creatures into his praise. He communed with all creation, even preaching to the flowers, inviting them “to praise the Lord, just as if they were endowed with reason”.[19] His response to the world around him was so much more than intellectual appreciation or economic calculus, for to him each and every creature was a sister united to him by bonds of affection. That is why he felt called to care for all that exists. His disciple Saint Bonaventure tells us that, “from a reflection on the primary source of all things, filled with even more abundant piety, he would call creatures, no matter how small, by the name of ‘brother’ or ‘sister’”.[20] Such a conviction cannot be written off as naive romanticism, for it affects the choices which determine our behaviour. If we approach nature and the environment without this openness to awe and wonder, if we no longer speak the language of fraternity and beauty in our relationship with the world, our attitude will be that of masters, consumers, ruthless exploiters, unable to set limits on their immediate needs. By contrast, if we feel intimately united with all that exists, then sobriety and care will well up spontaneously. The poverty and austerity of Saint Francis were no mere veneer of asceticism, but something much more radical: a refusal to turn reality into an object simply to be used and controlled. 12. What is more, Saint Francis, faithful to Scripture, invites us to see nature as a magnificent book in which God speaks to us and grants us a glimpse of his infinite beauty and goodness. “Through the greatness and the beauty of creatures one comes to know by analogy their maker” (Wis 13:5); indeed, “his eternal power and divinity have been made known through his works since the creation of the world” (Rom 1:20). For this reason, Francis asked that part of the friary garden always be left untouched, so that wild flowers and herbs could grow there, and those who saw them could raise their minds to God, the Creator of such beauty.[21] Rather than a problem to be solved, the world is a joyful mystery to be contemplated with gladness and praise. My appeal 13. The urgent challenge to protect our common home includes a concern to bring the whole human family together to seek a sustainable and integral development, for we know that things can change. The Creator does not abandon us; he never forsakes his loving plan or repents of having created us. Humanity still has the ability to work together in building our common home. Here I want to recognize, encourage and thank all those striving in countless ways to guarantee the protection of the home which we share. Particular appreciation is owed to those who tirelessly seek to resolve the tragic effects of environmental degradation on the lives of the world’s poorest. Young people demand change. They wonder how anyone can claim to be building a better future without thinking of the environmental crisis and the sufferings of the excluded. 14. I urgently appeal, then, for a new dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet. We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all. The worldwide ecological movement has already made considerable progress and led to the establishment of numerous organizations committed to raising awareness of these challenges. Regrettably, many efforts to seek concrete solutions to the environmental crisis have proved ineffective, not only because of powerful opposition but also because of a more general lack of interest. Obstructionist attitudes, even on the part of believers, can range from denial of the problem to indifference, nonchalant resignation or blind confidence in technical solutions. We require a new and universal solidarity. As the bishops of Southern Africa have stated: “Everyone’s talents and involvement are needed to redress the damage caused by human abuse of God’s creation”. [22] All of us can cooperate as instruments of God for the care of creation, each according to his or her own culture, experience, involvements and talents. 15. It is my hope that this Encyclical Letter, which is now added to the body of the Church’s social teaching, can help us to acknowledge the appeal, immensity and urgency of the challenge we face. I will begin by briefly reviewing several aspects of the present ecological crisis, with the aim of drawing on the results of the best scientific research available today, letting them touch us deeply and provide a concrete foundation for the ethical and spiritual itinerary that follows. I will then consider some principles drawn from the Judaeo-Christian tradition which can render our commitment to the environment more coherent. I will then attempt to get to the roots of the present situation, so as to consider not only its symptoms but also its deepest causes. This will help to provide an approach to ecology which respects our unique place as human beings in this world and our relationship to our surroundings. In light of this reflection, I will advance some broader proposals for dialogue and action which would involve each of us as individuals, and also affect international policy. Finally, convinced as I am that change is impossible without motivation and a process of education, I will offer some inspired guidelines for human development to be found in the treasure of Christian spiritual experience. 16. Although each chapter will have its own subject and specific approach, it will also take up and re-examine important questions previously dealt with. This is particularly the case with a number of themes which will reappear as the Encyclical unfolds. As examples, I will point to the intimate relationship between the poor and the fragility of the planet, the conviction that everything in the world is connected, the critique of new paradigms and forms of power derived from technology, the call to seek other ways of understanding the economy and progress, the value proper to each creature, the human meaning of ecology, the need for forthright and honest debate, the serious responsibility of international and local policy, the throwaway culture and the proposal of a new lifestyle. These questions will not be dealt with once and for all, but reframed and enriched again and again. CHAPTER ONE WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR COMMON HOME 17. Theological and philosophical reflections on the situation of humanity and the world can sound tiresome and abstract, unless they are grounded in a fresh analysis of our present situation, which is in many ways unprecedented in the history of humanity. So, before considering how faith brings new incentives and requirements with regard to the world of which we are a part, I will briefly turn to what is happening to our common home. 18. The continued acceleration of changes affecting humanity and the planet is coupled today with a more intensified pace of life and work which might be called “rapidification”. Although change is part of the working of complex systems, the speed with which human activity has developed contrasts with the naturally slow pace of biological evolution. Moreover, the goals of this rapid and constant change are not necessarily geared to the common good or to integral and sustainable human development. Change is something desirable, yet it becomes a source of anxiety when it causes harm to the world and to the quality of life of much of humanity. 19. Following a period of irrational confidence in progress and human abilities, some sectors of society are now adopting a more critical approach. We see increasing sensitivity to the environment and the need to protect nature, along with a growing concern, both genuine and distressing, for what is happening to our planet. Let us review, however cursorily, those questions which are troubling us today and which we can no longer sweep under the carpet. Our goal is not to amass information or to satisfy curiosity, but rather to become painfully aware, to dare to turn what is happening to the world into our own personal suffering and thus to discover what each of us can do about it. I. POLLUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE Pollution, waste and the throwaway culture 20. Some forms of pollution are part of people’s daily experience. Exposure to atmospheric pollutants produces a broad spectrum of health hazards, especially for the poor, and causes millions of premature deaths. People take sick, for example, from breathing high levels of smoke from fuels used in cooking or heating. There is also pollution that affects everyone, caused by transport, industrial fumes, substances which contribute to the acidification of soil and water, fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides and agrotoxins in general. Technology, which, linked to business interests, is presented as the only way of solving these problems, in fact proves incapable of seeing the mysterious network of relations between things and so sometimes solves one problem only to create others. 21. Account must also be taken of the pollution produced by residue, including dangerous waste present in different areas. Each year hundreds of millions of tons of waste are generated, much of it non-biodegradable, highly toxic and radioactive, from homes and businesses, from construction and demolition sites, from clinical, electronic and industrial sources. The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth. In many parts of the planet, the elderly lament that once beautiful landscapes are now covered with rubbish. Industrial waste and chemical products utilized in cities and agricultural areas can lead to bioaccumulation in the organisms of the local population, even when levels of toxins in those places are low. Frequently no measures are taken until after people’s health has been irreversibly affected. 22. These problems are closely linked to a throwaway culture which affects the excluded just as it quickly reduces things to rubbish. To cite one example, most of the paper we produce is thrown away and not recycled. It is hard for us to accept that the way natural ecosystems work is exemplary: plants synthesize nutrients which feed herbivores; these in turn become food for carnivores, which produce significant quantities of organic waste which give rise to new generations of plants. But our industrial system, at the end of its cycle of production and consumption, has not developed the capacity to absorb and reuse waste and by-products. We have not yet managed to adopt a circular model of production capable of preserving resources for present and future generations, while limiting as much as possible the use of non-renewable resources, moderating their consumption, maximizing their efficient use, reusing and recycling them. A serious consideration of this issue would be one way of counteracting the throwaway culture which affects the entire planet, but it must be said that only limited progress has been made in this regard. Climate as a common good 23. The climate is a common good, belonging to all and meant for all. At the global level, it is a complex system linked to many of the essential conditions for human life. A very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic system. In recent decades this warming has been accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and, it would appear, by an increase of extreme weather events, even if a scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned to each particular phenomenon. Humanity is called to recognize the need for changes of lifestyle, production and consumption, in order to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it. It is true that there are other factors (such as volcanic activity, variations in the earth’s orbit and axis, the solar cycle), yet a number of scientific studies indicate that most global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly as a result of human activity. As these gases build up in the atmosphere, they hamper the escape of heat produced by sunlight at the earth’s surface. The problem is aggravated by a model of development based on the intensive use of fossil fuels, which is at the heart of the worldwide energy system. Another determining factor has been an increase in changed uses of the soil, principally deforestation for agricultural purposes. 24. Warming has effects on the carbon cycle. It creates a vicious circle which aggravates the situation even more, affecting the availability of essential resources like drinking water, energy and agricultural production in warmer regions, and leading to the extinction of part of the planet’s biodiversity. The melting in the polar ice caps and in high altitude plains can lead to the dangerous release of methane gas, while the decomposition of frozen organic material can further increase the emission of carbon dioxide. Things are made worse by the loss of tropical forests which would otherwise help to mitigate climate change. Carbon dioxide pollution increases the acidification of the oceans and compromises the marine food chain. If present trends continue, this century may well witness extraordinary climate change and an unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequences for all of us. A rise in the sea level, for example, can create extremely serious situations, if we consider that a quarter of the world’s population lives on the coast or nearby, and that the majority of our megacities are situated in coastal areas. 25. Climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods. It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day. Its worst impact will probably be felt by developing countries in coming decades. Many of the poor live in areas particularly affected by phenomena related to warming, and their means of subsistence are largely dependent on natural reserves and ecosystemic services such as agriculture, fishing and forestry. They have no other financial activities or resources which can enable them to adapt to climate change or to face natural disasters, and their access to social services and protection is very limited. For example, changes in climate, to which animals and plants cannot adapt, lead them to migrate; this in turn affects the livelihood of the poor, who are then forced to leave their homes, with great uncertainty for their future and that of their children. There has been a tragic rise in the number of migrants seeking to flee from the growing poverty caused by environmental degradation. They are not recognized by international conventions as refugees; they bear the loss of the lives they have left behind, without enjoying any legal protection whatsoever. Sadly, there is widespread indifference to such suffering, which is even now taking place throughout our world. Our lack of response to these tragedies involving our brothers and sisters points to the loss of that sense of responsibility for our fellow men and women upon which all civil society is founded. 26. Many of those who possess more resources and economic or political power seem mostly to be concerned with masking the problems or concealing their symptoms, simply making efforts to reduce some of the negative impacts of climate change. However, many of these symptoms indicate that such effects will continue to worsen if we continue with current models of production and consumption. There is an urgent need to develop policies so that, in the next few years, the emission of carbon dioxide and other highly polluting gases can be drastically reduced, for example, substituting for fossil fuels and developing sources of renewable energy. Worldwide there is minimal access to clean and renewable energy. There is still a need to develop adequate storage technologies. Some countries have made considerable progress, although it is far from constituting a significant proportion. Investments have also been made in means of production and transportation which consume less energy and require fewer raw materials, as well as in methods of construction and renovating buildings which improve their energy efficiency. But these good practices are still far from widespread. II. THE ISSUE OF WATER 27. Other indicators of the present situation have to do with the depletion of natural resources. We all know that it is not possible to sustain the present level of consumption in developed countries and wealthier sectors of society, where the habit of wasting and discarding has reached unprecedented levels. The exploitation of the planet has already exceeded acceptable limits and we still have not solved the problem of poverty. 28. Fresh drinking water is an issue of primary importance, since it is indispensable for human life and for supporting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Sources of fresh water are necessary for health care, agriculture and industry. Water supplies used to be relatively constant, but now in many places demand exceeds the sustainable supply, with dramatic consequences in the short and long term. Large cities dependent on significant supplies of water have experienced periods of shortage, and at critical moments these have not always been administered with sufficient oversight and impartiality. Water poverty especially affects Africa where large sectors of the population have no access to safe drinking water or experience droughts which impede agricultural production. Some countries have areas rich in water while others endure drastic scarcity. 29. One particularly serious problem is the quality of water available to the poor. Every day, unsafe water results in many deaths and the spread of water-related diseases, including those caused by microorganisms and chemical substances. Dysentery and cholera, linked to inadequate hygiene and water supplies, are a significant cause of suffering and of infant mortality. Underground water sources in many places are threatened by the pollution produced in certain mining, farming and industrial activities, especially in countries lacking adequate regulation or controls. It is not only a question of industrial waste. Detergents and chemical products, commonly used in many places of the world, continue to pour into our rivers, lakes and seas. 30. Even as the quality of available water is constantly diminishing, in some places there is a growing tendency, despite its scarcity, to privatize this resource, turning it into a commodity subject to the laws of the market. Yet access to safe drinkable water is a basic and universal human right, since it is essential to human survival and, as such, is a condition for the exercise of other human rights. Our world has a grave social debt towards the poor who lack access to drinking water, because they are denied the right to a life consistent with their inalienable dignity. This debt can be paid partly by an increase in funding to provide clean water and sanitary services among the poor. But water continues to be wasted, not only in the developed world but also in developing countries which possess it in abundance. This shows that the problem of water is partly an educational and cultural issue, since there is little awareness of the seriousness of such behaviour within a context of great inequality. 31. Greater scarcity of water will lead to an increase in the cost of food and the various products which depend on its use. Some studies warn that an acute water shortage may occur within a few decades unless urgent action is taken. The environmental repercussions could affect billions of people; it is also conceivable that the control of water by large multinational businesses may become a major source of conflict in this century.[23] III. LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY 32. The earth’s resources are also being plundered because of short-sighted approaches to the economy, commerce and production. The loss of forests and woodlands entails the loss of species which may constitute extremely important resources in the future, not only for food but also for curing disease and other uses. Different species contain genes which could be key resources in years ahead for meeting human needs and regulating environmental problems. 33. It is not enough, however, to think of different species merely as potential “resources” to be exploited, while overlooking the fact that they have value in themselves. Each year sees the disappearance of thousands of plant and animal species which we will never know, which our children will never see, because they have been lost for ever. The great majority become extinct for reasons related to human activity. Because of us, thousands of species will no longer give glory to God by their very existence, nor convey their message to us. We have no such right. 34. It may well disturb us to learn of the extinction of mammals or birds, since they are more visible. But the good functioning of ecosystems also requires fungi, algae, worms, insects, reptiles and an innumerable variety of microorganisms. Some less numerous species, although generally unseen, nonetheless play a critical role in maintaining the equilibrium of a particular place. Human beings must intervene when a geosystem reaches a critical state. But nowadays, such intervention in nature has become more and more frequent. As a consequence, serious problems arise, leading to further interventions; human activity becomes ubiquitous, with all the risks which this entails. Often a vicious circle results, as human intervention to resolve a problem further aggravates the situation. For example, many birds and insects which disappear due to synthetic agrotoxins are helpful for agriculture: their disappearance will have to be compensated for by yet other techniques which may well prove harmful. We must be grateful for the praiseworthy efforts being made by scientists and engineers dedicated to finding solutions to man-made problems. But a sober look at our world shows that the degree of human intervention, often in the service of business interests and consumerism, is actually making our earth less rich and beautiful, ever more limited and grey, even as technological advances and consumer goods continue to abound limitlessly. We seem to think that we can substitute an irreplaceable and irretrievable beauty with something which we have created ourselves. 35. In assessing the environmental impact of any project, concern is usually shown for its effects on soil, water and air, yet few careful studies are made of its impact on biodiversity, as if the loss of species or animals and plant groups were of little importance. Highways, new plantations, the fencing-off of certain areas, the damming of water sources, and similar developments, crowd out natural habitats and, at times, break them up in such a way that animal populations can no longer migrate or roam freely. As a result, some species face extinction. Alternatives exist which at least lessen the impact of these projects, like the creation of biological corridors, but few countries demonstrate such concern and foresight. Frequently, when certain species are exploited commercially, little attention is paid to studying their reproductive patterns in order to prevent their depletion and the consequent imbalance of the ecosystem. 36. Caring for ecosystems demands far-sightedness, since no one looking for quick and easy profit is truly interested in their preservation. But the cost of the damage caused by such selfish lack of con	ENZYKLIK LAUDATO SI’ DES HEILIGEN VATERS FRANZISKUS ÜBER DIE SORGE FÜR UNSER GEMEINSAMES HAUS	true
1393bc27	"Ich bin mir nicht sicher, ob das Ganze nicht verrückt ist, dieser Klimawandel’ … Umweltschützer James Lovelock in der Nähe seines Hauses an der Küste von Dorset. Foto: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian Fracking ist großartig, die grüne Bewegung ist eine Religion, seine düsteren Vorhersagen zum Klimawandel waren Unsinn – und Robotern macht die Hitze nichts aus, also was macht das schon? Mit 97 ist der Schöpfer der Gaia-Theorie so schelmisch und subversiv wie immer. James Lovelocks Abschiedsworte bei unserem letzten Treffen waren: „Genieße das Leben, solange du kannst. Denn wenn du Glück hast, wird es 20 Jahre dauern, bis es den Fan trifft.“ Es war Anfang 2008, und der angesehene Wissenschaftler sagte eine bevorstehende und unumkehrbare globale Erwärmung voraus, die bald große Teile des Planeten unbewohnbar heiß machen oder unter Wasser setzen würde. Die modische Hoffnung, dass Windparks oder Recycling globale Hungersnöte und Massenmigration verhindern könnten, sei, versicherte er mir, eine Fantasie; Für ethischen Konsum war es zu spät, uns zu retten. Vor dem Ende dieses Jahrhunderts würden 80 % der Weltbevölkerung ausgelöscht werden. Seine Vorhersagen waren nicht leicht zu vergessen oder abzutun. Lovelock wird manchmal als Futurist bezeichnet und ist seit mehr als 50 Jahren Großbritanniens führender unabhängiger Wissenschaftler. Seine Gaia-Hypothese, die besagt, dass die Erde ein einziger, sich selbst regulierender Organismus ist, wird heute als Grundprinzip der meisten Klimawissenschaften akzeptiert, und seine Erfindung eines Geräts zum Nachweis von FCKW half bei der Identifizierung des Lochs in der Ozonschicht. Als trotziger Generalist in einer Ära zunehmend spezialisierter Studien und schelmischer Provokateur wird Lovelock von vielen als wissenschaftliches Genie angesehen. James Lovelock sprach 2014: „Wir sollten es aufgeben, den Planeten zu retten.“ Guardian Acht Jahre nach unserer letzten Begegnung scheint er kein bisschen gealtert zu sein. Mit 97 hat er ein wunderschön illustriertes Essaybuch konzipiert, das als „Werkzeugkasten für die Zukunft“ beschrieben wird, „Die Erde und ich“, und die Einleitung und den Schluss geschrieben; Er geht jeden Tag spazieren, sein Gehör ist perfekt, sein Fokus forensisch und sein Gedächtnis unbeeinträchtigt. ""Ja, warum nicht? Ich schreibe gerade an einem Sachbuch. Es macht riesigen Spaß, weißt du.“ Er wendet seine ganzheitliche Wissenschaftsphilosophie auf seine eigene Gesundheit an. „Ich bin der festen Überzeugung, dass Sie es verlieren, wenn Sie es nicht benutzen – und wenn Sie viel laufen und Ihre Muskeln ziemlich stark beanspruchen, scheint Ihr Gehirn auch zu funktionieren. Man muss das ganze System betrachten, nicht nur Teile davon.“ Was sich jedoch dramatisch geändert hat, ist seine Haltung zum Klimawandel. Heute sagt er: „Jeder, der versucht, mehr als fünf bis zehn Jahre vorherzusagen, ist ein bisschen ein Idiot, weil sich so vieles unerwartet ändern kann.“ Aber hat er nicht genau das getan, als wir uns das letzte Mal getroffen haben? „Ich weiß“, grinst er neckend. „Aber ich bin seitdem ein bisschen erwachsener geworden.“ Lovelock glaubt jetzt, dass „CO2 steigt, aber bei weitem nicht so schnell, wie sie dachten. Die Computermodelle waren einfach nicht zuverlässig. Tatsächlich“, fährt er munter fort, „bin ich mir nicht sicher, ob das Ganze nicht verrückt ist, dieser Klimawandel. Man muss sich nur Singapur anschauen. Es ist zweieinhalb Mal höher als das Worst-Case-Szenario für den Klimawandel, und es ist eine der begehrtesten Städte der Welt zum Leben.“ Es gibt verschiedene mögliche Erklärungen für seinen Sinneswandel. Einer davon ist, dass Lovelock recht hat und die Modelle, auf denen seine früheren Vorhersagen basierten, fatale Mängel aufwiesen. Ein weiterer Grund ist, dass seine ikonoklastische Sensibilität eine Überarbeitung unwiderstehlich machte. Als unverbesserlicher Umstürzler warnte Lovelock die Welt jahrzehntelang vor dem Klimawandel, bevor sie ihn zu beachten begann, und gerade als der wissenschaftliche Konsens begann, ein Eingreifen zu seiner Verhinderung zu fordern, entschied er, dass wir bereits zu spät waren. Aber es gibt eine dritte Erklärung dafür, warum er seine Position wieder geändert hat und sich heute „entspannt in Bezug auf den Klimawandel“ fühlt. Unter sonst gleichen Bedingungen – „und es braucht nur einen großen Vulkan, um auszubrechen, und alle Modelle, alles andere, ist von der Stange“ – erwartet er, dass, bevor die Folgen der globalen Erwärmung uns signifikant treffen können, etwas anderes dies tun wird haben unsere Welt unkenntlich gemacht und bedrohen die Menschheit. Lovelock 1991 mit einem seiner Bücher über die Gaia-Theorie. Lovelock behauptet, dass er im Gegensatz zu den meisten Umweltschützern ein rigoroser Empiriker ist, aber es ist offensichtlich, dass er es genießt, die grüne Bewegung zum Wahnsinn zu bringen. „Nun, es ist wirklich eine Religion, wissen Sie. Das ist völlig unwissenschaftlich.“ Er wurde einmal in den Buckingham Palace eingeladen, wo er Prinzessin Anne sagte: „Dein Bruder hat mich fast umgebracht.“ Nachdem er gelesen hatte, dass Prinz Charles in Highgrove Heizkessel mit Gras installiert hatte, hatte Lovelock einen in seinem Haus ausprobiert. „Es soll schwelen und den Ort warm halten; aber es tut es nicht, denn es geht aus, und Wolken und Rauchwolken kommen heraus.“ Er kichert. „Prinzessin Anne fand das unglaublich lustig.“ Lovelock hatte versucht, seine alte Mühle in Devon, wo er mehr als 35 Jahre lebte, zu heizen, und in einer Werkstatt Geräte erfunden, die einem Doctor-Who-Set ähnelten. Er und seine Frau haben kürzlich ihr Lebenswerk zusammengepackt und sich in ein abgelegenes Cottage am Chesil Beach in Dorset verkleinert, nachdem die Rechnung für die Beheizung der Mühle für nur sechs Monate 6.000 Pfund erreicht hatte. „Ich erinnere mich, dass George Monbiot mich darauf ansprach und schrieb, dass es unmöglich sei, dass ich lügen müsse. Aber ich habe nicht gelogen, ich habe die Zahlen.“ Monbiot beschuldigt ihn fairerweise nicht der Lüge; nur von „Mistreden“ und „wilden Äußerungen“. Auf jeden Fall sagt er, dass er in den USA ein Haus sechs Monate lang bei Temperaturen von -20 ° C (-4 ° F) für nur 60 Pfund heizen konnte. Infolgedessen hat er eine vernichtende Verachtung für den Widerstand von Umweltschützern gegen Fracking. „Sehen Sie, Benzin ist in Amerika wegen Fracking unglaublich billig“, sagt er. Aber wie sieht es mit der Gefahr aus, Erdbeben auszulösen? Er verdreht die Augen. „Klar, das stimmt, es wird eine Steigerung geben. Aber es sind winzig kleine Zittern, sie wären nicht wahrnehmbar. Das einzige Problem ist, dass Sie sie erkennen können. Der Fluch meines Lebens war, dass ich viel Zeit damit verbracht habe, Geräte zu erfinden, die äußerst empfindlich sind. Und in dem Moment, in dem jemand etwas entdecken kann, wird er eine Nummer daran hängen und dann einen Wirbel darum machen.“ Er kichert, hält dann inne. „Ich bin nicht in dem Sinne gegen Grün, dass ich dafür bin, die Welt mit jedem verdammten Ding zu verschmutzen, das wir machen. Ich denke, wir müssen vorsichtig sein. Aber ich fürchte, der menschlichen Natur entsprechend wird die Sache übertrieben und die Grünen haben sich beklagenswert verhalten, anstatt halbwegs vernünftig zu sein.“ Noch ketzerischer als seine Begeisterung für Fracking ist Lovelocks leidenschaftliche Unterstützung der Atomkraft. Aber wie Fracking, sagt er, biete es nur „eine Notlösung“. „Denn langfristig verbrauchen sie das ganze Uran.“ Wie lange würde das dauern? Er hält inne, um ein paar schnelle Kopfrechnen zu machen, so beiläufig, wie ich zählen würde, wie viele Liter Milch ich bei Sainsburys holen soll. „Mal sehen … Ich denke, Uran, das erschwinglich zu extrahieren ist, würde etwa 50 Jahre halten, etwas in diesem Bereich. Es könnten 100 sein. Wenn Sie das alles aufgebraucht haben, gehen Sie zu Thorium, und das würde Sie dreimal so lange halten wie Uran – also, sagen wir, etwa 200 Jahre?“ Die sinnvollste Energielösung wäre, 100 Quadratmeilen der Sahara mit Sonnenkollektoren zu bedecken. „Es würde ganz Europa mit der nötigen Energie versorgen“, aber es werde nicht passieren, „weil es für Terroristen so einfach wäre, loszugehen und es zu vermasseln“. Daher ist die Kernenergie derzeit die einzig gangbare Option. Aber das alles, stellt er fröhlich klar, sei mehr oder weniger akademisch. „Denn ziemlich bald – noch bevor wir das Ende dieses Jahrhunderts erreicht haben – denke ich, dass das, was die Leute Roboter nennen, die Macht übernommen haben wird.“ Roboter werden die Welt regieren? ""Nun ja. Sie werden das Sagen haben.“ Für uns verantwortlich? „Ja, wenn wir noch da sind. Ob sie friedlich übernommen haben oder nicht, keine Ahnung.“ Für Roboter vergeht die Zeit millionenfach schneller als für uns. Das ist in gewisser Weise ziemlich wunderbar, nicht wahr?
Mit dieser Ansicht steht er nicht allein: Der einflussreiche Philosoph Nick Bostrom hat viele Menschen davon überzeugt, dass künstliche Intelligenz eine echte Bedrohung für die Zukunft der Menschheit darstellt; Unter anderem Elon Musk und Stephen Hawking haben dringende Forschung gefordert, um die Risiken zu mindern. Als Lovelock diese Vision skizziert, ist sein Ton jedoch so sachlich, dass ich mich für einen Moment frage, ob er Witze macht. Er ist es nicht. „Wir lassen Computer bereits gerne selbst entwerfen. Das geht jetzt schon seit einiger Zeit so, besonders bei Chips, und es wird nicht lange dauern, bis wir das nicht mehr in der Hand haben, und wir werden beiseite stehen und sagen: 'Nun gut, es macht einen guten Job, sich selbst zu entwerfen, lasst es uns fördern.'“ Computer werden eine unabhängige Willensbildung und Intuition entwickeln („Bis zu einem gewissen Grad haben sie das bereits“) und werden fähig, sich selbst zu reproduzieren und sich weiterzuentwickeln. „Oh ja, das ist entscheidend. Wir werden eine Welt haben, in der Darwin arbeitet.“ Darwinismus funktioniert jetzt nicht? „Oh nein, wir haben den Darwinismus vorübergehend umgedreht. Ich meine, wir bewahren diejenigen auf, die nicht überlebt hätten.“ Lovelock an der University of Houston in Texas im Jahr 1962. Er macht eine Pause und fügt schnell hinzu: „Lassen Sie uns in dieser Sache nicht gefährlich werden. Ich möchte nicht, dass das im Guardian erscheint, dass er nur will, dass alle Dummen und Niederträchtigen ausgelöscht werden.“
Lovelock klingt jedoch nicht im geringsten beunruhigt über die Aussicht, dass Roboter die Macht übernehmen, trotz der Möglichkeit, dass sie uns zerstören werden. „Sobald sie sich irgendwo etabliert haben, ist Schluss, denn für Roboter vergeht die Zeit millionenfach schneller – das ist eine ziemlich genaue Zahl – als für uns. Das ist in gewisser Weise ziemlich wunderbar, nicht wahr?“ Ich bitte ihn, es zu erklären. „Nun, ein Neuron braucht eine Mikrosekunde, um einen Fuß zurückzulegen – was ziemlich schnell ist. Aber bis Elektronen einen Fuß Draht hinuntergehen, dauert es eine Nanosekunde. Es ist eine Million Mal schneller, so einfach ist das. Für einen Roboter, der sich einmal vollständig in dieser neuen Welt etabliert hat, ist eine Sekunde also eine Million Sekunden. Alles geschieht so schnell, dass sie auf der Erde eine Million Mal länger zu leben, aufzuwachsen und sich zu entwickeln haben als wir.“ Es sei möglich, fährt er fort, dass Menschen mit Robotern zu einer Mischung aus Roboter- und menschlichem Gewebe verschmelzen („Das ist ein Weg“), aber das wahrscheinlichere Szenario sind reine Roboter. Warum denkt er, dass wir uns für totale Roboter entscheiden werden? Er wirft mir einen amüsierten Blick zu. „Ich glaube nicht, dass wir das werden. Ich denke, das werden sie – das ist hier das Wichtigste.“ Die Auswirkungen auf den Klimawandel liegen auf der Hand. „Die Welt, in der sie sich wohlfühlen werden, unterscheidet sich stark von der, in der wir uns wohlfühlen. Sobald sie sich also wirklich etabliert haben, werden sie – mit Bedauern – anfangen, organisches Leben zu verlieren.“ Werden sie sich um steigende Temperaturen kümmern? „Die Temperatur wird ihnen keinen Cent ausmachen, denn für sie wird die Änderung langsam sein und sie können eine ziemlich große Änderung ohne viel Aufhebens vertragen. Sie könnten unendlich viel größere Veränderungen durch den Klimawandel bewältigen als wir, bevor es für sie schwierig wird. Es ist wichtig, was die Welt aushält. Sie werden eine sichere Plattform zum Leben haben, also wollen sie nicht, dass Gaia zu sehr durcheinandergebracht wird.“
Ungeachtet seiner Vorbehalte hinsichtlich der Gefahren von Vorhersagen ist sein Vertrauen in die Roboterzukunft, die er beschreibt, „ziemlich hoch. Ja, es kann alles Mögliche passieren, aber das ist das intuitive Gefühl, das ich habe.“ Was unsere Interaktion mit Robotern betrifft: „Nun, es wird sehr eigenartig sein.“ Wird die Menschheit in der klassischen Frankenstein-Tradition nicht verstehen, was sie geschaffen hat, bis es zu spät ist? „Nun, zu spät ist das falsche Wort. Sagen wir, bis es passiert ist.“ Der Ausdruck „zu spät“, erklärt er, impliziert Bedauern – aber während die Roboter vielleicht keine Verwendung für unser Fortbestehen sehen, „haben wir vielleicht eine besondere Eigenschaft, die sie zu schätzen wissen. Aber vergessen Sie nicht, dass sich ihre Zeitskala millionenfach von unserer unterscheidet. Sie hätten große Probleme, mit uns zu sprechen.“ In dem gleichen Sinne, in dem wir Schwierigkeiten haben, mit Ameisen zu sprechen? „Oh nein, es ist noch viel schlimmer. Es ist wirklich eher so, als würden wir mit einem riesigen Mammutbaum sprechen. Und man weiß nie, sie empfinden vielleicht die gleichen Gefühle für uns wie wir für Bäume.“ Vielleicht wollen sie uns sogar umarmen, schlage ich vor? Lovelocks Gesicht leuchtet vor Freude auf. ""Ja genau! Genau. Das ist gut.“ Lovelock war nicht weniger verblüffend fröhlich, als er glaubte, dass der Klimawandel 80 % der Weltbevölkerung auslöschen würde. Wie kann er einer globalen Übernahme durch Roboter jetzt genauso zuversichtlich entgegensehen? „Man könnte sagen: ‚Nun, natürlich ist er so alt, dass er keine Gefühle mehr hat.‘ Stimmt nicht, sage ich!“ Er beharrt darauf, dass er vor 50 Jahren genauso gewesen wäre. “Und ich würde es hassen zu glauben, dass es eine Affektiertheit war.” Als Einzelgänger möchte er lieber nicht bezeichnet werden, denn das lässt ihn wie jemanden klingen, der „Gadgets in seiner Garage herstellt“. „Aber alles im Leben ist für mich nur: ‚Oh, ist das nicht interessant?‘“"	James Lovelock: „Vor dem Ende dieses Jahrhunderts werden Roboter übernommen haben“	partially false
03a10122	"KORREKTUR: Dieser Artikel wurde aktualisiert, um darauf hinzuweisen, dass andere Brandbekämpfungsmaßnahmen, die es den Wäldern ermöglichen, Anzündholz anzusammeln, älter waren als die Regeln des damaligen Präsidenten Bill Clinton. Es wurde auch aktualisiert, um Argumente aufzunehmen, dass der Klimawandel die Schwere von Waldbränden im Westen erhöht. Darüber hinaus wurde in einer früheren Version dieses Artikels angegeben, dass zwischen 1960 und 1990 jedes Jahr durchschnittlich 10 Millionen Fuß Holz von Forstdienstflächen entfernt wurden. Die tatsächliche Zahl betrug 10,3 Milliarden. Der Artikel wurde aktualisiert, um die Änderung widerzuspiegeln. Dieser Beitrag wurde auch aktualisiert, um klarzustellen, dass Waldbrandbrennstoffe wie Unterholz nach Clintons Northwest Forest Plan zugenommen haben, obwohl die Abholzung in einigen Fällen das Risiko von Waldbränden erhöhen kann. Diesem Beitrag wurde auch ein Zitat aus einer Studie hinzugefügt, in der festgestellt wurde, dass der Plan nicht mit der Bewirtschaftung von Wäldern mit häufigen Bränden vereinbar war. Die Landbewirtschaftungsregeln des ehemaligen Präsidenten Bill Clinton und andere liberale Richtlinien ebneten den Weg für zukünftige schwächende Waldbrände, sagte der Brandexperte Bob Zybach gegenüber der Daily Caller News Foundation. Zybach warnte vor möglichen katastrophalen Waldbränden, kurz nachdem Clinton Mitte der 1990er Jahre eine Reihe von Vorschriften unterzeichnet hatte, die laut einer 2019 in der Ecological Society of America veröffentlichten Studie „nicht mit der Bewirtschaftung von … historisch feuerhäufigen Wäldern vereinbar“ waren. Zybachs Kommentare kommen, als Kalifornien, Oregon und Teile von Washington mit katastrophalen Waldbränden zu kämpfen haben, die 26 Menschen getötet und Gebäude zerstört haben.
Der frühere Präsident Bill Clinton hat vor fast 30 Jahren eine bedeutende Änderung an der föderalen Landbewirtschaftung vorgenommen, die die Bedingungen geschaffen hat, die notwendig sind, um die Schwere der Waldbrände an der Westküste zu erhöhen, so ein Brandexperte, der das Problem vor Jahren vorhergesagt hat.
Kurz vor seinem Ausscheiden aus dem Amt im Jahr 2001 beschränkte Clinton die Möglichkeiten des United States Forest Service, ein dichtes Dickicht aus Laub und umgestürzten Bäumen auf Bundesland auszudünnen, um den Westen in einen unberührten Zustand zu bringen, Bob Zybach, ein erfahrener Förster mit einem Doktortitel in Umweltwissenschaft, sagte der Daily Caller News Foundation. Die Entscheidung des ehemaligen Präsidenten habe eine tickende Zeitbombe geschaffen, argumentiert Zybach.
„Wenn Sie nicht anfangen, diese Wälder zu bewirtschaften, werden sie anfangen zu verbrennen. Dreißig Jahre später ignorieren sie es immer noch“, sagte Zybach, der mehr als 20 Jahre als Wiederaufforstungsunternehmer tätig war. Er bezog sich auf Warnungen, die er vor Jahren ausgesprochen hatte, als er Beamten mitteilte, dass die Abwehr vorgeschriebener Verbrennungen in Oregon und Kalifornien entzündende Feuer erzeugt. Solche Regeln erschweren es, vorgeschriebene Verbrennungen durchzuführen, bei denen es sich um kontrollierte Verbrennungen handelt, die darauf abzielen, das gesamte Unterholz in Wäldern zu entfernen, um die Wahrscheinlichkeit massiver Brände zu verringern, stellte Zybach fest. Jahrelange Bewahrung dieser Gebiete in ihrem natürlichen Zustand führt dazu, dass sich tote Bäume und getrocknetes organisches Material auf dem Waldboden absetzen und dieses Material in Trockenzeiten in Streichhölzer verwandeln, die in Kerosin getränkt sind, sagte er.
Zybachs Kommentare kommen, während Waldbrände weiterhin durch Teile von Kalifornien, Oregon und Washington wüten, wie Medienberichte zeigen. Brände haben seit August 26 Menschen in den Westküstenstaaten getötet, darunter 19 Menschen in Kalifornien, und dazu geführt, dass mehr als eine halbe Million Menschen Oregon evakuiert haben, eine Zahl, die etwa 10 % der Gesamtbevölkerung des Staates ausmacht.
Rund 100 massive Brände lodern am Samstag im Westen, darunter 12 in Idaho und neun in Montana, teilte das National Interagency Fire Center am Samstag mit. Alles in allem haben die Waldbrände mehr als 4,5 Millionen Morgen in 12 Bundesstaaten durchwühlt. (VERBUNDEN: Waldbrände, Stromausfälle und hohe Gaspreise: Kalifornier kämpfen gegen vertraute Feinde inmitten einer Pandemie) Kurz vor seinem Ausscheiden aus dem Amt führte Clinton die Roadless Rule ein, die die Nutzung bestehender Straßen und den Bau neuer Straßen auf 49 Millionen Morgen National Forest einschränkte schwierig für Beamte, das Land nach der Art von Zündholz abzusuchen, das massive Feuersbrände anheizt.
Der Umzug war laut der New York Times Teil des Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP), einer Resolution, die Clinton 1994 angenommen hatte, um anhaltende Streitigkeiten zwischen Wirtschafts- und Umweltinteressen beizulegen. Der Plan sollte bestimmte Teile der Wälder schützen, während andere abgeholzt werden konnten. Laut einer 2019 in der Ecological Study of America veröffentlichten Studie war der Plan jedoch „unvereinbar mit der Bewirtschaftung der ökologischen Integrität in den trockenen, historisch von Bränden häufigen Wäldern“, die Teile der geschützten Wälder ausmachen. die zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts begannen, haben laut The Guardian dazu geführt, dass sich Anzündholz in Wäldern angesammelt hat.
Zehn Jahre vor Clintons Herrschaft setzte der Fish and Wildlife Service die nördliche gefleckte Eule in das Endangered Species Act und zwang den Forest Service, eine neue Politik zu verabschieden, die zu einer stärkeren Reduzierung der Holzernte führte. Laut Daten, die 2015 von der Reason Foundation gesammelt wurden, ist die Menge an Holz, die aus Bundesländern entfernt wurde, stark zurückgegangen. Die Daten zeigen, dass zwischen 1960 und 1990 jedes Jahr durchschnittlich 10,3 Milliarden Fuß Holz vom Land des Forest Service entfernt wurden. Diese Zahlen gingen zwischen 1991 und 2000 zurück und gingen weiter zurück – den Daten zufolge wurden zwischen 2000 und 2013 durchschnittlich nur 2,1 Milliarden Fuß Holz vom Land entfernt. Das ist ein Rückgang von 80 %.
Und während Holzeinschlag eine ineffektive Methode zur Verhinderung von Waldbränden sein kann und in einigen Fällen laut BBC zu einer Zunahme führen kann, berichtete die Times, dass nach dem Northwest Forest Plan das Risiko von Waldbränden zusammen mit Brennstoffen wie brennbaren Bäumen und Unterholz zunahm . Laut der Studie der Ecological Society of America würden Maßnahmen wie „Ausdünnung und vorgeschriebenes Feuer zur Verringerung der Brennstoffkontinuität“ die „ökologische Integrität“ in bestimmten Teilen der Wälder fördern, die im Rahmen des Plans geschützt sind.
„Sie sind gegangen und haben Hunderttausende Morgen verbranntes Holz zurückgelassen, eine Feuerbombe, die darauf wartet, dass sie passiert, die an Ort und Stelle stehen, weil der Schwarzrückenspecht diesen Lebensraum bevorzugt“, sagte Zybach. „Das ist großartig für Anwälte, aber schlecht für Menschen, die Luft atmen oder im Wald arbeiten.“ „Die vorgeschriebenen Verbrennungen sind eine alte Form des Managements, um die Brennstoffe niedrig zu halten, damit diese Ereignisse nicht passieren“, fügte Zybach hinzu und bezog sich auf die amerikanischen Ureinwohner, die kontrollierte Verbrennungen verwendeten, um Schädlinge abzuwehren und zu verhindern, dass Waldbrände ihre Häuser auslecken. Der Plan der Clinton-Regierung, die Wälder im Westen in unberührtes Land ohne menschliche Eingriffe zu verwandeln, riskierte, „Waldbrände zu schüren, die an den Tillamook-Feuer, die Brände von 1910 und den Yellowstone-Feuer erinnern“, sagte Zybach, der in Oregon ansässig ist, 1994 gegenüber der Zeitschrift Evergreen. als das NWFP in Kraft trat.
West-Oregon hatte zwischen 1952 und 1987 einen Großbrand über 10.000 Acres, wie Berichte zeigen. Das Silver Complex Fire von 1987 brach diesen Streifen ab, nachdem es mehr als 100.000 Morgen im Kalmiopsis Wilderness-Gebiet in Brand gesteckt und seltene Pflanzen und Bäume getötet hatte, die die Bundesregierung vor menschlichen Aktivitäten schützen wollte.
Und das Feuer im Mendocino-Komplex breitet sich über ganz Kalifornien aus und ist auf dem Weg, das größte Lauffeuer des Bundesstaates zu werden, das mehr als 283.000 Morgen verschlingt.
Zybach sagte, er glaube, dass die Landbewirtschaftung und nicht der Klimawandel die Schwere der Waldbrände im Westen verschärfe, und stellte fest, dass der Klimawandel wenig mit der Ansammlung von Anzündholz auf Waldböden zu tun habe.
Der Klimawissenschaftler Cliff Mass von der University of Washington sagte dem DCNF im Jahr 2018, dass „die Schlüsselfaktoren schlecht bewirtschaftete Wälder, jahrelange Brandbekämpfung, wachsende Bevölkerung, Menschen, die dort leben, wo sie nicht leben sollten, invasive brennbare Arten und die Tatsache, dass es in Kalifornien schon immer Feuer gegeben hat. ” Andere Wissenschaftler sagen jedoch, dass der Klimawandel die treibende Ursache ist, da die Sommerhitze zunimmt und totes Gestrüpp auf Waldböden weiter austrocknet.
Die Washington Post berichtete, dass der Westen heißer, trockener und anfälliger für große Flammen wird. Es wies auch auf eine August-Studie hin, die herausfand, dass sich die Herbsttage in Kalifornien mit extremen Feuerwetterbedingungen seit den 1980er Jahren mehr als verdoppelt hatten.
„Ich kann nicht sagen, dass es unerwartet war, was dort passiert ist, aber die Geschwindigkeit, mit der es ging, war für viele von uns überwältigend“, sagte ein Forschungsökologe des U.S. Forest Service, Eric Knapp, der Post und bezog sich auf das Creek Fire . Laut der Post erhöhte der Klimawandel die Wahrscheinlichkeit und Schwere einer Dürre, die Bäume vor dem Brand in dieser Region tötete.
In der Zwischenzeit twitterte der ehemalige Präsident Barack Obama: „Die Brände an der Westküste sind nur die jüngsten Beispiele dafür, wie unser sich änderndes Klima unsere Gemeinden verändert.“
In ähnlicher Weise twitterte der Mehrheitsführer des Senats, Chuck Schumer: „Der Beweis für die Dringlichkeit der Klimakrise liegt buchstäblich in der Luft um uns herum.“ Der New Yorker Demokrat fügte einen Link zu einem Artikel von CBS vom 10. September hinzu, in dem der Klimawandel für die Brände verantwortlich gemacht wird.
Brandexperten sind sich einig: Vorgeschriebene Verbrennungen sind kritisch, sagen Experten
Laut Tim Ingalsbee, einem Feuerökologen, der in den 1980er Jahren eine Karriere als Feuerwehrmann in der Wildnis begann, tragen übereifrige Brandbekämpfungen in ganz Kalifornien dazu bei, Brennstoffe in der Wildnis aufzubauen, die zu Waldbränden beitragen. Die Lösung besteht darin, „gutes Feuer auf den Boden zu bringen und einen Teil dieser Treibstoffladung zu verringern“, sagte er ProPublica im August.
„Es ist nur … na ja … es ist schrecklich. Es ist schrecklich zu sehen, dass dies geschieht, wenn die Wissenschaft so klar ist und seit Jahren klar ist. Ich leide am Kassandra-Syndrom“, sagte Ingalsbee und bezog sich auf eine griechische Metapher, die Menschen verwenden, wenn sie glauben, dass ihre gültigen Warnungen ignoriert werden.
„Jedes Jahr warne ich die Menschen: Die Katastrophe kommt“, sagte er. „Wir müssen uns ändern. Und niemand hört zu. Und dann passiert es.“
Andere Experten haben in der Vergangenheit ähnliche Argumente vorgebracht. (VERBINDUNG: Jahrzehntelanges Missmanagement verwandelte US-Wälder in „Zeitlupen-Zeitbomben“)
Ein US-Forstfeuerwehrmann kühlt ein brennendes modulares Haus, um ein nahe gelegenes Gebäude im Deerhorn Valley zu schützen, während das Harris Fire am 24. Oktober 2007 in der Nähe von Jamul, Kalifornien, über 70.000 Morgen hinauswächst. Südkalifornien wird von zahlreichen Rekord-Waldbränden heimgesucht, da die Windbedingungen von Santa Ana sie in Gemeinden drängen, die von einheimischem Chaparral-Lebensraum umgeben sind, der durch die trockenste Regenzeit seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen vor 130 Jahren ausgetrocknet wurde. Die Brände entwickeln sich zum schlimmsten Waldbrandereignis in der Geschichte von San Diego County. Bis zu 500.000 Menschen wurden aus ihren Häusern evakuiert.
Überwuchertes Grasland, Wälder und Wälder trugen 2017 zu den Waldbränden in Kalifornien bei, sagte Sasha Berleman, eine Feuerökologin, in jenem Jahr gegenüber High Country News.
„Ich bin mir sicherer denn je, dass wir bis zum nächsten Mal, wenn dies passiert, viel tun können, damit die negativen Folgen für die Menschen bei weitem nicht so dramatisch sind“, sagte sie.
Die verheerenden Brände, die im Oktober 2017 durch das kalifornische Weinland wüteten, töteten 42 Menschen und zerstörten fast 7.000 Gebäude, stellte High Country News fest.
Die Lösung ist vielleicht leichter gesagt als getan. Fast 20 Millionen Morgen in Kalifornien oder ein Gebiet von der Größe von Maine müssen kontrollierten Verbrennungen ausgesetzt werden, um katastrophale Waldbrände zu begrenzen, so eine Studie von Nature Sustainability vom Januar."

917ea895	"Klimawandel: Wie 1,5 °C die Welt verändern könnten Es ist der letzte Aufruf, sagen Wissenschaftler, in der bisher umfassendsten Warnung vor den Risiken steigender globaler Temperaturen. Ihr dramatischer Bericht darüber, diesen Anstieg unter 1,5 °C zu halten, besagt, dass die Welt jetzt völlig vom Kurs abgekommen ist und sich stattdessen auf 3 °C zubewegt. Die Einhaltung des bevorzugten Ziels von 1,5 °C über dem vorindustriellen Niveau wird „schnelle, weitreichende und beispiellose Veränderungen in allen Aspekten der Gesellschaft“ bedeuten. Es wird enorm teuer – aber das Zeitfenster bleibt offen.
Nach drei Jahren der Forschung und einer Woche des Feilschens zwischen Wissenschaftlern und Regierungsbeamten bei einem Treffen in Südkorea hat der Weltklimarat (IPCC) einen Sonderbericht über die Auswirkungen der globalen Erwärmung um 1,5 °C herausgegeben. Was könnte durch den Temperaturanstieg ausgelöscht werden? Was ist der Klimawandel? Die kritische 33-seitige Zusammenfassung für politische Entscheidungsträger trägt sicherlich die Kennzeichen schwieriger Verhandlungen zwischen Klimaforschern, die entschlossen sind, an dem festzuhalten, was ihre Studien gezeigt haben, und politischen Vertretern, die sich mehr um Wirtschaft und Lebensstandard sorgen. Trotz der unvermeidlichen Kompromisse gibt es einige Schlüsselbotschaften, die laut und deutlich durchdringen. „Der erste ist, dass die Begrenzung der Erwärmung auf 1,5 °C viele Vorteile mit sich bringt, verglichen mit einer Begrenzung auf zwei Grad. Es verringert wirklich die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels auf sehr wichtige Weise“, sagte Prof. Jim Skea, Mitvorsitzender des IPCC. „Der zweite ist die beispiellose Art der Änderungen, die erforderlich sind, wenn wir die Erwärmung auf 1,5 °C begrenzen wollen – Änderungen an Energiesystemen, Änderungen in der Art und Weise, wie wir Land bewirtschaften, Änderungen in der Art und Weise, wie wir uns mit Transportmitteln fortbewegen.“ Was ist der eine große Vorteil Grafik, die zeigt, was wahrscheinlich von unterschiedlichen Temperaturanstiegen beeinflusst wird Präsentations-Leerraum „Wissenschaftler möchten vielleicht in Großbuchstaben schreiben: ‚HANDELN SIE JETZT, IDIOTEN‘, aber sie müssen dies mit Fakten und Zahlen sagen.“ sagte Kaisa Kosonen von Greenpeace, die Beobachterin bei den Verhandlungen war. ""Und das haben sie."" Die Forscher haben diese Fakten und Zahlen verwendet, um ein Bild von der Welt mit einem gefährlichen Fieber zu zeichnen, das von Menschen verursacht wird. Früher dachten wir, wenn wir die Erwärmung in diesem Jahrhundert unter zwei Grad halten könnten, wären die Veränderungen, die wir erleben würden, beherrschbar. Nicht mehr. Diese neue Studie besagt, dass das Überschreiten von 1,5 ° C die Bewohnbarkeit des Planeten beeinträchtigt. Und die „Leitplanke“ der Temperatur von 1,5 °C könnte in nur 12 Jahren, im Jahr 2030, überschritten werden. Wir können darunter bleiben – aber es erfordert dringende, groß angelegte Änderungen von Regierungen und Einzelpersonen, und wir müssen einen riesigen Haufen davon investieren Bargeld jedes Jahr, etwa 2,5 % des globalen Bruttoinlandsprodukts (BIP), dem Wert aller produzierten Waren und Dienstleistungen, für zwei Jahrzehnte. Auch dann werden wir noch Maschinen, Bäume und Pflanzen brauchen, um Kohlenstoff aus der Luft zu binden, den wir dann tief unter der Erde speichern können – für immer.
Was kann ich tun? Kein Rindfleisch mehr? Fünf Dinge, die Sie tun können, um den globalen Temperaturanstieg zu stoppen Der Bericht besagt, dass es in vier großen globalen Systemen zu schnellen und signifikanten Veränderungen kommen muss: Energie • Landnutzung • Städte • Industrie. die Menschen auffordern, weniger Fleisch, Milch, Käse und Butter und mehr saisonale Lebensmittel aus der Region zu kaufen – und weniger davon wegzuwerfen • Elektroautos zu fahren, aber kurze Strecken zu Fuß oder mit dem Fahrrad zu fahren • Züge und Busse statt Flugzeuge zu nehmen • Videokonferenzen statt Geschäfte zu nutzen reisen • eine Wäscheleine anstelle eines Wäschetrockners verwenden • Häuser isolieren • kohlenstoffarmes Konsumprodukt fordern Änderungen des Lebensstils können einen großen Unterschied machen, sagte Dr. Debra Roberts, die andere Co-Vorsitzende des IPCC. „Das ist eine sehr ermutigende Botschaft für den Einzelnen“, sagte sie. „Hier geht es nicht um entfernte Wissenschaft; es geht darum, wo wir leben und arbeiten, und es gibt uns einen Hinweis darauf, wie wir möglicherweise zu dieser massiven Veränderung beitragen können, weil jeder beteiligt sein muss.“
„Man könnte sagen, man hat keine Kontrolle über die Landnutzung, aber man hat die Kontrolle darüber, was man isst, und das bestimmt die Landnutzung.“ „Wir können wählen, wie wir uns in Städten fortbewegen und ob wir keinen Zugang zu öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln haben - Stellen Sie sicher, dass Sie Politiker wählen, die Optionen rund um den öffentlichen Verkehr anbieten."" Der heißeste Ort, den es je gegeben hat ... Karte, die zeigt, wo in diesem Sommer weltweit Temperaturrekorde gebrochen wurden Präsentationsgraue Linie Fünf Schritte zu 1,5 globalen CO2-Emissionen erforderlich bis 2030 um 45 % gegenüber dem Stand von 2010 zurückgehen Erneuerbare Energien sollen bis 2050 schätzungsweise bis zu 85 % des weltweiten Stroms liefern Kohle wird voraussichtlich auf nahezu null zurückgehen Bis zu sieben Millionen Quadratkilometer Land werden für Energiepflanzen benötigt (etwas weniger als die Größe Australiens) Globale Netto-Null-Emissionen bis 2050 Darstellungsgraue Linie Wie viel wird das alles kosten? Es wird nicht billig sein. Der Bericht besagt, dass die Begrenzung der Erwärmung auf 1,5 °C einen „durchschnittlichen jährlichen Investitionsbedarf in Energie“ beinhalten wird System von rund 2 $. 4 Billionen“ zwischen 2016 und 2035. Experten glauben, dass diese Zahl relativiert werden muss. „Es gibt Kosten und Nutzen, die man abwägen muss“, sagte Dr. Stephen Cornelius, ein ehemaliger britischer IPCC-Unterhändler, jetzt beim WWF. Er sagt, dass kurzfristige große Emissionssenkungen Geld kosten werden, aber billiger sind, als später in diesem Jahrhundert für die Entfernung von Kohlendioxid zu zahlen. „Der Bericht spricht auch über die Vorteile, da das Wirtschaftswachstum bei 1,5 Grad höher ist als bei 2 ° C und Sie bei 1,5 nicht das höhere Risiko katastrophaler Auswirkungen haben als bei zwei.“
Fünf Dinge, die wir aus dem Bericht gelernt haben Fast Fashion schadet dem Planeten, sagen Abgeordnete Vietnams Kinder und die Angst vor dem Klimawandel Vergleich der Jahre mit dem Durchschnitt des 20. Jahrhunderts 2019 10 wärmste Jahre10 kälteste Jahre Was passiert, wenn wir nicht handeln?
Die Forscher sagen, dass wir einige bedeutende und gefährliche Veränderungen in unserer Welt erleben werden, wenn wir den Temperaturanstieg nicht unter 1,5 ° C halten. Sie können sich von Korallenriffen verabschieden, da der Bericht besagt, dass sie bei zwei Grad Erwärmung im Wesentlichen zu 100% ausgelöscht würden. Der globale Meeresspiegel wird um etwa 10 cm (4 Zoll) weiter steigen, wenn wir die Erwärmung auf 2 °C belassen. Das mag nicht nach viel klingen, aber die Einhaltung von 1,5 °C bedeutet, dass 10 Millionen Menschen weniger Hochwasserrisiken ausgesetzt wären. Es gibt auch erhebliche Auswirkungen auf die Meerestemperaturen und den Säuregehalt sowie auf die Fähigkeit, Feldfrüchte wie Reis, Mais und Weizen anzubauen. „Wir sind schon bei einem Grad Erwärmung in der Gefahrenzone“, sagte Kaisa Kosonen von Greenpeace. „Beide Pole schmelzen mit beschleunigter Geschwindigkeit; alte Bäume, die dort seit Hunderten von Jahren stehen, sterben plötzlich ab; und der Sommer, den wir gerade erlebt haben – im Grunde stand die ganze Welt in Flammen.“ 1980 betrug die minimale Meereisausdehnung 7,7 Millionen Quadratkilometer. In diesem Jahr waren es 4,7 Millionen Quadratkilometer. 2012 war das niedrigste Jahr seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen, als es auf 3,6 Millionen Quadratkilometer zurückging – weniger als die Hälfte dessen, was es 1980 war. Die Meereisausdehnung ist viel geringer als 1980 niedrigstes Niveau 2012 Repräsentative graue Linie Ist dieser Plan überhaupt realisierbar? Analyse von David Shukman, Wissenschaftsredakteur der BBC Der Countdown zum Schlimmsten der globalen Erwärmung scheint sich beschleunigt zu haben. Ernsthaft schädliche Auswirkungen sind später in diesem Jahrhundert nicht mehr in weiter Ferne, sondern in einem Zeitrahmen, der unangenehm nahe erscheint. Aus dem gleichen Grund bedeuten die „Wege“ des Berichts, um die Temperaturen unter Kontrolle zu halten, dass harte Entscheidungen nicht aufgeschoben werden können: Eine Abkehr von fossilen Brennstoffen durch den Kohleausstieg Mitte des Jahrhunderts viel früher als zuvor vorgeschlagen, große Landstriche wurden übergeben Wälder Es ist verblüffendes Zeug und einige werden sagen, es sei hoffnungslos unrealistisch, eine Fantasie der Klimawissenschaftler. Ist irgendetwas davon plausibel? Einerseits ist die Weltwirtschaft auf Kohlenstoff angewiesen und wichtige Aktivitäten hängen davon ab. Andererseits sind Windkraftanlagen und Solarmodule im Preis gefallen und immer mehr Länder und Staaten wie Kalifornien setzen sich ehrgeizige grüne Ziele. Letztlich stehen die Politiker vor einer schwierigen Entscheidung: Sie müssen ihre Wähler davon überzeugen, dass die im Bericht skizzierte revolutionäre Änderung dringend erforderlich ist, oder sie ignorieren und behaupten, die Wissenschaftler hätten einen Fehler gemacht. Geht es hier um die Rettung kleiner Inselstaaten? Die Idee, den globalen Temperaturanstieg auf 1,5 zu begrenzen, liegt den kleinen Insel- und Tieflandstaaten sehr am Herzen, die befürchten, von Überschwemmungen überschwemmt zu werden, wenn die Temperaturen auf zwei Grad sinken. Aber in den drei Jahren, in denen der Bericht erstellt wurde, wurden immer mehr wissenschaftliche Beweise veröffentlicht, die zeigen, dass die Vorteile einer Beibehaltung der Temperatur nahe 1,5 °C nicht nur für Inselstaaten im Pazifik von Vorteil sind. „Wenn Sie einen kleinen Inselstaat retten, dann retten Sie die Welt“, sagte Dr. Amjad Abdulla, ein IPCC-Autor von den Malediven. „Weil der Bericht klar sagt, dass niemand immun sein wird. Es geht um Moral – es geht um Menschlichkeit.“ Wie lange haben wir noch? Gar nicht lange. Aber dieses Thema liegt jetzt in den Händen der politischen Führer. Der Bericht sagt, dass harte Entscheidungen nicht mehr auf die Straße getreten werden können. Wenn die Nationen der Welt nicht bald handeln, müssen sie sich noch mehr auf unerprobte Technologien verlassen, um Kohlenstoff aus der Luft zu entfernen – ein teurer und unsicherer Weg. „Sie müssen wirklich sofort mit der Arbeit beginnen. Der Bericht macht deutlich, dass es nicht gut genug ist, wenn die Regierungen nur die Zusagen erfüllen, die sie im Pariser Abkommen für 2030 gemacht haben. Es wird es sehr schwierig machen, eine globale Erwärmung von 1,5 °C in Betracht zu ziehen.“ sagte Prof. Jim Skea. „Wenn sie den Bericht lesen und beschließen, ihre Ambitionen zu steigern und sofort zu handeln, bleiben 1,5 °C in Reichweite – das ist die Art der Wahl, vor der sie stehen.“ Aktivisten und Umweltschützer, die den Bericht begrüßt haben, sagen, es sei einfach keine Zeit mehr für eine Debatte. ""Das ist der Moment, in dem wir uns entscheiden müssen"", sagte Kaisa Kosonen. „Wir wollen zu sauberer Energie und nachhaltigen Lebensstilen übergehen. Wir wollen unsere Wälder und Arten schützen. Dies ist der Moment, an den wir uns erinnern werden; dies ist das Jahr, in dem der Wendepunkt passiert ist.“"	Letzter Aufruf zur Rettung der Welt vor der „Klimakatastrophe“	partially false
3a90d9c8	"Das dramatische Abschmelzen des arktischen Eises führt bereits zu extremen Wetterbedingungen, die Hunderte Millionen Menschen in Nordamerika, Europa und Asien betreffen, sagten führende Klimawissenschaftler gegenüber dem Guardian.
Schwere „Snowmageddon“-Winter sind jetzt stark mit steigenden Polartemperaturen verbunden, sagen Forscher, wobei tödliche Hitzewellen im Sommer und sintflutartige Überschwemmungen wahrscheinlich ebenfalls damit zusammenhängen. Die Wissenschaftler befürchten nun, dass die arktische Kernschmelze abrupte Veränderungen in der wirbelnden Atmosphäre des Planeten ausgelöst und extremes Wetter in dicht besiedelten Gebieten zum Kochen gebracht hat. Die nördliche Eiskappe schrumpft seit den 1970er Jahren, wobei die globale Erwärmung bisher zu einem Verlust von etwa drei Vierteln ihres Volumens geführt hat. Aber die jüngste Hitze in der Arktis hat Wissenschaftler schockiert, mit Temperaturen, die in Teilen der russischen Arktis 33 ° C über dem Durchschnitt liegen und an einigen anderen Orten 20 ° C höher sind. Im November erreichte der Eisspiegel ein Rekordtief, und wir befinden uns jetzt auf „unerforschtem Territorium“, sagte Prof. Jennifer Francis, eine Expertin für arktisches Klima an der Rutgers University in den USA, die sich erstmals für die Region interessierte, als sie mit einem durch sie hindurchsegelte Weltreise in den 1980er Jahren. „Diese schnellen Veränderungen in der Arktis beeinflussen die Wettermuster dort, wo Sie gerade leben“, sagte sie. „In der Vergangenheit gab es natürliche Schwankungen wie El Niño, aber sie sind in Kombination mit dieser sehr warmen Arktis noch nie aufgetreten, also ist es ein ganz neues Ballspiel. „Es ist unvorstellbar, dass diese lächerlich warme Arktis keinen Einfluss auf die Wettermuster in den mittleren Breiten weiter südlich hat, wo so viele Menschen leben. „Man kann mit Sicherheit sagen, dass [die heiße Arktis] einen großen Einfluss haben wird, aber es ist derzeit schwer zu sagen, wie groß genau. Aber wir werden sehr interessantes Wetter haben – daran kommen wir nicht vorbei.“ Die Fläche, die von mindestens vier Jahre altem arktischem Meereis bedeckt ist, hat sich von 718.000 Quadratmeilen im September 1984 auf 42.000 Quadratmeilen im September 2016 verringert. Älteres Eis neigt dazu, weniger anfällig für Schmelzen zu sein. Das Alter des Eises wird durch Schattierungen angezeigt, die von blaugrau für das jüngste Eis bis zu weiß für das älteste Eis reichen. Credits: Nasa Die Kette von Ereignissen, die die schmelzende Arktis mit dem Wetter im Süden verbindet, beginnt mit steigenden globalen Temperaturen, die dazu führen, dass mehr Meereis schmilzt. Anders als auf dem antarktischen Kontinent legt das schmelzende Eis hier den dunklen Ozean darunter frei, der mehr Sonnenlicht absorbiert als Eis und sich weiter erwärmt. Diese Rückkopplungsschleife ist der Grund, warum sich die Arktis viel schneller aufheizt als der Rest des Planeten.
Dies verringert wiederum den Temperaturunterschied zwischen der Arktis und den unteren Breiten, was entscheidend ist, da es das Temperaturgefälle zwischen ihnen ist, das den Jetstream-Wind antreibt, der mit bis zu 400 km/h und etwa 8 km über der Oberfläche um den Pol streicht. Der Jetstream bildet eine Grenze zwischen dem kalten Norden und dem wärmeren Süden, aber der geringere Temperaturunterschied bedeutet, dass die Winde jetzt schwächer sind. Dies bedeutet, dass der Jetstream stärker mäandriert, wobei große Schleifen warme Luft in den gefrorenen Norden und kalte Luft in wärmere südliche Gefilde bringen. Darüber hinaus, sagen die Forscher, bedeuten die Änderungen, dass die Schleifen wochenlang über Regionen stecken bleiben können, anstatt wie in der Vergangenheit nach Westen geblasen zu werden. Dieser „blockierende“ Effekt ermöglicht die Entfaltung von Extremereignissen.
„Es gibt neuere Studien, die sehr plausible physikalische Mechanismen zeigen, wie die schnelle Erwärmung in der Arktis das Wetter in den mittleren Breiten beeinflussen kann, sowohl im Sommer als auch im Winter“, sagte Dim Coumou vom Potsdam-Institut für Klimafolgenforschung in Deutschland. Coumou ist ein ehemaliger Geophysiker der Offshore-Industrie, der seit 2010 den Zusammenhang zwischen extremen Wetterereignissen und der globalen Erwärmung untersucht. „Vor ein paar Jahren war dies die Hauptkritik an solchen Zusammenhängen, dass die Physik nicht gut verstanden wurde“, sagte er. „Aber die große Frage [jetzt] ist, wie wichtig sind diese Mechanismen?“ Der andere Haupteinfluss auf den Jetstream ist die Meeresoberflächentemperatur in den Tropen, die mit El Niño zu- und abnimmt, während Sonnenzyklen und sogar Vulkanausbrüche geringere Auswirkungen haben. Die bisher deutlichste Verbindung zwischen der schmelzenden Arktis und dem Wetter besteht bei extremen Winterbedingungen, wie den intensiven Wintern, die Teile Nordamerikas und Nordeuropas in den Jahren 2009-10, 2010-11 und 2013-14 heimsuchten und Rekordschneefälle und Milliarden von Schneefällen verursachten Dollar Schaden. In jenen Jahren lenkte der Jetstream über diesen Regionen tief nach Süden ab und zog brutal kalte Luft herunter. Prof. Adam Scaife, Experte für Klimamodellierung beim britischen Met Office, sagte, die Beweise für einen Zusammenhang mit dem Schrumpfen des arktischen Eises seien jetzt gut: „Der Konsens deutet darauf hin, dass dies ein echter Effekt ist.“ Während Abschwünge des Jetstreams eiskalte Winter bringen können, wurden die damit einhergehenden Aufschwünge mit einer Verschlechterung der Dürre in Kalifornien in Verbindung gebracht. „Diese Schwankungen des Jetstreams nach Norden sind natürlich der Grund, warum Kalifornien eine so schreckliche Dürre hat“, sagte Francis. Dieser Effekt wurde bereits 2004 vorhergesagt, und die Forscher sagten jetzt: „Die Realität bewegt sich schneller, als wir dachten oder hofften.“
Aber die Winterextreme können auch in die andere Richtung schwingen und mildes, aber sintflutartiges Wetter bringen, wie es in den letzten beiden Wintern in Großbritannien zu beobachten war, was zu schweren Überschwemmungen führen kann, sagte Prof. Edward Hanna von der Universität Sheffield in Großbritannien.
150 Jahre globale Erwärmung in einer minutenlangen Symphonie Guardian Er wies auf die Nordatlantische Oszillation (NAO) hin, eine zyklische Schwankung des Luftdrucks, die durch das schnelle Schmelzen des arktischen Eises beeinflusst werden könnte. Die Variabilität des NOA habe sich im letzten Jahrhundert verdoppelt, sagte er: „Innerhalb des letzten Jahrzehnts gab es im Dezember wilde Schwankungen bei den NAO-Werten.“ Der Zusammenhang zwischen dem schwindenden arktischen Eis und extremem Sommerwetter auf der Nordhalbkugel ist laut Wissenschaftlern wahrscheinlich, aber noch nicht so sicher wie der Zusammenhang im Winter. Blockierungsmuster, die durch sich langsam bewegende Mäander des Jetstreams verursacht wurden, wurden fest mit einigen verheerenden Ereignissen in Verbindung gebracht, darunter die Überschwemmungen im Sommer 2010 in Pakistan, bei denen 2.000 Menschen ums Leben kamen und 20 Millionen Menschen in Mitleidenschaft gezogen wurden, sowie die sengende Hitzewelle in Russland im selben Jahr. der 50.000 Menschen tötete und Ernten im Wert von 15 Milliarden Dollar (12 Milliarden Pfund) vernichtete. Dorfbewohner stehen während Sturzfluten am Stadtrand von Peschawar, Pakistan, im April 2016 vor ihren Häusern
„Auch solche Sommerveranstaltungen sehen wir in den letzten Jahren häufiger“, sagte Coumou. Sperrereignisse wurden auch mit Sommerfluten in Großbritannien in Verbindung gebracht, die 2007 und 2012 zu katastrophalen Überschwemmungen führten, die Schäden in Milliardenhöhe verursachten.
Das Jahr 2012 war auch ein extremes Jahr für Grönland, mit einer Rekordschmelze auf der gesamten Oberfläche, die Wasser in den Ozean spülte und den Anstieg des Meeresspiegels beschleunigte. Die heiße Luftschleife, die sich in jenem Jahr auf Grönland befand, könnte auch mit einer der größten Wetterkatastrophen der letzten Jahre in Verbindung gebracht werden: Hurrikan Sandy, der 233 Menschen tötete und 75 Milliarden Dollar Schaden verursachte. Wissenschaftler vermuten, dass das Blockierungsereignis über Grönland, das möglicherweise mit dem Rekordtief des arktischen Eises in diesem Sommer zusammenhängt, verhinderte, dass der Hurrikan wie die meisten Stürme nach Nordosten in den Atlantik abbog. Stattdessen bog Sandy, blockiert durch den Hochdruck, nach links über das am dichtesten besiedelte Gebiet der Ostküste der USA. Schäden durch Hurrikan Sandy in Rodanthe, North Carolina, Oktober 2012
Eine weitere Folge der schnell schmelzenden Arktis lässt laut einigen Wissenschaftlern die Möglichkeit aufkommen, dass noch schlimmere Wetterextreme kommen werden: gigantische atlantische Superstürme und Hurrikane, die über Europa hinwegfegen.
Durch das Schmelzen des grönländischen Eises werden jährlich etwa 250 Milliarden Tonnen Süßwasser in den Ozean gespült, das eine geringere Dichte als salziges Meerwasser hat. Dadurch sinkt die Wassermasse weniger und die Strömung, die warmes Wasser den Atlantik hinaufzieht, wird geschwächt – Wissenschaftler haben bereits festgestellt, dass die Strömung seit einem Jahrtausend am schwächsten ist. Dies bedeutet, dass eine Region des Nordatlantiks relativ kühl wird, was den Kontrast zu den tropischen Gewässern im Süden, die der Motor für Stürme sind, übertreibt. Im schlimmsten Fall, sagte der renommierte Klimawissenschaftler Prof. James Hansen, „wird dies Superstürme antreiben, stärker als alle in der heutigen Zeit – im Nordatlantik und den Nachbarländern wird die Hölle losgehen“.
Hansen – der 1988 als einer der ersten Wissenschaftler die Welt vor den Gefahren des Klimawandels warnte und mehr als einmal vor dem Weißen Haus festgenommen wurde, als er gegen die Entwicklung fossiler Brennstoffe protestierte – wies auf die historische Aufzeichnung als Präzedenzfall hin: 118.000 Jahre Vor einem Supersturm wurden 1.000 Tonnen schwere Felsbrocken an die Küste der Bahamas geschleudert.
„Ich würde solche [Supersturm]-Szenarien sicherlich nicht als lächerlich bezeichnen“, sagte Coumou. „Aber es ist spekulativ – wir haben keine harten Beweise.“
Aber selbst mit dem, was bisher bekannt ist, gibt es Anlass zur Sorge, dass die komplexen Wechselwirkungen das langsame Brennen des globalen Temperaturanstiegs in plötzliche Wetterkatastrophen verwandeln.
„Der besorgniserregende Aspekt ist, dass solche dynamischen Veränderungen abrupter auftreten können als eine einfache Hintergrunderwärmung des Klimas“, sagte Coumou. „Dynamische Änderungen können sich schneller ändern und daher zu Überraschungen führen, und ich denke, dass es im System viele solcher Möglichkeiten gibt.“ Auf Spitzbergen schwimmt ein Eisbär. Die Fjorde dort waren normalerweise teilweise mit Meereis bedeckt, aber im letzten Winter war der größte Teil des Archipels von offenem Wasser umgeben.
Angesichts der düsteren Aussichten gibt es jedoch Anlass zur Hoffnung. „Ein großer Teil der US-Öffentlichkeit glaubt immer noch nicht, dass es der Mensch ist, der das Klimasystem beeinflusst“, sagte Francis. „Aber einer der Silberstreifen dieser ziemlich dunklen Wolke ist, dass die Arktis eine so offensichtliche und auffällige Veränderung ist, dass jeder sie sehen kann. Es gibt keinerlei Zweideutigkeit.“
Aber dieses Umdenken muss schnell gehen, sagte Hansen: „Wenn wir warten, bis sich die Natur klar offenbart, kann es zu spät sein.“"	Die Eisschmelze in der Arktis „beeinflusst bereits das Wetter dort, wo Sie gerade leben“	other
2d038c58	"Der Wissenschaftler Peter Wadhams glaubt, dass die sommerliche Eisdecke am Nordpol bald verschwinden wird, was zu einer noch schnelleren globalen Erwärmung führen wird. Der Wissenschaftler Peter Wadhams glaubt, dass die sommerliche Eisdecke am Nordpol bald verschwinden wird, was zu einer noch schnelleren globalen Erwärmung führen wird. Peter Wadhams hat seine Karriere in der Arktis verbracht und mehr als 50 Reisen dorthin unternommen, einige davon in U-Booten unter dem Polareis. Ihm wird zugeschrieben, einer der ersten Wissenschaftler zu sein, der zeigte, dass die dicke Eiskappe, die einst den Arktischen Ozean bedeckte, allmählich dünner und schrumpfender wurde. Er war von 1987 bis 1992 Direktor des Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge und seit 2001 Professor für Ozeanphysik in Cambridge. Sein Buch A Farewell to Ice erzählt die Geschichte seiner Enträtselung dieses alarmierenden Trends und beschreibt die Folgen für unseren Planeten wird, wenn das arktische Eis weiterhin so schnell verschwindet. Sie haben mehrfach gesagt, dass das sommerliche arktische Meereis Mitte dieses Jahrzehnts verschwinden würde. Es hat nicht. Sind Sie alarmistisch?
Nein. Bei der Sommerabdeckung gibt es einen klaren Trend nach unten gegen Null. Allerdings können jedes Jahr zufällige Ereignisse die Eisdecke ankurbeln oder etwas davon wegnehmen. Der Gesamttrend ist jedoch sehr stark rückläufig. Die meisten Menschen erwarten, dass dieses Jahr ein Rekordtief in der sommerlichen Meereisbedeckung der Arktis zu sehen sein wird. Nächstes oder übernächstes Jahr, denke ich, wird es im Sommer eisfrei sein, und damit meine ich, dass die zentrale Arktis eisfrei sein wird. Sie können den Nordpol mit dem Schiff überqueren. Im Sommer wird es in der Arktis immer noch etwa eine Million Quadratkilometer Eis geben, aber es wird in verschiedene Ecken und Winkel entlang der Nordwestpassage und entlang von Teilen der kanadischen Küste gepackt. Eisfrei bedeutet, dass das zentrale Becken der Arktis eisfrei sein wird, und ich denke, dass dies im Sommer 2017 oder 2018 der Fall sein wird. Warum sollten wir uns Sorgen um eine eisfreie Arktis im Sommer machen? Eine eisfreie Arktis im Sommer hält man eher für ein Symbol des globalen Wandels. Dinge passieren, heißt es. Tatsächlich werden die Auswirkungen tiefgreifend sein und den gesamten Planeten und seine Bevölkerung betreffen. Ein Schlüsseleffekt wird das Albedo-Feedback sein. Meereis reflektiert etwa 50 % der einfallenden Sonnenstrahlung zurück ins All. Im Gegensatz dazu reflektiert Wasser weniger als 10 %. Wenn Sie also Eis durch Wasser ersetzen, das dunkler ist, wird viel mehr Sonnenwärme vom Ozean absorbiert und der Planet wird sich noch schneller erwärmen als derzeit. Meereis fungiert auch als Klimaanlage. Winde, die über das Meer auf Landmassen wie Sibirien und Grönland treffen, werden nicht mehr gekühlt, wenn sie über Eis ziehen, und diese Orte werden noch weiter aufgeheizt. Diese Effekte könnten die Auswirkungen der globalen Erwärmung, die durch steigende Kohlenstoffemissionen verursacht wird, um 50 % erhöhen. Letztendlich besteht unsere einzige Hoffnung darin, einen Weg zu finden, Kohlendioxid aus der Atmosphäre zu entfernen, sobald es dort angekommen ist. Welche Auswirkungen wird dieser beschleunigte Temperaturanstieg haben? Die Luft über Grönland wird wärmer und immer mehr Eis schmilzt. Schon jetzt verliert er pro Jahr etwa 300 Kubikkilometer Eis. Auch die Antarktis trägt zur Schmelze bei. Der Anstieg des Meeresspiegels wird sich dadurch beschleunigen. Die jüngste Prognose des Zwischenstaatlichen Ausschusses für Klimaänderungen (IPCC) lautet, dass die Meere in diesem Jahrhundert um 60 bis 90 Zentimeter ansteigen werden. Ich halte einen Anstieg von ein bis zwei Metern für weitaus wahrscheinlicher. In der Tat ist es wahrscheinlich das Beste, worauf wir hoffen können. Das klingt vielleicht nicht viel, ist aber wirklich sehr ernst. Es wird die Häufigkeit von Sturmfluten auf der ganzen Welt enorm erhöhen. Vielleicht können wir in Großbritannien die Themsebarriere erhöhen, aber in Bangladesch bedeutet das nur, dass immer mehr Menschen ertrinken werden. Die globale Erwärmung ist im Allgemeinen mit einer erhöhten Verbrennung fossiler Brennstoffe und einem daraus resultierenden Anstieg des atmosphärischen Kohlendioxidgehalts verbunden. Aber ist das das einzige Klimaproblem, dem wir gegenüberstehen?
Nein ist es nicht. Wir haben auch das Thema Methan. Russische Wissenschaftler, die Gewässer vor ihrer Küste untersucht haben, haben immer mehr Methanfahnen entdeckt, die vom Meeresboden aufsteigen. Der Grund dafür ist eng mit der Erwärmung des Planeten und dem Schrumpfen der arktischen Eiskappen verbunden. Bis etwa 2005 gab es sogar im Sommer noch Meereis in Küstennähe. Dann begann es zu verschwinden, so dass für drei bis vier Monate im Jahr warmes Wasser in die seichten Gewässer rund um die Küsten gelangte, wo seit der letzten Eiszeit Dauerfrostboden bestand. Es hat zu schmelzen begonnen, mit gefährlichen Folgen. Unter dem Permafrost befinden sich Sedimente voller Methanhydrate. Wenn der Permafrost verschwindet, entlastet man diese Hydrate und das Methan kommt aus der Lösung. Können wir dieses Methan genau so überwachen, wie wir Kohlendioxid überwachen können? Ja, wir können Methan großflächig mit Satelliten messen. Diese haben gezeigt, dass Methanwerte, die den größten Teil des letzten Jahrhunderts ziemlich flach waren, zu steigen begonnen haben und sich beschleunigen, oft mit kleinen Ausreißern in der Grafik. Es gibt einen Wissenschaftler namens Jason Box, der in Dänemark für die Greenland Survey arbeitet, und er nennt diese Ausreißer Drachenatem. Sie sind keine Art von Messung, die von zwielichtigen Instrumenten verursacht wird. Sie sind echte Methanpulse, die aus Offshore-Rinnen kommen. Ein am 30.

Die durchschnittliche Ausdehnung des arktischen Meereises für Mai 2016 stellte ein neues Rekordtief seit Beginn der Satellitenbeobachtungen ein. Foto: Suomi NPP/NASA/NOAA Wie stark ist Methan als Erhitzer der Atmosphäre im Vergleich zu Kohlendioxid? Es ist 23-mal stärker. Allerdings verflüchtigt sich Methan viel schneller als Kohlendioxid. Es wird oxidiert, so dass es nur etwa sieben oder acht Jahre in der Atmosphäre verweilt. Im Gegensatz dazu verbleibt Kohlendioxid etwa 100 Jahre im Klimasystem, bevor es ins Meer gelangt und von Lebewesen aufgenommen wird, die sterben und den Meeresboden verunreinigen. Das dachten zumindest Wissenschaftler. Heute gibt es eine ganze Reihe von Forschern, die glauben, dass Kohlendioxid 1.000 Jahre in der Atmosphäre überdauern könnte. Auf lange Sicht wird Kohlendioxid also immer noch schlechter sein als Methan, wenn es darum geht, den Planeten zu erwärmen, weil ein einzelner Methanimpuls eine katastrophale Wirkung haben wird, aber wenn nichts folgt, wird er verschwinden. Aber bei Kohlendioxid gibt es einen Ratscheneffekt. Das gesamte Kohlendioxid, das wir durch die Verbrennung fossiler Brennstoffe freisetzen, reichert sich einfach in der Atmosphäre an. Wir müssen mit dem Kohlendioxid des letzten Jahrhunderts leben. Was das aussagt, ist einfach: Es gibt keine sichere Emissionsrate von Kohlendioxid. Deshalb bin ich verzweifelt, dass wir jemals in der Lage sein werden, die CO2-Emissionen zu senken. Wenn wir den Ausstoß von Kohlendioxid nicht stoppen können, was können wir dann tun? Letztendlich besteht unsere einzige Hoffnung darin, einen Weg zu finden, Kohlendioxid aus der Atmosphäre zu entfernen, sobald es dort angekommen ist. Sogar das IPCC hat zugegeben, dass wir einen Weg finden müssen, Kohlendioxid aus der Luft zu extrahieren. Das Problem ist, dass sie nicht wissen, wie wir das tun können. Das beliebteste System ist als BECCS bekannt: Bioenergie mit Kohlenstoffabscheidung und -speicherung. Im Wesentlichen pflanzt man Bäume und Sträucher auf weiten Landstrichen. Diese wachsen und nehmen dabei Kohlendioxid auf. Dann verbrennen Sie das Holz, um Kraftwerke zu betreiben, während Sie das freigesetzte Kohlendioxid einfangen, verflüssigen und speichern. Es klingt einfach. Wird es funktionieren? Ich bin etwas misstrauisch gegenüber dieser Technologie. BECCS wird so viel Land brauchen, um effektiv zu sein. Berechnungen deuten darauf hin, dass 40 % bis 50 % des Ackerlandes des Planeten benötigt würden, um es in dem von uns benötigten Umfang zu betreiben, und das würde nicht genügend Land für den Anbau von Pflanzen zur Ernährung der Welt oder als Wohnraum für eine lebensfähige Bevölkerung übrig lassen wilde Tiere und Pflanzen. Andere Techniken, wie das Zerkleinern und Verteilen von Olivingestein, das Kohlendioxid absorbiert, an Stränden, lassen sich einfach nicht skalieren. Sie werden nicht funktionieren, also müssen wir einen anderen Weg finden, Kohlendioxid direkt aus der Atmosphäre zu entfernen. Soweit ich sehen kann, muss es die Form einer Art Gerät haben, in das man an einem Ende Luft hineinpumpt und am anderen Ende Luft bekommt, ohne dass Kohlendioxid austritt. Ich bin mir sicher, dass es möglich ist, aber im Moment haben wir kein solches Gerät. Aber ohne so etwas kann ich mir nicht vorstellen, wie wir mit dem Kohlendioxid umgehen werden, das in die Atmosphäre gelangt. Wir werden uns auf eine Technologie verlassen müssen, die noch nicht entwickelt ist. Das ist ein Maß für die Probleme, die vor uns liegen. Ich denke, die Menschheit kann es schaffen, aber ich würde mich viel besser fühlen, wenn ich sehen würde, wie Regierungen in solche Technologien investieren."	„Nächstes oder übernächstes Jahr wird die Arktis eisfrei sein“	partially false
abc078e6	"Acht Länder kontrollieren das Land am Polarkreis. Fünf haben Küsten zu verteidigen. Die Temperatur steigt. Das Eis schmilzt. Der Wettlauf um neu zugängliche Ressourcen beginnt. Und Russland gewinnt an Boden. Die Geschichte der Arktis beginnt mit der Temperatur, aber es geht um so viel mehr – dies ist eine Geschichte über Öl und Wirtschaft, über Menschlichkeit und Wissenschaft, über Politik und Grenzen und das aufkommende Risiko eines ermutigten und wachsenden russischen Imperiums. Arktische Gletscher wie dieser im russischen Archipel Novaya Zemlya haben die Aufmerksamkeit von Wissenschaftlern auf sich gezogen, die versuchen zu verstehen, wie sie schmelzen und fließen. Foto: DigitalGlobe via Getty Images Die Welt als Ganzes hat sich seit 1880 um etwa 0,9 Grad Celsius (1,7 Grad Fahrenheit) erwärmt. Die arktischen Temperaturen sind im gleichen Zeitraum doppelt so stark gestiegen. Das letzte analysierte Jahr, Oktober 2015 bis September 2016, war laut Arctic Report Card 2016 3,5 °C wärmer als Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts. Nordkanada, Svalbard, Norwegen und die russische Karasee erreichten im vergangenen Herbst erstaunliche 14 ° C (25 ° F) über dem Normalwert. Wissenschaftler bezeichnen diese dramatischen physikalischen Veränderungen als „arktische Verstärkung“ oder positive Rückkopplungsschleifen. Es ist ein bisschen wie Zinseszins. Eine kleine Änderung Schneebälle, und die arktischen Bedingungen werden viel weniger arktisch, viel schneller. „Nach dreieinhalb Jahrzehnten Studium der Arktis und ihres Klimas“, schrieb Mark Serreze, Direktor des National Snow and Ice Data Center, kürzlich. „Ich bin zu dem Schluss gekommen, dass das, was im letzten Jahr passiert ist, sogar über das Äußerste hinausgeht.“ Veränderung der durchschnittlichen Jahrestemperaturen Quelle: Klimaforschungseinheit, University of East Anglia Die Hitze macht mit ihrer natürlichen Beute, dem Eis, schnellen Prozess.

Im vergangenen Monat wurde für März ein neues Tief erreicht, das 2015 um 23.000 Quadratmeilen übertraf. Verglichen mit der Basislinie von 1981 bis 2010 ist das durchschnittliche Meereisminimum im September um mehr als 13 Prozent pro Jahrzehnt gesunken. Eine aktuelle Studie in Nature Climate Change schätzt, dass 30 bis 50 Prozent des Meereisverlusts auf Klimaschwankungen zurückzuführen sind, während der Rest auf menschliche Aktivitäten zurückzuführen ist. Zurückweichendes Eis verringert das Gesamtreflexionsvermögen der Erde, wodurch die Arktis dunkler wird und daher noch mehr Wärme absorbiert wird.

Bis 2016 schrumpfte diese Zahl auf 22 Prozent. Mit einem größeren Anteil an saisonalem Eis, das jeden arktischen Sommer verschwindet, haben die Nationen des Nordens mehr Zeit und Gelegenheit, die Ressourcen unter und in ihren Hoheitsgewässern zu erkunden. Der Meereisverlust ist der Gewinn von Präsident Wladimir Putin. Russland ist bereits das größte Land der Erde und wird durch die Öffnung der Arktis Zugang zu Schifffahrtsrouten und Energiereserven sowie einen strategischen militärischen Vorteil erhalten. Entlang der russischen Küste, die mehr als die Hälfte der gesamten Arktis ausmacht, drängen Winde und Strömungen altes Eis von potenziellen Schifffahrtswegen weg und verhindern die Ansammlung von dickerem, mehrjährigem Eis, das andere Teile der Arktis länger unpassierbar machen würde Perioden. Diese Dynamik trägt dazu bei, die Northern Sea Route – den von Verladern erhofften Russian Express zwischen Westeuropa und Ostasien – näher an die Verwirklichung zu bringen.

Fotograf: Paulo Costa/Getty Images Meereis befindet sich per Definition bereits im Wasser und trägt daher nicht zum Anstieg des Meeresspiegels bei, wenn es sich auflöst. Die gleiche Logik gilt nicht für Grönlands schmelzende Gletscher und Eisschilde. Im vergangenen Jahr erlebte Grönland die zweitgrößte Schmelze seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen. Die heiße Jahreszeit dauerte im nordöstlichen Teil der Region beunruhigende 30 bis 40 Tage länger als gewöhnlich. In Grönlands Eisdecke ist genug Wasser eingeschlossen, um die Meere weltweit um 20 Fuß anzuheben. Obwohl es Jahrhunderte dauern kann, bis es vollständig schmilzt, sind Wissenschaftler besorgt, dass wir nur eine begrenzte Zeit haben, um zu handeln, um zu verhindern, dass das Klima den Untergang des Eisschilds blockiert.

Dieses Eis, das nach seinem charakteristischen Farbton benannt ist, ist so dünn, dass Sonnenlicht durchscheint und Phytoplankton gedeihen kann. Laut NOAA ist das Vegetationswachstum in Teilen der kanadischen und russischen arktischen Gewässer auf 5 bis 19 Prozent über dem Durchschnitt von 2003-2015 gestiegen. Was der Wandel für empfindliche Ökosysteme und Fischbestände bedeutet, ist Gegenstand einer zunehmenden Forschungsaufmerksamkeit. In einer Präsentation im November griff Johan Rockström, Umweltwissenschaftler und Direktor des Stockholm Resilience Center, zu wissenschaftlichen Euphemismen, um das enorme Ausmaß dieser ineinandergreifenden Veränderungen handhabbar zu machen – und wer darüber nachdenken muss: „Kanada, Russland und Teile von die USA scheinen die arktischen Nationen zu sein, die den größten, sagen wir, verschiedenen Risiken eines Regimewechsels ausgesetzt sind.“ Auf lange Sicht muss sich möglicherweise jeder Teil des arktischen Nahrungsnetzes an das Nebenprodukt der Erwärmung der Atmosphäre anpassen: veränderte Ozeanchemie Die Ozeane tun der Menschheit einen großen Gefallen, indem sie atmosphärisches Kohlendioxid absorbieren. Wenn sich CO2 jedoch in Wasser auflöst, wird es zu einer schwachen Säure, die bei ihrer Ansammlung Ökosysteme belasten kann, die sich für die heutigen leicht alkalischen Gewässer entwickelt haben. Die Veränderung findet weltweit statt , aber kaltes Wasser „versäuert"" schneller als wärmere Meere. Das arktische Land speichert etwa doppelt so viel Kohlenstoff wie die Atmosphäre. Während der Wachstumsperioden – die jetzt entweder länger oder neuerdings möglich sind Wissenschaftler glauben, dass die auftauenden Böden je nach genauem Standort – im Frühling und Sommer Kohlendioxid einsaugen – nun mehr Kohlenstoff emittieren, als sie aufnehmen. MAßNAHMEN Globale Aufzeichnung des täglichen Frost-/Tauwetterzustands der Landschaft Die vielleicht visuell dramatischste Veränderung der Landschaft hat sich in Russland ereignet. Erwärmungstemperaturen haben die Rate natürlicher unterirdischer Methanlecks beschleunigt. Das Gas sammelt sich im Boden und bildet Hügel, die „Pingos“ genannt werden. Wenn der Druck zu groß wird, explodiert der Boden und hinterlässt 30 bis 40 Meter breite Krater. Seismologen haben damit begonnen, Sensoren in der russischen Arktis zu installieren, um im Voraus über Felder zu informieren, die bereit sind, ihre Spitze zu sprengen. Diese lokalen Ereignisse sind ein eindrucksvolles visuelles Beispiel dafür, wie sich die Welt auf dramatische und überraschende Weise verändert. Dieser Krater entstand durch die Explosion eines „Pingo“, einer Methangastasche auf der russischen Jamal-Halbinsel in Nordsibirien. Erwärmende Bodentemperaturen lassen Pingos häufiger platzen. Fotograf: Vasily Bogoyavlensky/AFP via Getty Images Viele Wissenschaftler, die die Arktis untersuchen, sagen, dass solch dramatische Veränderungen an der Spitze der Welt einfach nicht vermeiden können, das Leben darunter zu beeinflussen.

03ed5214	Sie haben wahrscheinlich schon von einigen der Auswirkungen des Meeresspiegelanstiegs gehört: Fast ein Fünftel von Bangladesch in Südasien könnte überflutet werden; einige tief liegende Inseln im Pazifik könnten verschwinden; In Küstenstädten wie Miami und New York wird mit weiteren Überschwemmungen gerechnet. Aber wie genau und warum steigen die Meere? Die zugrunde liegende Antwort ist natürlich, dass Menschen den Planeten erwärmen, indem sie fossile Brennstoffe verbrennen, Wälder abholzen und sich an anderen Aktivitäten beteiligen, die wärmespeichernde Gase in die Atmosphäre freisetzen. Die politischen Entscheidungsträger sind zu dem Schluss gekommen, dass die Erwärmung besonders gefährlich wäre, wenn sie zu Beginn der industriellen Revolution eine Schwelle von 2 Grad Celsius über der Erdtemperatur überschreitet. Aber für Details darüber, wie der Klimawandel die Höhe des Ozeans erhöht, wandte ich mich an den Meteorologen und leitenden Wetterproduzenten Brandon Miller von CNN International. Ich werde den Anstieg des Meeresspiegels untersuchen und was mit Menschen passiert, deren Häuser diesen Monat im Rahmen der CNN-Serie „2 Grad“ über den Klimawandel überschwemmt werden. Lassen Sie mich in den Kommentaren am Ende dieses Beitrags wissen, ob es weitere Fragen zum Meeresspiegel gibt, die Sie gerne beantwortet sehen möchten. Und erwägen Sie, sich für den „2 Degrees“-Newsletter anzumelden, wenn Sie mitmachen möchten. 1. Warum steigen die Meeresspiegel? Der globale Anstieg des Meeresspiegels erfolgt aufgrund von zwei Faktoren. Der Hauptgrund liegt in der sogenannten „Wärmeausdehnung“, die einfach darin besteht, dass sich Wasser bei Erwärmung ausdehnt, genau wie sich die Flüssigkeit in einem Thermometer bei steigender Temperatur ausdehnt. Wenn die globalen Temperaturen weiter steigen, werden die Ozeane daher wärmer und dehnen sich buchstäblich aus, wodurch der Meeresspiegel steigt. Der andere Hauptfaktor für den Anstieg des Meeresspiegels ist der Verlust von Gletschern und der Polkappen. Wenn die Gletscher und Eiskappen schmelzen, fließt dieses Wasser in den Ozean und vergrößert sein Volumen. 2. Geschieht dies bereits – oder ist es eine Zukunftssache? Ja, es passiert bereits, und ja, es wird auch in Zukunft passieren, wobei die Geschwindigkeit des Meeresspiegelanstiegs wahrscheinlich ebenfalls zunehmen wird. Seit 1900 haben wir Meeresspiegel im Durchschnitt um etwa 20 cm (8 Zoll) ansteigen sehen. Während sich die Meeresspiegel in den letzten 2.000 Jahren veränderten, taten sie das viel langsamer. Es hätte mehrere hundert Jahre gedauert, um den Meeresspiegel um den Betrag zu ändern, den wir im letzten Jahrhundert erlebt haben, wobei ein Großteil dieses Anstiegs in den letzten 25 Jahren erfolgte. Die Änderungsrate in den letzten 20 Jahren ist etwa doppelt so hoch wie in den letzten 100 Jahren, was darauf hindeutet, dass der Anstieg des Meeresspiegels zunimmt. 3. Was passiert mit dem Meeresspiegel, wenn sich das Klima um 2 Grad erwärmt? Der Meeresspiegel wird sicherlich weiter steigen, wenn sich das Klima um 2 Grad Celsius (3,6 Fahrenheit) erwärmt. Der Anstieg des Meeresspiegels wird nicht aufhören, selbst wenn die Erwärmung bei 2 Grad endet. Stattdessen wird es aufgrund der verzögerten Reaktionszeiten der Weltmeere und der massiven Eisschilde viele Jahrhunderte andauern. Wenn wir uns die ferne Vergangenheit vor 120.000 Jahren ansehen, als es nur sehr frühe Menschen gab, war die Temperatur 2 Grad wärmer als heute. Der Meeresspiegel war etwa 5 Meter (16 Fuß) höher als heute. Fast 500 Millionen Menschen weltweit leben derzeit unter 5 Metern Höhe. 4. Wie stark wird der Meeresspiegel voraussichtlich bis zum Jahr 2100 ansteigen? Nach den neuesten Prognosen des Zwischenstaatlichen Ausschusses für Klimaänderungen (IPCC) würde ein Temperaturanstieg um 2 Grad bis zum Ende dieses Jahrhunderts zu einem Anstieg des Meeresspiegels um etwa einen halben Meter führen. Wenn wir die Menge an Treibhausgasen, die wir derzeit ausstoßen, drastisch und sofort reduzieren, wird der Meeresspiegel als Folge der bereits beobachteten Erwärmung immer noch weiter steigen, aber er sollte weniger sein, wahrscheinlich um 40 cm (15 Zoll). Wenn wir die Treibhausgasemissionen mit der derzeitigen Geschwindigkeit weiter erhöhen, könnte der Anstieg des Meeresspiegels bis zum Jahr 2100 bis zu doppelt so hoch sein, oder 80 cm (31 Zoll). 5. Was ist wirklich, wirklich langfristig? Eine der großen Fragen ist, wie viel Erwärmung nötig ist, um das grönländische Eisschild zu schmelzen, das genug Wasser enthält, um den Meeresspiegel um 7 Meter (23 Fuß) anzuheben. Diese Frage ist unglaublich schwer zu beantworten, aber aktuelle Forschungsergebnisse zeigen, dass die Erwärmung im Vergleich zum vorindustriellen Durchschnitt wahrscheinlich zwischen 1 und 4 Grad liegt. Wenn zum Beispiel 2 Grad ausreichen, um den grönländischen Eisschild zu schmelzen, könnte dies bedeuten, dass der Meeresspiegel viel höher und schneller ansteigen würde, als aktuelle Projektionen zeigen. Ein vollständiges Schmelzen des grönländischen Eises würde jedoch wahrscheinlich Tausende von Jahren dauern. 6. Werden viele der pazifischen Inseln tatsächlich verschwinden? Sie werden wahrscheinlich nicht verschwinden, zumindest nicht kurzfristig (bis zum Ende dieses Jahrhunderts), aber sie werden dramatisch betroffen sein. Viele niedrig gelegene Regionen werden drastische Veränderungen ihrer Küstengeographie durch Stranderosion, erhebliche Herausforderungen für die Infrastruktur durch Dinge wie das Eindringen von Salzwasser in das Wassersystem und die Vertreibung der Bevölkerung durch Überschwemmungen erleben. Es gibt einige extreme Beispiele, wie die Marshallinseln, wo 99 % des Landes unter 5 Metern Höhe liegen, die buchstäblich „von der Landkarte getilgt“ werden könnten, aber das Problem ist weitaus umfassender als ein paar winzige Pazifikinseln Inseln. Küstengemeinden auf der ganzen Welt werden einem höheren Risiko durch sturmbedingte Flutwellen, häufige Überschwemmungen durch Hochwasser usw. ausgesetzt sein. Viele der größten und einflussreichsten Städte der Welt liegen an der Küste und müssen erhebliche Vorbereitungen treffen, um den steigenden Meeresspiegel zu bekämpfen. 7. Was ist mit Bangladesch? Ist das Risiko nicht sehr hoch? Ja absolut. Bangladesch befindet sich in einer sehr prekären Situation, da es infolge des Klimawandels von allen Seiten Überschwemmungen ausgesetzt ist. Der Anstieg des Meeresspiegels wird die Küstengemeinden auf niedriger Ebene kontinuierlich schrumpfen lassen, während die großen Flüsse, die durch Bangladesch fließen (Ganges und Brahmaputra), mit steigenden Wasserständen von schmelzenden Gletschern im Himalaya konfrontiert sein werden. Bangladesch hat mit 158 ​​Millionen die achtgrößte Bevölkerung aller Länder, und die Mehrheit dieser Menschen lebt in den Gebieten, in denen diese ansteigenden Flüsse auf ein ansteigendes Meer treffen. 8. Was passiert mit US-Städten – wie New York, NOLA und Miami? Die Weltbank führte kürzlich eine Studie durch, in der Städte auf der ganzen Welt nach ihrem Risiko von Küstenüberschwemmungen infolge des Klimawandels eingestuft wurden. Bei Betrachtung der Gesamtschadenskosten lagen fünf der Top-10-Städte in den Vereinigten Staaten: Miami (2), New York (3), New Orleans (4), Tampa (7), Boston (8). Dies liegt vor allem an den enormen Mengen an Infrastruktur, Wirtschaftsgütern und Bevölkerung, die sich direkt an der Küste und in geringer Höhe befinden. Basierend auf der US National Climate Assessment von 2014 würde New York City bis 2100 einen lokalen Meeresspiegelanstieg von fast 4 Fuß erleben. Ein Anstieg des Meeresspiegels um 4 Fuß für New York würde dazu führen, dass fast 100.000 Menschen allein in New York City unter Wasser wären. mit einem Immobilienwert von 16,5 Milliarden US-Dollar. 9. Wie viele Menschen werden durch den Meeresanstieg vertrieben? In einer 2-Grad-Welt werden Hunderte Millionen Menschen von Küstenüberschwemmungen als Folge des Klimawandels betroffen sein. Asien, nämlich Ost-, Südost- und Südasien, wird besonders betroffen sein. Leider verfügen einige dieser Regionen, die den größten und unmittelbarsten Auswirkungen des Meeresanstiegs ausgesetzt sein werden, über die geringsten Ressourcen, um diesen zu bekämpfen. In vielen Fällen sind die Kosten für die Küstenanpassung möglicherweise zu hoch, Überschwemmungen durch Stürme, die höhere Wasserstände in die Häuser drücken, werden zu häufig, oder das Eindringen von Salzwasser in den lokalen Grundwasserspiegel macht den Anbau von Pflanzen unmöglich – und die Menschen in allen Regionen von die Welt wird gezwungen sein, ihre Häuser und Städte zu verlassen.

8695b2a9	„Der menschliche Beitrag kann bis zu 30 Prozent des gesamten Regens ausmachen, der aus dem Sturm kommt.“ Hurrikan Harvey zeichnet sich vor der Küste von Texas ab, von Bord der Internationalen Raumstation aus gesehen. Hin und wieder tritt das Worst-Case-Szenario ein. Ab Sonntagnachmittag scheinen die Überreste des Hurrikans Harvey wahrscheinlich die schlimmsten Vorhersagen zu übertreffen, die dem Sturm vorausgingen. Die gesamte Metropolregion Houston ist überschwemmt: Autobahnen stehen unter Wasser, lokale Behörden haben Bootsbesitzer gebeten, sich den Rettungsbemühungen anzuschließen, und die meisten Bäche und Flüsse in der Nähe der Stadt stehen unter Hochwasser. Einige Modelle deuten darauf hin, dass der Sturm bis Mittwochnacht über dem Gebiet verweilen und insgesamt 50 Zoll Wasser auf Houston und die Umgebung kippen wird. „Lokale Niederschlagsmengen von 50 Zoll würden alle bisherigen Niederschlagsrekorde in Texas übertreffen. Die Breite und Intensität dieser Regenfälle übersteigen alles, was bisher erlebt wurde“, heißt es in einer Erklärung des Nationalen Wetterdienstes. „Katastrophale Überschwemmungen sind jetzt im Gange und werden voraussichtlich mehrere Tage andauern.“ (In den Jahren der Wetterberichterstattung habe ich noch nie eine so unverblümte und ominöse Aussage gesehen.) Das bedeutet, dass Tausende von Menschen – und vielleicht Zehntausende von Menschen – gerade jetzt mit einem schrecklichen und allzu realen Kampf ums Überleben konfrontiert sind. In einer Zeit, in der sich das Klima schnell ändert, stellt sich natürlich die Frage: Welche Rolle spielte die vom Menschen verursachte globale Erwärmung bei der Verstärkung dieses Sturms? Klimawissenschaftler, die sich darauf spezialisiert haben, das Erdsystem als Ganzes zu betrachten, zögern oft, ein einzelnes Wetterereignis mit dem globalen Klimawandel in Verbindung zu bringen. Aber sie sagen, dass Aspekte des Falls von Hurrikan Harvey – und die jüngste Geschichte tropischer Wirbelstürme weltweit – darauf hindeuten, dass die globale Erwärmung eine schlechte Situation verschlimmert. Es mag nicht offensichtlich sein, warum die globale Erwärmung irgendetwas mit der Stärke von Hurrikanen zu tun hat. Der Klimawandel wird durch die Freisetzung von Treibhausgasen wie Kohlendioxid und Methan in die Atmosphäre verursacht. Diese Gase verhindern, dass ein Teil der Sonnenstrahlen in den Weltraum zurückprallt, Wärme im Planetensystem einschließt und die Lufttemperatur auf der ganzen Welt erhöht. Diese wärmere Luft bewirkt eine schnellere Verdunstung, was zu mehr Feuchtigkeit in der Atmosphäre führen kann. Aber dieses Phänomen allein erklärt nicht die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels auf Harvey. Stürme wie Harvey werden durch eine der Folgen des Klimawandels unterstützt: Wenn sich die Luft erwärmt, wird ein Teil dieser Wärme vom Ozean absorbiert, was wiederum die Temperatur der oberen Meeresschichten erhöht. Harvey profitierte von ungewöhnlich warmen Gewässern im Golf von Mexiko. Als der Sturm letzte Woche in Richtung Houston tobte, stieg das Wasser an der Meeresoberfläche in der Nähe von Texas auf 2,7 bis 7,2 Grad Fahrenheit über dem Durchschnitt. Diese Gewässer waren einige der heißesten Punkte der Meeresoberfläche in der Welt. Der tropische Sturm, der sich von dieser ungewöhnlichen Wärme ernährte, konnte sich in etwa 48 Stunden von einem tropischen Tiefdruckgebiet zu einem Hurrikan der Kategorie vier entwickeln. „Dies ist der Hauptbrennstoff für den Sturm“, sagt Kevin Trenberth, ein leitender Wissenschaftler am U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research. „Obwohl diese Stürme natürlich auftreten, ist der Sturm tendenziell intensiver, vielleicht etwas größer, länger anhaltend und mit viel stärkeren Regenfällen [wegen dieser Meereshitze].“ Dies deutet auch auf eine Erklärung für eines der seltsamsten und gruseligsten Verhaltensweisen von Harvey hin. Der Sturm verstärkte sich bis zum Moment der Landung und erreichte Stunden der Stärke der Kategorie vier, bevor er auf die texanische Küste traf. Das ist bei tropischen Wirbelstürmen im westlichen Golf von Mexiko nicht nur selten, sondern vielleicht einzigartig. In den letzten 30 Jahren der Aufzeichnungen hat sich in den letzten 12 Stunden vor der Landung kein Sturm westlich von Florida verstärkt. Warum werden Stürme normalerweise schwächer – und warum nicht Harvey? Wie oben erwähnt, ernähren und wachsen Hurrikane auf warmen Oberflächengewässern der Ozeane. Aber während sie wachsen, nehmen ihre starken Winde oft Meerwasser auf, wirbeln die Ozeane auf und bewegen das wärmste Wasser tief unter die Oberfläche. Dieselben Winde bringen auch neueres, kälteres Wasser näher an die Atmosphäre, was normalerweise dazu dient, Energie zu entziehen und den Sturm zu schwächen. Bei Harvey ist das nicht passiert. Der Hurrikan wirbelte Wasser 100 oder sogar 200 Meter unter der Oberfläche auf, sagte Trenberth, aber dieses Wasser war immer noch warm – was bedeutet, dass der Sturm weiter wachsen und stärker werden konnte. „Harvey war nicht in einer guten Position, um so intensiv zu werden, weil es so nah am Land war. Es ist erstaunlich, dass es dazu in der Lage war“, sagte er mir. All dies gesagt, hätte ein Sturm wie Harvey auch ohne Klimawandel passieren können. Planungsexperten haben lange über die Möglichkeit eines großen Hurrikans nachgedacht, der Houston treffen könnte. Harvey ist auch ein starker Hurrikan, der sich in einer der hurrikanfreundlichsten Regionen der Welt am Höhepunkt der Hurrikansaison bildet. Ähnliche Stürme würden sich in jedem Klima bilden. Aber Trenberth sagt, dass die zusätzliche Hitze den Sturm kostspieliger und mächtiger machen könnte, lokale Entwässerungssysteme überwältigen und schließlich zerstören könnte. „Der menschliche Beitrag kann bis zu 30 Prozent des gesamten Regens ausmachen, der aus dem Sturm kommt“, sagte er. „Es mag ein starker Sturm gewesen sein und trotzdem viele Probleme verursacht haben – aber [der vom Menschen verursachte Klimawandel] verstärkt den Schaden erheblich.“ Generell ist noch unklar, welche Auswirkungen der Klimawandel auf die Hurrikanbildung im Atlantik hat. Eine Entwurfsversion einer großen Überprüfung der US-Regierung der Klimawissenschaft, die später in diesem Jahr erscheinen soll, besagt, dass „mittleres Vertrauen“ besteht, dass menschliche Aktivitäten „zu dem beobachteten Aufwärtstrend der Hurrikanaktivität im Nordatlantik seit den 1970er Jahren beigetragen haben“. Houston war in letzter Zeit der Ground Zero für superzerstörerische Stürme. Laut dem Meteorologen Eric Holthaus hat es seit dem Frühjahr 2015 vier 100-jährliche Überschwemmungen gegeben. Die Stadt sieht auch 167 Prozent mehr schwere Regengüsse als in den 1950er Jahren. Inzwischen hat nur ein Sechstel seiner Einwohner eine staatliche Hochwasserversicherung, obwohl dieses Programm Schwierigkeiten hat, sich an das erhöhte Überschwemmungsrisiko im Zusammenhang mit dem Klimawandel anzupassen. Doch selbst im Vergleich zu den jüngsten Stürmen ist Harvey beispiellos – genau die Art von seltsamem Wetter, von dem Wissenschaftler mehr erwarten, wenn sich der Planet erwärmt. Harvey hat bereits mehr Wasser in Harris County abgelassen als Tropensturm Allison, die bisher schlimmste Überschwemmungskatastrophe in der Region im Jahr 2001, obwohl sie nur halb so lange gedauert hat wie dieser frühere Sturm. Und es wird weiter regnen. Am Sonntagnachmittag steht der Buffalo Bayou, ein großer Fluss in der Nähe der Innenstadt von Houston, einen Fuß über der Flutstufe. Es wird prognostiziert, dass er allein heute um weitere 12 Fuß steigen wird.	Hat der Klimawandel den Hurrikan Harvey verstärkt?	true
d4903310	"Ein Stück schwimmendes Eis, das mehr als eine Billion Tonnen wiegt, löste sich von der Antarktischen Halbinsel und erzeugte einen der größten Eisberge, die je aufgezeichnet wurden, und gab einen Einblick, wie die antarktische Eisdecke schließlich auseinanderfallen könnte.

Wie schnell das passieren könnte, ist unklar. Ende des 20. Jahrhunderts war die Antarktische Halbinsel, die aus dem Hauptteil der Antarktis herausragt und in Richtung Südamerika zeigt, einer der sich am schnellsten erwärmenden Orte der Welt. Diese Erwärmung hatte sich im 21. Jahrhundert verlangsamt oder vielleicht sogar leicht umgekehrt, aber Wissenschaftler glauben, dass das Eis die höheren Temperaturen immer noch einholt. Einige Klimawissenschaftler glauben, dass die Erwärmung in der Region zumindest teilweise eine Folge des vom Menschen verursachten Klimawandels war, während andere dies bestreiten, da sie eine große Rolle für die natürliche Variabilität sehen – und feststellen, dass sich Eisberge für viele von den Eisschelfs gelöst haben Millionen von Jahren. Aber die beiden Lager stimmen darin überein, dass das Aufbrechen der Schelfeise in der Region der Halbinsel eine Vorschau auf das sein könnte, was dem Hauptteil der Antarktis bevorsteht, während sich die Welt aufgrund menschlicher Aktivitäten weiter aufheizt. „Obwohl es nicht durch die globale Erwärmung verursacht werden muss, ist es zumindest ein natürliches Labor, um zu untersuchen, wie es bei anderen Eisschelfs zu Aufbrüchen kommen wird, um die theoretische Grundlage für unsere Projektionen des zukünftigen Meeresspiegelanstiegs zu verbessern“, sagte Thomas P. Wagner, der Leiter Die Bemühungen der NASA, die Polarregionen zu untersuchen. Das Zeitrafferbild unten zeigt, wie sich die Kluft von Ende 2014 bis Januar dieses Jahres allmählich erweitert. In kalten Regionen bilden sich Schelfeis, wenn die langen Eisflüsse, die Gletscher genannt werden, vom Land ins Meer fließen. Das Ergebnis ist ein bisschen wie eine Verstopfung in einem Abflussrohr, das den Fluss der Gletscher verlangsamt, die sie speisen. Wenn ein Schelfeis zusammenbricht, können die Gletscher dahinter beschleunigen, als ob das Abflussrohr plötzlich frei wäre. Am verbleibenden Teil von Larsen C liegt die Kante jetzt viel näher an einer Linie, die Wissenschaftler als Druckbogen bezeichnen, der für die strukturelle Unterstützung entscheidend ist. Wenn sich die Front über diese Linie hinaus zurückzieht, könnte der nördlichste Teil des Schelfs innerhalb von Monaten einstürzen. „Zu diesem Zeitpunkt werden die Gletscher reagieren“, sagte Eric Rignot, ein Klimawissenschaftler an der University of California, Irvine, der umfangreiche Forschungen zum Polareis durchgeführt hat. „Wenn das Schelfeis auseinanderbricht, wird es eine Stützkraft von den Gletschern nehmen, die hineinfließen. Die Gletscher spüren weniger Strömungswiderstand und entfernen effektiv einen Korken vor ihnen.“ Wissenschaftler befürchten zudem, dass zwei entscheidende Ankerpunkte verloren gehen. Laut Dr. Rignot ist die Stabilität des gesamten Schelfeises gefährdet, da die Schelffront dünner wird. „Sie haben diese beiden Anker an der Seite von Larsen C, die eine entscheidende Rolle dabei spielen, das Schelfeis dort zu halten, wo es ist“, sagte er. „Wenn das Regal dünner wird, wird es zerbrechlicher und es verliert den Kontakt mit den Eiserhöhungen.“ Low Shelf Support High Wenn sich die Shelf Front von den Eiserhöhungen löst, wird ein schneller Rückzug ausgelöst.

Wissenschaftler müssen noch das Ausmaß der Ausdünnung um die Eisberge Bawden und Gipps bestimmen, obwohl Dr. Rignot feststellte, dass der Eisberg Bawden anfälliger war. „Wir sind uns nicht einmal sicher, wie es dort hängt“, sagte er. „Aber wenn du Bawden wegnimmst, wird es das ganze Regal spüren.“
Die Antarktische Halbinsel könnte ein Kanarienvogel in einer Kohlemine sein. Der Zusammenbruch des Schelfeises der Halbinsel kann als Erfüllung einer Prophezeiung interpretiert werden, die 1978 von einem renommierten Geologen namens John H. Mercer von der Ohio State University gemacht wurde. In einem klassischen Artikel warnte Dr. Mercer davor, dass der westliche Teil der Antarktis so anfällig für die vom Menschen verursachte Klimaerwärmung sei, dass er eine „Drohung einer Katastrophe“ durch steigende Meere darstelle. Er sagte, dass die Menschheit wissen würde, dass die Katastrophe begonnen hatte, als Schelfeis entlang der Halbinsel aufzubrechen begann, wobei sich die Aufbrüche zunehmend nach Süden bewegten. Das Larsen-A-Schelfeis löste sich ab 1995 über mehrere Jahre hinweg auf; die Larsen B erlitt 2002 einen dramatischen Zusammenbruch; und jetzt, so befürchten Wissenschaftler, könnte das Kalben des riesigen Eisbergs die erste Phase des Auseinanderbrechens von Larsen C sein. „Wenn die Klimaerwärmung weiter nach Süden fortschreitet“, sagte Dr. Rignot, „wird sie immer größere Schelfeise betreffen und zurückhalten immer größere Gletscher, so dass ihr Zusammenbruch mehr zum Anstieg des Meeresspiegels beitragen wird.“ Wenn Sie mehr über die Antarktis berichten möchten, lesen Sie die Antarctic Dispatches oder sehen Sie sich vier Virtual-Reality-Filme in The Antarctica Series an."

dab821ac	Eine große Forschungszusammenfassung, die in einer der einflussreichsten wissenschaftlichen Zeitschriften der Welt veröffentlicht wurde, hat einen Rückgang der Menge an gelöstem Sauerstoff in Ozeanen auf der ganzen Welt festgestellt – eine seit langem vorhergesagte Folge des Klimawandels, der schwerwiegende Folgen für Meeresorganismen haben könnte, wenn dies der Fall ist geht weiter. Das Papier, das am Mittwoch in der Zeitschrift Nature von der Ozeanographin Sunke Schmidtko und zwei Kollegen vom GEOMAR Helmholtz-Zentrum für Ozeanforschung in Kiel, Deutschland, veröffentlicht wurde, stellte fest, dass der Sauerstoffgehalt der Ozeane zwischen 1960 und 2010 weltweit um mehr als 2 Prozent zurückgegangen ist. tauchten jedoch in einigen Ozeanbecken häufiger auf als in anderen. Das größte Gesamtvolumen an Sauerstoff ging im größten Ozean – dem Pazifik – verloren, aber prozentual war der Rückgang im Arktischen Ozean am stärksten, einer Region, die dem stärksten Klimawandel der Erde ausgesetzt ist. Der Verlust von Ozeansauerstoff „wurde von Modellen angenommen, und es gab viele regionale Analysen, die einen lokalen Rückgang gezeigt haben, aber er wurde nie auf globaler Ebene und niemals für die Tiefsee gezeigt“, sagte Schmidtko, der leitete die Forschung mit Lothar Stramma und Martin Visbeck, ebenfalls vom GEOMAR. Ozeansauerstoff ist für Meeresorganismen lebenswichtig, aber auch sehr empfindlich – anders als in der Atmosphäre, wo sich Gase gründlich miteinander vermischen, sei das im Ozean viel schwieriger zu bewerkstelligen, erklärte Schmidtko. Darüber hinaus, fügte er hinzu, vermischt sich nur 1 Prozent des gesamten verfügbaren Sauerstoffs der Erde mit dem Ozean; die überwiegende Mehrheit bleibt in der Luft. Klimawandelmodelle sagen voraus, dass die Ozeane aufgrund mehrerer Faktoren Sauerstoff verlieren werden. Am offensichtlichsten ist einfach, dass wärmeres Wasser weniger gelöste Gase enthält, einschließlich Sauerstoff. „Das ist der gleiche Grund, warum wir unsere prickelnden Getränke ziemlich kalt halten“, sagte Schmidtko. Aber ein weiterer Faktor ist die zunehmende Schichtung des Ozeanwassers. Sauerstoff gelangt an seiner Oberfläche, aus der Atmosphäre und durch die photosynthetische Aktivität mariner Mikroorganismen in den Ozean. Aber wenn sich diese obere Schicht erwärmt, ist es weniger wahrscheinlich, dass sich das sauerstoffreiche Wasser mit kühleren Schichten des Ozeans vermischt, da das warme Wasser weniger dicht ist und nicht so leicht absinkt. „Wenn sich der obere Ozean erwärmt, gelangt weniger Wasser in die Tiefe, und daher wird die Sauerstoffversorgung des tiefen Ozeans unterbrochen oder erheblich reduziert“, sagte Schmidtko. Die neue Studie stellt laut GEOMAR eine Synthese von buchstäblich „Millionen“ separater Ozeanmessungen im Laufe der Zeit dar. Die Autoren verwendeten dann Interpolationstechniken für Bereiche des Ozeans, in denen ihnen Messungen fehlten. Die resultierende Studie schreibt weniger als 15 Prozent des gesamten Sauerstoffverlusts rein wärmeren Temperaturen zu, die eine geringere Löslichkeit erzeugen. Der Rest wurde anderen Faktoren zugeschrieben, wie z. B. mangelnder Vermischung. Matthew Long, ein Ozeanograph vom National Center for Atmospheric Research, der über den Sauerstoffverlust im Ozean veröffentlicht hat, sagte, er betrachte die neuen Ergebnisse als „robust“ und als „großen Fortschritt bei der Synthese von Beobachtungen zur Untersuchung von Sauerstofftrends auf globaler Ebene“. Long war nicht an der aktuellen Arbeit beteiligt, aber seine Forschung hatte zuvor gezeigt, dass ein Sauerstoffverlust im Ozean zu erwarten war und dass es bald möglich sein sollte, dies in der realen Welt durch Messungen nachzuweisen, trotz der Komplexität, die mit der Untersuchung des globalen Ozeans verbunden ist daraus Trends abzuleiten. Genau das hat die neue Studie getan. „Natürliche Schwankungen haben unsere Fähigkeit beeinträchtigt, dieses Signal in Beobachtungen definitiv zu erkennen“, sagte Long in einer E-Mail. „In dieser Studie haben Schmidtko et al. alle verfügbaren Beobachtungen synthetisieren, um einen globalen Sauerstoffrückgang zu zeigen, der den Mustern entspricht, die wir von der vom Menschen verursachten Klimaerwärmung erwarten. Sie machen keine definitive Zuordnungserklärung, aber die Daten stimmen mit der vom Menschen verursachten Erwärmung als Grundursache für den Sauerstoffrückgang überein und deuten stark darauf hin. „Es ist alarmierend zu sehen, dass sich dieses Signal in den Beobachtungsdaten deutlich abzeichnet“, fügte er hinzu. „Die Ergebnisse von Schmidtko und Kollegen sollten noch mehr Alarmglocken über die Folgen der globalen Erwärmung läuten lassen“, fügte Denis Gilbert, Forscher am Maurice Lamontagne Institute at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in Quebec, in einem begleitenden Kommentar zu der Studie hinzu, der ebenfalls in Nature veröffentlicht wurde . Da der Sauerstoff im globalen Ozean nicht gleichmäßig verteilt ist, bedeutet der Gesamtrückgang von 2 Prozent, dass es in einigen Bereichen des Ozeans einen viel größeren Rückgang gibt als in anderen. Außerdem gibt es im Ozean bereits sogenannte Sauerstoffminimumzonen, die meist in mittleren Tiefen zu finden sind. Die große Befürchtung ist, dass ihre Ausbreitung nach oben in Lebensräume, in denen Fische und andere Organismen gedeihen, den verfügbaren Lebensraum für Meeresorganismen verringern wird. In flacheren Gewässern hingegen kann die Entwicklung von „hypoxischen“ Ozeangebieten oder sogenannten „toten Zonen“ teilweise auch durch den insgesamt abnehmenden Sauerstoffgehalt beeinflusst werden. Darüber hinaus kann der abnehmende Sauerstoffgehalt im Ozean in einer Rückkopplungsschleife auch die globale Erwärmung verschlimmern. In oder in der Nähe von sauerstoffarmen Gebieten der Ozeane neigen Mikroorganismen dazu, Lachgas zu produzieren, ein Treibhausgas, schreibt Gilbert. Daher „impliziert die neue Studie, dass die Produktionsraten und der Austritt von Lachgas in die Atmosphäre … wahrscheinlich gestiegen sein werden“. Die neue Studie unterstreicht einmal mehr, dass einige der tiefgreifendsten Folgen des Klimawandels in den Ozeanen und nicht an Land stattfinden. In den letzten Jahren hat das Eindringen von warmem Meerwasser zu einem großen Absterben von Korallenriffen und in einigen Fällen auch von Seetangwäldern geführt. Inzwischen haben wärmere Ozeane auch begonnen, Gletscher in Grönland und der Antarktis zu destabilisieren, und wenn sie schmelzen, erfrischen diese Gletscher das Ozeanwasser und verändern möglicherweise die Art ihrer Zirkulation. Wenn es um die Desoxidation der Ozeane geht, sollte sich dieser Trend mit fortschreitendem Klimawandel ebenfalls verstärken – Studien gehen von einem Verlust von bis zu 7 Prozent des Sauerstoffs der Ozeane bis 2100 aus. Am Ende des aktuellen Papiers sprechen die Forscher unverblümt über die Folgen ein anhaltender Verlust von ozeanischem Sauerstoff. „Es sind weitreichende Auswirkungen auf marine Ökosysteme und die Fischerei zu erwarten“, schreiben sie	Wissenschaftler haben gerade eine große Veränderung in den Ozeanen der Erde festgestellt, die mit einem sich erwärmenden Klima zusammenhängt	true
6c88493a	Die Vereinigten Staaten werden Zeuge einer massiven, gefährlichen Hitzewelle, da ein riesiges Hochdrucksystem den zentralen Teil des Landes bedeckt. Es ist eine so große Sache, dass Präsident Obama gestern sogar darüber getwittert hat, einschließlich einer Karte, die den maximalen Hitzeindex in einigen Teilen des Mittleren Westens und Südostens zeigt, der am Samstag 110 oder 115 Grad erreichte. Hier in Washington könnten die Temperaturen am Freitag oder am Wochenende 100 Grad erreichen. Dies wird unweigerlich dazu führen, dass in den kommenden Tagen viel über den Klimawandel gesprochen wird. Daher ist es wichtig, die Spreu vom Weizen zu trennen und herauszufinden, was die Wissenschaft zuverlässig über den Zusammenhang zwischen einem Ereignis wie diesem und einem sich erwärmenden Planeten sagen kann und was nicht – insbesondere in einem Jahr, das auf globaler Ebene so ist hat in sechs der letzten sechs Monate vergangene Temperaturrekorde gebrochen. Und das Wesentliche ist, dass, wenn es um extreme Hitzewellen im Allgemeinen geht – Hitzewellen, die in irgendeiner Weise außerhalb der Norm erscheinen, beispielsweise in ihrer Intensität, Häufigkeit oder Dauer –, während Wissenschaftler niemals sagen, dass einzelne Ereignisse durch das Klima „verursacht“ werden ändern, werden sie immer weniger umsichtig, wenn es darum geht, eine Verbindung herzustellen. „So vorhersehbar wie der Sonnenaufgang, einige werden sagen, dass Hitzewellen immer passiert sind“, sagte Marshall Shepherd, Direktor des Programms für Atmosphärenwissenschaften an der University of Georgia und ehemaliger Präsident der American Meteorological Society. „Ja, Homeruns im Baseball auch, aber die Steroid-Ära brachte immer längere Homeruns. Eine neue Studie der National Academies legt nahe, dass „Hitzewellen“ einer der Hauptindikatoren für den Klimawandel sein könnten, wie es Homeruns im Baseball waren.“ Mit anderen Worten, wenn sich ein Planet erwärmt, verschieben sich die Chancen zugunsten intensiverer oder länger anhaltender Hitzewellen. Das ist einfach nur Logik. Tatsächlich stellt der fragliche Bericht der National Academy of Sciences fest, dass „das Vertrauen in die Zuordnungsergebnisse des anthropogenen Einflusses bei jenen Extremereignissen am größten ist, die mit einem Temperaturaspekt zusammenhängen, wie z. B. der beobachteten langfristigen Erwärmung der Region oder des globalen Klimas , wo kaum Zweifel bestehen, dass menschliche Aktivitäten eine beobachtete Veränderung verursacht haben.“ „Insbesondere bei extremen Hitze- und Kälteereignissen bieten Änderungen der langfristigen mittleren Bedingungen eine Grundlage für die Erwartung, dass es auch Änderungen bei extremen Bedingungen geben sollte.“ Und wir hatten definitiv bereits Veränderungen, nicht nur bei den „langfristigen Durchschnittsbedingungen“, sondern auch bei den Hitzewellen selbst. Die US National Climate Assessment stellte fest, dass US-Hitzewellen bereits „häufiger und intensiver geworden sind“, dass die USA viel häufiger Hochtemperaturrekorde brechen als Tieftemperaturrekorde (genau wie Sie es erwarten würden), und dass es so ist sieht entsprechend weniger Kälteeinbrüche. In Bezug auf Zukunftsprognosen fügte die Bewertung hinzu, dass „Klimamodelle prognostizieren, dass die gleichen Sommertemperaturen, die zwischen 1950 und 1979 zu den heißesten 5 % gehörten, mindestens 70 % der Zeit von 2035 bis 2064 in den USA auftreten werden, wenn es um globale Emissionen geht der wärmespeichernden Gase nehmen weiter zu.“ Auf all dies hinzuweisen ist jedoch nicht dasselbe wie eine spezifische Zuordnung für dieses spezielle Hitzeereignis vorzunehmen – es bedeutet vielmehr, dass eine Zuordnung für diese Kategorie oder Art von Ereignis vorgenommen werden kann. Darüber hinaus erfordert eine spezifische Zuordnung aktive Forschung und Aufmerksamkeit für die tatsächlichen Temperaturen, die Dauer und andere Aspekte des Wetterphänomens. Das liegt daran, dass es, wie Shepherd anmerkt, selbst in einem stabilen Klima immer Hitzewellen gibt. Typischerweise verwenden Wissenschaftler in einer solchen Zuordnungsstudie Sätze von Klimamodellen – ein Satz enthält die Faktoren, die die menschliche globale Erwärmung antreiben, und der andere enthält rein „natürliche“ Faktoren – und prüfen, ob ein Ereignis wie das fragliche wahrscheinlicher ist treten in der ersten Reihe von Modellen auf. Forscher werden immer besser darin, diese Art von Studien schnell und nahezu in Echtzeit durchzuführen. Seien Sie also überhaupt nicht überrascht, wenn wir eine solche Studie für das aktuelle Hitzewellenereignis sehen – so wie wir es kürzlich für die verheerende Ausbleiche des Great Barrier Reef gesehen haben, die mit einer extremen marinen Hitzewelle vor dem Nordosten Australiens verbunden war Küste. Aber in der Zwischenzeit halten sich einige Wissenschaftler und Experten nicht zurück. Bei jeder Hitzewelle ist wahrscheinlich die Frage Nummer eins: Ist es der Klimawandel oder nicht? Nun, die Antwort ist, es ist beides“, sagte die Klimawissenschaftlerin Katharine Hayhoe von der Texas Tech University bei einem Pressegespräch am Donnerstag. „Wir bekommen natürlich Hitzewellen, aber der Klimawandel verstärkt sie, er gibt ihnen diese zusätzliche Energie, um sie noch ernster zu machen und noch größere Auswirkungen zu haben.“ Hayhoe hat nicht versucht, der aktuellen Hitzewelle eine spezifische Zuordnung zu geben, ebensowenig wie Shepherd es tat. Vielmehr artikuliert sie noch einmal die allgemeine Verbindung. „Wir sind es nicht gewohnt, extreme Hitzewellen zu haben, wie wir sie heute sehen“, sagte sie. Es ist wichtig zu betonen, wie es Hayhoe getan hat, dass dieses Ereignis ernsthafte Risiken für die Gesundheit – insbesondere für Kinder und ältere Menschen – und auch für Nutzpflanzen im gesamten US-Kernland birgt. Sie wies auf eine extreme Hitzewelle im Jahr 2003 hin, die Paris und Europa heimsuchte und die tatsächlich durch statistische Zuordnungsanalysen mit dem Klimawandel in Verbindung gebracht wurde. Dieses Ereignis tötete Hunderte von Menschen in Paris und London, und eine aktuelle Studie führte zumindest einige dieser Todesfälle selbst auf den Klimawandel zurück. Diese Verbindungen sind also real, wenn auch nicht immer einfach zu charakterisieren. Jetzt geht es darum, dieses aktuelle Ereignis genau zu beobachten, Vorbereitungen zu treffen und zu sehen, was Wissenschaftler zu sagen haben, wenn sie ihre Analysen durchführen.

4b68af25	Wissenschaftler, die die massenhafte Freisetzung von Treibhausgasen aus den kohlenstoffreichen, gefrorenen Böden der Arktis befürchten, haben seit einiger Zeit mindestens eine gute Nachricht in ihren Prognosen: Sie sagten voraus, dass der größte Teil des freigesetzten Gases Kohlendioxid sein würde, das, Obwohl es ein Treibhausgas ist, treibt es die Erwärmung langsamer voran als einige andere Gase. Wissenschaftler waren offensichtlich nicht begeistert von mehr Kohlendioxidemissionen, aber es war besser als die Alternative: Methan, ein kurzlebigeres, aber weitaus härteres Gas, das schnellere Erwärmungsschübe verursachen könnte. Jetzt ist sogar dieser Silberstreif am Horizont zweifelhaft. Am Montag veröffentlichte Forschungsergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass Methanfreisetzungen erheblich häufiger auftreten könnten, wenn der arktische Permafrost auftaut. Die Forschung hat ergeben, dass in wassergesättigten Feuchtgebieten, in denen Sauerstoff nicht vorherrscht, winzige Mikroorganismen eine beträchtliche Menge Methan produzieren, ein Gas, das nicht viel länger als ein Jahrzehnt in der Luft verbleibt, aber einen vielfach höheren Erwärmungseffekt als Kohlenstoff hat Kohlendioxid über einen Zeitraum von 100 Jahren. Was wir definitiv sagen können, ist, dass die Bedeutung von Methan in den Kohlenstoffstudien bisher unterschätzt wurde“, sagte Christian Knobloch, Forscher an der Universität Hamburg in Deutschland und Hauptautor der in Nature Climate Change veröffentlichten Studie. Das abweichende Ergebnis kam, nachdem Knoblauch und seine Kollegen ein langwieriges Experiment durchgeführt hatten, das mehr als sieben Jahre dauerte, bei dem sie Flecken von untergetauchtem und künstlich erwärmtem Boden aus Sibirien im Labor überwachten und nach und nach beobachteten, dass empfindliche methanproduzierende Mikroorganismen im Laufe der Zeit immer häufiger wurden. Knoblauch behauptet, dass andere Studien wassergesättigte arktische Böden nicht so lange untersucht haben, und er stellt fest, dass es in einigen Fällen drei Jahre oder länger dauerte, bis die methanerzeugenden Mikroorganismen richtig ankurbelten. „Was wir gesehen haben, ist, dass es sehr lange dauert, bis Methan produziert wird, und die Studie, die wir durchgeführt haben, ist wirklich die erste, die so lang ist“, sagte Knoblauch. Die Forschung wurde zusammen mit Kollegen von mehreren Institutionen in Deutschland durchgeführt , Schweden und Russland. In dem Experiment wurde so viel Methan produziert, dass die Forscher berechneten, dass die Auswirkungen der Treibhausgasemissionen aus feuchten Böden oder Feuchtgebieten höher sein werden als aus trockeneren Böden, wo Kohlendioxid tatsächlich das freigesetzte Topgas sein sollte. Dieser Befund könnte, wenn er weiter bestätigt wird, die Berechnungen des Gesamtpotenzials des Permafrosts, die globale Erwärmung im kommenden Jahrhundert zu verschlimmern, neu ausrichten. Eine große Studie zum Erwärmungspotenzial von Permafrost, die 2015 in der Zeitschrift Nature veröffentlicht wurde, spielte beispielsweise das Potenzial für die Methanfreisetzung in nassen Böden herunter und sagte, trockenere Böden seien das größere Problem. „Trotz des stärkeren Treibhausgases CH4 könnte eine Einheit neu aufgetauten Permafrost-Kohlenstoffs über ein Jahrhundert einen größeren Einfluss auf das Klima haben, wenn er in einem trockeneren, aeroben Boden auftaut und zerfällt, als eine äquivalente Menge Kohlenstoff in einem überschwemmten Boden Boden oder Sediment“, fand diese Forschung heraus. Dem scheint die neue Studie zu widersprechen. Knoblauch warnt jedoch davor, dass mehr Forschung betrieben werden müsste, um von diesen Ergebnissen zu einer Prognose darüber zu gelangen, wie viel Methan in den kommenden Jahrzehnten aus dem Permafrost strömen könnte. Es wird zum Beispiel wichtig sein zu wissen, wie viel aufgetauter Permafrost in wässrigen Bedingungen im Vergleich zu trockenen Bedingungen stecken bleibt. Merritt Turetsky von der University of Guelph, eine Expertin für arktischen Permafrost, die nicht an der Forschung beteiligt war, lobte die neue Studie und merkte an, dass die Forscher lange versucht hätten, das Verhalten winziger methanproduzierender Organismen in wässrigen Böden aufzudecken. Die Forschung, sagte sie, könnte dazu beitragen, die Lücke zwischen Feldstudien von wassergesättigtem Permafrost, die Methanemissionen entdeckt haben, und Laborstudien zu schließen, die die Bedeutung des Gases herunterzuspielen scheinen. „Was an dieser Studie bemerkenswert ist, ist die Zeit, die sie damit verbracht haben, die Gemeinschaften zu verfolgen, und ich denke, das bietet einen möglichen Grund dafür, warum Feld- und Laborstudien nicht miteinander übereinstimmten“, sagte Turetsky. Sie sagte, die Gesamtmenge an Permafrost-Kohlenstoff, die aufgrund der globalen Erwärmung in diesem Jahrhundert anfällig sein könnte – vielleicht 10 Prozent davon, was mehr als genug wäre, um die globalen Klimaziele zu untergraben – werde sich angesichts der neuen Forschung wahrscheinlich nicht ändern. Aber der Anteil dieses Kohlenstoffs, der als Methan emittiert wird, im Gegensatz zu Kohlendioxid, wird entscheidend sein, sagte sie, und muss noch bestimmt werden. „Wir müssen die gesamte Permafrost-Kohlenstofffreisetzung unbedingt in diese beiden Formen aufteilen, weil es wirklich darauf ankommt“, sagte Turetsky. “Also denke ich, dass dies der Ort sein muss, an dem die Community als nächstes hingeht.” Aber Róisín Commane, ein wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter in Harvard, der die arktische Atmosphäre untersucht und auch nicht an dieser Forschung beteiligt war, war skeptischer, sich auf diese Studie zu verlassen, um ein schlechteres Urteil über Methan zu treffen. Die Studie sei „sehr gut gemacht“, sagte sie, aber der Tendenz nasser Böden, Methan zu produzieren, könne durch mehrere Faktoren entgegengewirkt werden. Die Böden könnten auch Gastgeber für Organismen werden, die dieses Methan verschlingen – und es in Kohlendioxid umwandeln. Und da sich die Arktis weiter erwärmt, könnten die Böden möglicherweise nicht so viel Wasser speichern, da das unterirdische Eis, das es an Ort und Stelle hielt, allmählich nachgibt, bemerkte sie. „Wie viel davon in die Atmosphäre gelangt, ist die große Sache“, sagte Commane. „Ökosysteme werden wahrscheinlich mehr Methan produzieren, wenn sie nass bleiben. Die große Frage, die wir haben, ist, wie viel davon in die Atmosphäre gelangt, und ich glaube nicht, dass sie hier auf diese Frage kommen.“	Die Kohlenstoffbombe der Arktis könnte sogar noch stärker sein, als wir dachten	true
34855333	"Seit 2012 diskutieren Wissenschaftler eine komplexe und offen gesagt explosive Idee darüber, wie ein sich erwärmender Planet unser Wetter verändern wird – eine, die, wenn sie richtig ist, tiefgreifende Auswirkungen auf die gesamte nördliche Hemisphäre und insbesondere in ihren mittleren Breiten haben würde, wo Hunderte von Millionen leben von Menschen leben. Die Idee ist, dass der Klimawandel nicht nur die allgemeine Wahrscheinlichkeit von Hitzewellen oder etwa die Niederschlagsmenge erhöht, sondern auch den Wetterfluss selbst verändert. Durch die Veränderung massiver planetarer Luftmuster wie des Jetstreams (Bild oben), der in Wellen von West nach Ost in der nördlichen Hemisphäre fließt, führt ein sich erwärmender Planet dazu, dass unser Wetter festgefahren wird. Dies bedeutet, dass ein bestimmtes Wettermuster, was auch immer es sein mag, länger andauern kann, was zu extremen Dürren, Hitzewellen, Regengüssen und mehr führt. Diese Grundidee hat ein halbes Jahrzehnt lang Kritik und Debatten ausgelöst, und an der Spitze der Forschung setzen sich Wissenschaftler weiterhin damit auseinander. Und nun bekräftigt eine neue Studie noch einmal einen ihrer Kernaspekte. Michael Mann von der Pennsylvania State University und eine Gruppe von Kollegen an Forschungsinstituten in den Vereinigten Staaten, Deutschland und den Niederlanden stellten in Nature Scientific Reports fest, dass sich zumindest im Frühjahr und Sommer die großräumige Strömung der Atmosphäre tatsächlich ändert so dass das Wetter häufiger hängen bleibt. Die Studie, schreiben ihre Autoren, „verstärkt die Beweiskraft für einen menschlichen Einfluss auf das Auftreten verheerender Ereignisse wie der europäischen Hitzewelle 2003, der Flut in Pakistan 2010 und der russischen Hitzewelle, der Hitzewelle in Texas 2011 und den jüngsten Überschwemmungen Europa."" Aber was bedeutet es für die globale Erwärmung, den Jetstream zu verändern? Die grundlegenden Ideen, die hier im Spiel sind, werden schnell kompliziert. Die Studie selbst bezieht sich beispielsweise auf die „quasi-resonante Verstärkung (QRA) von Wellen im synoptischen Maßstab“ als den Schlüsselmechanismus dafür, wie Forscher glauben, dass dies geschieht – eine Terminologie, die Nichtwissenschaftlern weltweit mit Sicherheit Schrecken einflößen wird. Andererseits ist manches davon gar nicht so kompliziert. Der Jetstream der nördlichen Hemisphäre fließt wellenförmig von West nach Ost, angetrieben durch die Erdrotation und den Temperaturunterschied zwischen Äquator und Nordpol. Die Strömung ist stärker, wenn dieser Temperaturunterschied groß ist. Aber wenn sich die Arktis schneller erwärmt als der Äquator – was Teil der grundlegenden Definition der globalen Erwärmung ist und bereits passiert – kann die Strömung des Jetstreams geschwächt und verlängert werden. Dann können Sie die resultierenden Wetterextreme bekommen. „Es ist so, als ob Sie eine elektromagnetische Welle auf ein Koaxialkabel beschränken, dann verlieren Sie keine Energie, sie wird fest in diesem Kabel eingeschlossen und an Ihren Fernseher gesendet“, sagte Mann. „Diese Wellen verlieren keine Energie, also wachsen sie und werden größer und bleiben auch an Ort und Stelle stecken.“ Laut der neuen Studie kann dies vor allem im Sommer vorkommen. Darüber hinaus stellt es fest, dass ein bestimmtes Temperaturmuster mit diesem Verhalten verbunden ist – und dieses Temperaturmuster, das eine besonders warme Arktis aufweist, wird im Laufe der Zeit immer häufiger, basierend sowohl auf Beobachtungen als auch auf einer Überprüfung der Ergebnisse von leistungsstarken Klimawandelmodellen die die Forscher durchgeführt haben. „Wir glauben, dass das Signal in den letzten zehn Jahren aus dem Rauschen entstanden ist“, sagte Mann. Stephen Vavrus von der University of Wisconsin, ein Forscher, der 2012 eine einflussreiche Studie mitverfasst hat, die darauf hindeutet, dass Veränderungen in der Arktis Wetterextreme in den mittleren Breiten antreiben könnten, lobte die neue Forschung in einem am Montag per E-Mail gesendeten Kommentar. „Diese Studie geht über statistische Korrelationen hinaus und untersucht einen spezifischen Prozess, der plausibel erklären kann, wie verstärkte Erwärmungstrends in hohen Breiten Wetterauswirkungen in der Ferne auslösen können“, sagte er. Aber andere wissenschaftliche Autoren haben in der Vergangenheit erhebliche Skepsis gegenüber dieser Art von Ideen geäußert. Eine aktuelle Studie in Nature GeosciOne, der Autor dieser Studie, John Fyfe vom kanadischen Zentrum für Klimamodellierung und -analyse bei Environment and Climate Change Canada, kommentierte das Mann-Papier per E-Mail: „Es ist allgemein bekannt, dass es einen menschlichen Einfluss darauf gegeben hat die großräumige atmosphärische Zirkulation und Temperatur der nördlichen Hemisphäre. Mannet al. stellen eine Theorie auf, die versucht, diese Änderungen mit Änderungen im Spektrum kürzerer Wellen in der Atmosphäre, die unsere Wettermacher sind, in Verbindung zu bringen. Ich glaube nicht, dass diese Theorie vollständig entwickelt ist oder dass die Implikationen vollständig erforscht wurden, aber ich denke, dass Mann et al. Studium ist ein sehr guter Anfang.“ Die aktuelle Studie deckt wirklich nur Wetterextreme im Frühjahr und Sommer ab. Für im Winter auftretende Extreme, sagte Mann, müssen wir nach anderen Mechanismen für seltsames atmosphärisches Verhalten suchen. Nichtsdestotrotz stellt die Arbeit einen weiteren Hinweis darauf dar, dass ein sich änderndes Klima zu einem sich ändernden Muster atmosphärischer Strömungen führt, mit großen Auswirkungen auf das Wetter, das von einem großen Teil der Weltbevölkerung zu spüren ist. Mann, der diese Woche vor dem Kongress in einer Sitzung aussagt, die voraussichtlich eine heftige Debatte über die Schwere des Klimawandels beinhalten wird, kommentierte: „Das wird eine Scheindebatte. Aber diese Dinge sind jetzt die eigentliche Debatte.“ Zum Beispiel stellte er in Frage, ob das Abschmelzen der Arktis und insbesondere der Verlust des Meereises eine winterliche Abkühlung über Eurasien verursacht hat, eine andere Idee, die in den USA aufgegriffen wurde Debatte über den Jetstream und Wetterextreme."

093939cc	Die Bewohner verlassen die Marshallinseln, aber nicht wegen des Klimawandels. Hype und Übertreibung dienen niemandem. Rangiroa-Atoll, Lagune und Korallenriffe aus der Luft. Etwa einmal im Jahr reisen Journalisten großer Nachrichtenagenturen zu den Marshallinseln, einer abgelegenen Kette von Vulkaninseln und Korallenatollen im Pazifischen Ozean, um in panischer Stimme darüber zu berichten, dass der Inselstaat aufgrund des Klimawandels verschwindet. Ihre Meldungen sind oft voller roher Emotionen und deuten darauf hin, dass die Bewohner aus Atollen fliehen, die schnell im Meer versinken. Neue Forschungsergebnisse zeigen jedoch, dass dies nicht das vollständige – oder sogar ein genaues – Bild ist. Dies anzuerkennen bedeutet nicht, dass die globale Erwärmung nicht real ist oder dass die führenden Politiker und Wissenschaftler der Welt die negativen Auswirkungen des Klimawandels nicht angehen sollten, aber Hype und Übertreibung dienen niemandem. Unter Verwendung historischer Luftaufnahmen und hochauflösender Satellitenbilder analysierten die Wissenschaftler Murray Ford und Paul Kench von der Auckland University kürzlich Küstenveränderungen auf sechs Atollen und zwei mittelozeanischen Riffinseln auf den Marshallinseln. Ihre von Experten begutachtete Studie, die in der Septemberausgabe 2015 von Anthropocene veröffentlicht wurde, ergab, dass die gesamte Landfläche der Inseln seit Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts tatsächlich gewachsen ist. Wie ist das möglich? Es scheint selbstverständlich, dass der steigende Meeresspiegel die Landfläche verringern wird. Allerdings gibt es einen Akkretionsprozess, bei dem von den Wellen zertrümmerte Korallen als Sand auf diese tief liegenden Inseln gespült werden und so der Abnahme der Landmasse entgegenwirken. Untersuchungen zeigen, dass dieser Prozess die Erosion durch den Anstieg des Meeresspiegels überwältigt und zu einem Nettogewinn an Landfläche führt. Das gilt nicht nur für die Marshallinseln. Die Forscher schreiben, dass es in den „kürzlich aufkommenden Studien zu Küstenveränderungen auf Atollinseln kaum Hinweise auf eine weit verbreitete Erosion von Riffinseln gibt. Im Gegenteil, mehrere Studien haben seit Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts eine bemerkenswerte Ausbreitung der Küstenlinie [Wachstum] und Positionsänderungen von Inseln dokumentiert, die zu einer Nettozunahme der Inselfläche führten.“ Die berühmteste dieser Studien, die 2010 von Paul Kench und Arthur Webb von der South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission in Fidschi veröffentlicht wurde, zeigte, dass 27 pazifische Inseln 14 % Fläche verloren haben. Dennoch gewannen 43 % an Fläche hinzu, während der Rest stabil blieb. Vertreter der Marshallinseln haben sich lautstark für die Notwendigkeit entschiedener globaler Maßnahmen zum Klimaschutz ausgesprochen. Präsidentin Hilda Heine hat Reportern gesagt, dass langjährige Einwohner die Marshallinseln verlassen, weil der Klimawandel die Existenz der Nation bedroht. Es stimmt, dass etwa ein Drittel der Bevölkerung in die USA umgesiedelt ist – aber aus banalen Gründen als dem Klimawandel. Laut der Asiatischen Entwicklungsbank leben etwa 52,7 % der Bevölkerung der Marshallinseln unterhalb der Armutsgrenze. Nur 39,3 % der Bevölkerung ab 15 Jahren sind erwerbstätig. In seinem Menschenrechtsbericht 2015 über den Inselstaat sagte das US-Außenministerium, dass zu den erheblichen Problemen „chronische Regierungskorruption und chronische häusliche Gewalt“ sowie „Kindesmissbrauch, Sexhandel und fehlende gesetzliche Bestimmungen zum Schutz der Arbeitnehmerrechte“ gehören. ” Marshallesische Bürger haben auch einen einfachen Einwanderungsweg nach Amerika und können ohne Visum in den USA leben, arbeiten und studieren. Es ist verständlich, warum die Führer der Marshallinseln es vorziehen, über die globale Erwärmung zu sprechen. Aber die Schuld für die heutige Auswanderung dem steigenden Meer zuzuschreiben, erweist allen einen Bärendienst. Den Zuschauern in den USA deutlich zu sagen, dass sie „diese Insel verschwinden lassen“, wie es ein Bericht von John Sutter von CNN im Juni 2015 tat, sorgt für gutes, mit Schuld beladenes Fernsehen. Aber diese reduktionistische, faktenfeindliche Rhetorik trägt zu der Idee bei, dass die Diskussion über den Klimawandel ein zweiseitiger, karikaturistischer Kampf zwischen denen sein sollte, die sagen, dass er nicht real ist, und denen, die sagen, er sei das schlimmste Problem der Menschheit. Noch heimtückischer macht uns die Untergangsstimmung Panik und wir ergreifen die falschen Antworten auf die globale Erwärmung. Mit Kosten zwischen 1 Billion und 2 Billionen US-Dollar pro Jahr dürfte das Pariser Klimaabkommen, das kürzlich von China ratifiziert wurde, das teuerste Abkommen der Geschichte sein. Es wird das weltweite Wirtschaftswachstum verlangsamen, um eine Umstellung auf ineffiziente grüne Energiequellen zu erzwingen. Damit wird fast nichts erreicht. Meine von Fachleuten begutachtete Forschung, die letzten November in der Zeitschrift Global Policy veröffentlicht wurde, zeigt, dass selbst wenn jede Nation alle ihre Versprechen zur Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen bis 2030 erfüllen und sich das ganze Jahrhundert daran halten würde – zu einem Preis von mehr als 100 US-Dollar Billionen an verlorenem BIP – der globale Temperaturanstieg würde um winzige 0,3 °F (0,17 °C) reduziert. In der Eile, etwas zu unternehmen – und als drastische Maßnahmen wahrgenommen zu werden – wurden vernünftigere Ansätze zur Bekämpfung der globalen Erwärmung übersehen. Anstatt einfach weniger CO2-Ausstoß vorzuschreiben, brauchen wir mehr F&E-Ausgaben für grüne Energie, einschließlich effizienterer Spaltung und Fusion, billigerer Sonnen- und Windenergie und verbesserter Speicherung. Neue Technologien sind entscheidend, wenn grüne Energie fossilen Brennstoffen den Rang ablaufen soll. Politische Entscheidungsträger, die den Bewohnern der Marshallinseln heute helfen wollen, sollten sich darum kümmern, die Widerstandsfähigkeit der Inseln und ihre Fähigkeit zur Bewältigung von Unwettern zu verbessern, indem sie die Infrastruktur und die Sturmvorsorge verbessern. Die Bekämpfung von Problemen wie Armut, Gesundheitsfürsorge, Korruption und häuslicher Gewalt würde noch mehr bewirken. Wer helfen will, sollte das große Ganze im Auge behalten.

f29c8cca	"Temperaturen, Meeresspiegel und Kohlendioxid haben alle Meilensteine ​​​​bei extremem Wetter im Jahr 2015 erreicht, findet der große internationale Bericht zur Lage des Klimas. Ein Wissenschaftler springt während einer Reise zum grönländischen Eisschild, das im vergangenen Jahr auf mehr als 50 % seiner Oberfläche geschmolzen war, über Wasser. Die Welt bewegt sich auf eine Umwelt zu, die der Mensch noch nie zuvor erlebt hat, wobei die Temperatur der Luft und der Ozeane Rekorde bricht, der Meeresspiegel historische Höchststände erreicht und das Kohlendioxid einen wichtigen Meilenstein überschreitet, so ein wichtiger internationaler Bericht. Der „State of the Climate“-Bericht, der von der National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) mit Beiträgen von Hunderten von Wissenschaftlern aus 62 Ländern geleitet wurde, bestätigte, dass es einen „Umsturz mehrerer symbolischer Meilensteine“ in Bezug auf Hitze, Anstieg des Meeresspiegels und extremes Wetter gegeben hat im Jahr 2015. Die Klimakrise ist bereits da – aber niemand sagt uns, George Monbiot „Die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels sind nicht länger subtil“, sagte Michael Mann, ein führender Klimatologe an der Penn State, gegenüber dem Guardian. „Sie spielen sich in Echtzeit vor uns ab. Die Zahlen von 2015 machen das deutlich.“ Grafik mit globalen Temperaturen Das vergangene Jahr war das wärmste seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen, wobei die jährliche Oberflächentemperatur die vorherige Marke von 2014 um 0,1 °C übertraf. Das bedeutet, dass die Welt heute 1 °C wärmer ist als in vorindustriellen Zeiten, was hauptsächlich auf eine enorme Zunahme der Treibhausgasproduktion zurückzuführen ist. Die UN hat bereits gesagt, dass 2016 höchstwahrscheinlich den Jahresrekord erneut brechen wird, nach 14 aufeinanderfolgenden Monaten extremer Hitze, unterstützt durch ein heftiges El Niño-Klimaereignis, ein Wetterereignis, das normalerweise die Temperaturen auf der ganzen Welt erhöht. Die Ozeane, die mehr als 90 % des zusätzlich in die Atmosphäre gepumpten CO2 absorbieren, erreichten ebenfalls eine neue Rekordtemperatur, mit starken Spitzen im von El Niño dominierten Ostpazifik, der 2 ° C wärmer war als der langjährige Durchschnitt, und der Arktis, wo die Temperatur im August schwindelerregende 8 °C über dem Durchschnitt erreichte. Diagramm zur Erwärmung der Ozeane Die thermische Ausdehnung der Ozeane, verstärkt durch schmelzende Gletscher, führte 2015 zum höchsten globalen Meeresspiegel seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen. Die Ozeane sind etwa 70 mm höher als der Durchschnitt von 1993, als umfassende Satellitenmessungen des Meeresspiegels begannen. Die Meere steigen mit einer durchschnittlichen Rate von 3,3 mm pro Jahr, wobei der westliche Pazifik und der Indische Ozean die schnellsten Anstiege verzeichnen. Angetrieben werden diese Veränderungen durch eine CO2-Konzentration, die im vergangenen Jahr an der Forschungsstation Mauna Loa auf Hawaii die symbolische Marke von 400 Teilen pro Million überschritten hat. Der Noaa-Bericht besagt, dass der globale CO2-Gehalt mit 399,4 ppm einen Hauch darunter lag, ein Anstieg von 2,2 ppm im Vergleich zu 2014. Diagramm zeigt Kohlendioxidwerte Noaa sagte, dass andere „bemerkenswerte“ Veränderungen im Jahr 2015 die niedrigste maximale Meereisausdehnung der Arktis beinhalten in der 37-jährigen Satellitenaufzeichnung, die im Februar 2015 aufgezeichnet wurde. Die Alpengletscher der Welt verzeichneten das 36. Jahr in Folge einen jährlichen Netto-Eisverlust, und der grönländische Eisschild, der den Meeresspiegel um etwa 7 m ansteigen lassen würde, wenn er sich auflösen würde, schmolz mehr als 50 % seiner Oberfläche.
Die schnellen Klimaveränderungen können tiefgreifende Folgen für Menschen und andere Arten haben. Im Juni letzten Jahres forderte eine schwere Hitzewelle in Karatschi, Pakistan, über 1.000 Menschenleben. Eine schwere Dürre führte zu Nahrungsmittelknappheit für Millionen von Menschen in Äthiopien, und fehlende Niederschläge führten zu „intensiven und weit verbreiteten“ Waldbränden in Indonesien, die eine große Menge an Treibhausgasen ausspuckten. Das schwindende Meereis veranlasst große Walrossherden, sich an Land zu ziehen. Arktische Meeresarten wie Schneckenfische und Polarkabeljau werden von Arten, die weiter südlich kommen und von den wärmenden Gewässern angezogen werden, aus der Region verdrängt. Eine riesige Algenblüte vor der Westküste Nordamerikas hat Meereslebewesen und Fischerei geschädigt. Grafik zeigt Meeresspiegel Wissenschaftler haben gesagt, dass zugrunde liegende Trends des Klimawandels im Spiel sind, aber das letzte Jahr wurde auch durch das starke El Niño-Ereignis beeinflusst, bei dem sich die Gewässer des äquatorialen Pazifiks erwärmen, was zu einer Reihe von Wettereffekten auf der ganzen Welt führt. El Niño hat 2016 ebenfalls dazu beigetragen, die sengende Hitze anzuheizen, ist aber jetzt abgeebbt. Thomas Karl, Direktor der nationalen Umweltinformationszentren von Noaa, sagte, dass das Klima des vergangenen Jahres „sowohl durch langfristige Veränderungen als auch durch ein El-Niño-Ereignis geprägt war. Wenn wir darüber nachdenken, klimaresistent zu sein, müssen diese beiden Zeitskalen berücksichtigt werden. „Der letztjährige El Niño war eine deutliche Erinnerung daran, wie kurzfristige Ereignisse den relativen Einfluss und die Auswirkungen längerfristiger Erwärmungstrends verstärken können.“ Kate Willett, leitende Wissenschaftlerin am britischen Met Office, sagte, dass es eine 75-prozentige jährliche Erwärmung gebe Zunahme der Fläche, die letztes Jahr von schwerer Dürre betroffen war. „Wenn man sich eine Reihe von Klimamessungen ansieht, war 2015 ein weiteres sehr bedeutsames Jahr“, sagte sie. „2015 war nicht nur das mit Abstand wärmste Jahr seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen, es war auch ein weiteres Jahr, in dem die Werte der dominierenden Treibhausgase neue Höchststände erreichten.“ Der Stand des Klimaberichts geht nun in sein 26. Jahr. Die Peer-Review-Reihe wird jährlich von der American Meteorological Society veröffentlicht."	Umweltrekorde erschüttert, da der Klimawandel „vor uns spielt“	true
bda1ddd2	Bill Shorten und seine Verbündeten, die Wirtschaftsvandalen der Grünen, glauben, dass der Klimawandel ein moralisches Problem ist. Also sagt man die Wahrheit. Mit seiner Elite-Privatschulausbildung hätte der Oppositionsführer etwas über die römische Erwärmung, das Mittelalter, die mittelalterliche Erwärmung und die kleine Eiszeit gelernt. Diese fanden vor der Industrialisierung statt und wurden alle von Veränderungen der Sonne angetrieben. Er hätte gelernt, dass natürliche warme Zeiten wie jetzt großen Wohlstand, längere Lebensdauer und weniger Krankheiten bringen, während Jack Frost Tod, Entvölkerung und wirtschaftlichen Stress bringt. In der Biologie hätte der Labour-Führer etwas über den Darwinismus und die Anpassung der Arten an die Umwelt gelernt. Menschen leben auf Eis und in den Hügeln, Tälern, Tropen und Wüsten, in Höhenlagen und in Küstenebenen. Wie unzählige andere Organismen bewegen wir uns und passen uns an, wenn sich die Umwelt verändert. Arten gedeihen, wenn es warm ist. WEITER LESEN QANDA WRAP Sollten olympische Athleten zuerst geimpft werden? JOSEPH LAM Von seiner Ausbildung an einer religiösen Schule hätte er etwas über den Apostel Thomas erfahren. Eine der Stärken unserer westlichen Zivilisation sind Zweifel und Skepsis. Sicherlich glaubt Shorten nicht an den von grünen Aktivisten und eigennützigen angeblichen Experten auf Kosten der Nation geförderten Katastrophenismus. Tut er dies, ist er nicht wählbar. Wenn er wissentlich eine Unwahrheit fördert, ist er nicht wählbar. Kritisches Denken war grundlegend für unsere Kultur und sollte in die Politikformulierung einbezogen werden. In der Schulwissenschaft hätte Shorten gelernt, dass Kohlendioxid die Nahrung des Lebens ist und ohne dieses Erdgas, das im Weltraum und auf allen Planeten vorkommt, gäbe es kein Leben. Er würde auch aus seinem Mathematikunterricht verstehen, dass, wenn 3 Prozent der gesamten jährlichen globalen Kohlendioxidemissionen vom Menschen stammen und Australien 1,3 Prozent dieser 3 Prozent produziert, dann keine Menge an Emissionsreduktionen hier irgendwelche Auswirkungen auf das globale Klima haben wird . Eine schnelle Suche würde ihm zeigen, dass bei jeder Explosion von Pflanzen in der Vergangenheit der Kohlendioxidgehalt viel höher war als heute. Wenn wir den Kohlendioxidgehalt der Atmosphäre halbieren, stirbt alles Leben. Shorten sollte wissen, dass sich die Erde seit Jahrtausenden verändert, mit Zyklen und einmaligen Ereignissen wie einem Asteroideneinschlag, einem Supervulkan oder einer Supernova-Explosion. Er sollte wissen, dass sich das Klima ständig ändert und dass der Planet in ernsthafte Schwierigkeiten geraten würde, wenn dies nicht der Fall wäre. Es gibt Kreisläufe von Luft, Wasser, Felsen und Kontinenten. Es gibt messbare Zyklen mit Sonne, Erdumlaufbahn, Ozeanen und Mond, die den Klimawandel vorantreiben, insbesondere wenn Zyklen zusammenfallen. Es muss noch nachgewiesen werden, dass sich der Klimawandel heute von dem der Vergangenheit unterscheidet. Trotz Ausgaben in Höhe von Hunderten von Milliarden Dollar in den letzten Jahrzehnten ist immer noch nicht bewiesen worden, dass menschliche Kohlendioxidemissionen die globale Erwärmung vorantreiben. Doch Wind- und Solarindustriekomplexe sprengen die Landschaft, angeblich um die Kohlendioxidemissionen zu reduzieren. Sie laufen mit Subventionen, nicht mit Wind oder Sonne. Wind und Sonne transferieren Geld von den Armen zu den Reichen und schonen nicht die Umwelt. Diese Subventionen, die von den leidenden Verbrauchern und Arbeitgebern gezahlt werden, erhöhen die Emissionen, da Kohlestrom für Zeiten ohne Wind und Sonnenschein bereitgehalten werden muss. Die Energiemenge, die beim Bau von Solar- und Windkraftanlagen verbraucht wird, ist größer, als sie in ihrem Arbeitsleben produzieren. Bei Bau und Instandhaltung wird weitaus mehr Kohlendioxid freigesetzt als eingespart. Erneuerbare Energien wie Windturbinen sind ökologisch katastrophal, weil sie eine riesige Landfläche verschmutzen, Vögel und Fledermäuse in Scheiben schneiden und würfeln, Insekten töten, die Vogelfutter sind, Gesundheitsprobleme für Menschen verursachen, die nur wenige Kilometer von ihnen entfernt leben, Giftstoffe rund um den Turbinenstandort hinterlassen und plündern die Landschaft. Rentenfonds der Union haben massiv in erneuerbare Energien investiert. Das Versprechen von Labour, 50 Prozent erneuerbare Energien zu verwenden, wird die Stromverbraucher Hunderte von Milliarden kosten, aber den Gewerkschaften zugute kommen. Sobald Erneuerbare Energien ans Netz gingen, stiegen die Strompreise und die Lieferung wurde unzuverlässig. Gestiegene Stromkosten haben zu Arbeitslosigkeit geführt, und viele Rentner und Arme können sich Strom nicht leisten. Eine Zunahme der Erneuerbaren wird die Sache noch verschlimmern. Berücksichtigt Shortens Energiepolitik diejenigen, die Arbeitsplätze verlieren und denen der Strom abgeschaltet wird, in seinem Rennen um 50 Prozent erneuerbare Energien, um die Taschen seiner Gewerkschaftskollegen zu füllen? Und was ist mit den Betrügereien, die zig Milliarden abschöpfen, die als CO2-Zertifikate, CO2-Handel und Zertifikate für erneuerbare Energien um die Welt schwappen? Anstatt dieses Geld den Armen über höhere Strompreise abzunehmen, wäre es besser, es zu Hause auszugeben. Selbstgefällig zu behaupten, dass berechtigte Fragen zu Energiekosten dumm oder betrügerisch sind, ist eine laute Warnglocke. Shorten weigert sich, uns zu sagen, wie er unser Geld ausgeben wird, oder uns Einzelheiten über Energiesysteme zu nennen, die nachweislich ausgefallen sind. Es ist unser Geld, und wenn er uns die finanziellen Details nicht mitteilt, sollten wir große Angst vor seiner Verschlagenheit haben.

80c3c5b8	"Klimawandel: Wissenschaftler haben gerade eine riesige, bisher unbekannte Stickstoffquelle entdeckt. Warum ist das wichtig? Weil es diese düsteren Prognosen zur globalen Erwärmung dramatisch ändern könnte, von denen jeder behauptet, dass sie auf „feststehender Wissenschaft“ beruhen. Die Forscher, deren Ergebnisse in der renommierten Fachzeitschrift Science veröffentlicht wurden, sagten, sie hätten festgestellt, dass die Vorstellung, dass die einzige Stickstoffquelle für Pflanzen aus der Luft käme, falsch sei. Es gibt riesige Lagerhäuser im Grundgestein des Planeten, von denen sich auch Pflanzen ernähren.
Dies sind möglicherweise große Neuigkeiten, da es bedeutet, dass es ein weitaus größeres Stickstoffangebot gibt als bisher angenommen. Ben Houlton, Umweltwissenschaftler und Mitautor der Studie von der University of California at Davis, sagt: „Dies widerspricht dem jahrhundertealten Paradigma, das die Grundlage für die Umweltwissenschaften gelegt hat.“ Achten Sie genau auf das Wort „Paradigma“. Wenn Houltons Erkenntnis über diese riesigen, bisher unbekannten Stickstoffvorräte zutrifft, dann hätte dies einen enormen Einfluss auf die Vorhersagen zur globalen Erwärmung. Klimawissenschaftler wissen seit langem, dass Pflanzen einen Teil der Auswirkungen des Klimawandels ausgleichen, indem sie CO2 aufnehmen und speichern. Klimawissenschaftler gingen jedoch davon aus, dass die Fähigkeit von Pflanzen, diese Funktion zu erfüllen, begrenzt war, weil die Verfügbarkeit von Stickstoff in der Atmosphäre begrenzt war. Wie eine 2003 im gleichen Science-Journal veröffentlichte Studie es ausdrückte: „Es wird nicht genug Stickstoff zur Verfügung stehen, um die Szenarien mit hoher Kohlenstoffaufnahme aufrechtzuerhalten.“
Nach den neuesten Erkenntnissen sagte Ronald Amundson, ein Bodenbiogeochemiker an der University of California in Berkeley, gegenüber Chemical and Engineering News: „Wenn dort mehr Stickstoff vorhanden ist als erwartet, dann werden die Einschränkungen des Pflanzenwachstums in einer Welt mit hohem CO2-Ausstoß vielleicht nicht so toll, wie wir denken."" Mit anderen Worten, mit mehr verfügbarem Stickstoff könnte die Pflanzenwelt möglicherweise mehr CO2 aufnehmen, als Klimawissenschaftler geschätzt haben, was bedeutet, dass sich der Planet nicht so stark erwärmen wird, obwohl die Menschheit CO2 in die Atmosphäre pumpt. Ein atemberaubender Fund Houlton erforscht diese Möglichkeit seit Jahren. Bereits 2011 berichtete er, dass Waldbäume Stickstoff aus Gestein anzapfen können.
Damals sagte er: „Die erstaunliche Erkenntnis, dass Wälder sich auch von Stickstoff in Gesteinen ernähren können, hat das Potenzial, alle Prognosen in Bezug auf den Klimawandel zu ändern“, weil dies bedeutete, dass an Land mehr Kohlenstoff und weniger in der Atmosphäre gespeichert werden könnte als im Klima Modelle sagen. Die Frage ist, ob irgendwelche Klimawissenschaftler oder Umweltschützer – die der Vorstellung verfallen sind, dass die Industrialisierung den Planeten zerstört – dies jemals zugeben würden.
Deshalb ist das Wort „Paradigma“ wichtig. Wie wir an dieser Stelle angemerkt haben, widersetzt sich die von Umweltschützern und Politikern verbreitete Idee der „sesshaften Wissenschaft“ der Geschichte der Wissenschaft, die wiederholte Umwälzungen früherer Formen der „sesshaften Wissenschaft“ erlebt hat.
Thomas Kuhn untersuchte dieses Phänomen 1962 in seinem Buch „Die Struktur wissenschaftlicher Revolutionen“. Er erklärte, wie Wissenschaftler eine Theorie – oder ein Paradigma – basierend auf verfügbaren Beweisen entwickeln, um zu erklären, was sie sehen.
Sobald sich dieses Paradigma durchgesetzt hat, geben Wissenschaftler es oft nur ungern auf, selbst wenn sich Beweise dafür häufen, dass es falsch sein könnte. Schließlich weichen fehlerhafte Paradigmen jedoch und leiten ein neues wissenschaftliches Paradigma ein. Beispiele für solche Paradigmenwechsel in der Vergangenheit: heliozentrisches Sonnensystem, Kontinentaldrift, Einsteins Theorien. Ein bevorstehender Paradigmenwechsel? Das Gleiche könnte gerade jetzt mit der Klimawissenschaft passieren.
Wie wir schon oft gesagt haben, zeigen Beweise weiterhin Schwächen in Klimamodellen, die zur Vorhersage der zukünftigen Erwärmung verwendet werden. Sie konnten eine jahrzehntelange Pause der globalen Temperaturen nicht vorhersagen. Auch sind verschiedene Katastrophen, die inzwischen eingetreten sein sollten, nicht eingetreten. Und ein kürzlich in Nature veröffentlichtes Papier kam zu dem Schluss, dass der Planet weniger empfindlich auf CO2-Anstiege reagiert, als die Computermodelle vermuten lassen.
Unterdessen hat die National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration höchst verdächtige Manipulationen von Temperaturdaten durchgeführt. Die Änderungen der Temperaturdaten lassen die Vergangenheit durchweg kühler erscheinen, was wiederum die Gegenwart wärmer erscheinen lässt.
Dies erzeugt eine Datenillusion ständig steigender Temperaturen, die dem Anstieg des CO2 in der Erdatmosphäre entsprechen. Marc Morano, Herausgeber des beliebten ClimateDepot-Blogs und Autor von „The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change“, stellt fest, dass „Wissenschaft kein politisch vorgegebenes Ergebnis haben soll, das von Ideologie und Politik vorangetrieben wird. Diese neue Stickstoffstudie ist nur ein Beispiel dafür Konsenswissenschaft wird umgestoßen. Das wissenschaftliche Establishment zur globalen Erwärmung sollte jetzt offen sein für ähnliche Studien und abweichende Stimmen zu CO2, um den angeblichen Konsens über den Klimawandel zu kippen.“ Aber werden sie? Angesichts ihres guten Rufs und der enormen Summen staatlicher Zuwendungen, die auf dem Spiel stehen, ist es unwahrscheinlich, dass viele Klimawissenschaftler jemals zugeben würden, dass sie sich geirrt haben. Egal wie offensichtlich es wurde, dass sie es waren."	Eine verblüffende neue Entdeckung könnte all diese Weltuntergangsprognosen zur globalen Erwärmung zunichte machen	partially false
0fc59c8b	Die Erde ist ein Planet im Umbruch, sagen Wissenschaftler, da die World Meteorological Organization Analysen der jüngsten Hitzehöchststände und Eistiefs veröffentlicht. Ein Boot liegt im trockenen Cedro-Stausee in Quixadá, Brasilien. Der Klimawandel erhöht das Risiko extremer Wetterereignisse wie Dürren. Die rekordverdächtige Hitze, die 2016 zum heißesten Jahr aller Zeiten machte, hat sich bis 2017 fortgesetzt und die Welt laut der World Meteorological Organization in „wirklich unbekanntes Gebiet“ gedrängt. Die am Dienstag veröffentlichte WMO-Bewertung des Klimas 2016 berichtet von beispielloser Hitze auf der ganzen Welt, außergewöhnlich niedrigem Eis an beiden Polen und einem sprunghaften Anstieg des Meeresspiegels. Die globale Erwärmung wird größtenteils durch Emissionen menschlicher Aktivitäten verursacht, aber ein starker El Niño – ein natürlicher Klimazyklus – trug 2016 zur Hitze bei. Der El Niño lässt jetzt nach, aber die Extreme sind weiterhin zu sehen, mit Temperaturrekorden, die hereinbrechen die USA im Februar und polare Hitzewellen, die die Eisbedeckung auf neue Tiefststände drücken. „Auch ohne einen starken El Niño im Jahr 2017 sehen wir andere bemerkenswerte Veränderungen auf dem ganzen Planeten, die die Grenzen unseres Verständnisses des Klimasystems in Frage stellen. Wir befinden uns jetzt auf wirklich unbekanntem Terrain“, sagte David Carlson, Direktor des Weltklimaforschungsprogramms der WMO. „Die Erde ist ein Planet im Umbruch aufgrund von menschengemachten Veränderungen in der Atmosphäre“, sagte Jeffrey Kargel, Glaziologe an der University of Arizona in den USA. „Im Allgemeinen helfen sich drastisch ändernde Bedingungen der Zivilisation nicht, die von Stabilität lebt.“ Der WMO-Bericht war „verblüffend“, sagte Prof. David Reay, ein Emissionsexperte an der Universität Edinburgh: „Die Notwendigkeit konzertierter Maßnahmen gegen den Klimawandel war noch nie so groß und der Einsatz so hoch.“ Die neue WMO-Bewertung veranlasste auch einige Wissenschaftler, Donald Trump zu kritisieren. „Während die Daten einen immer größeren Einfluss menschlicher Aktivitäten auf das Klimasystem zeigen, stecken die Trump-Administration und hochrangige Republikaner im Kongress weiterhin den Kopf in den Sand“, sagte Prof. Sir Robert Watson, ein angesehener Klimawissenschaftler an der britischen Universität East Anglia und ein ehemaliger Leiter des UN-Klimawissenschaftsgremiums. „Unsere Kinder und Enkelkinder werden auf die Klimaleugner zurückblicken und sich fragen, wie sie den Planeten zugunsten billiger fossiler Energieträger hätten opfern können, wenn die Kosten der Untätigkeit die Kosten eines Übergangs zu einer kohlenstoffarmen Wirtschaft übersteigen“, sagte Watson genannt. Trump will die Klimaforschung kürzen. Aber der Generalsekretär der WMO, Petteri Taalas, sagte: „Fortlaufende Investitionen in die Klimaforschung und -beobachtung sind von entscheidender Bedeutung, wenn unser wissenschaftliches Wissen mit dem rasanten Tempo des Klimawandels Schritt halten soll.“ 2016 war der heißeste globale Durchschnitt unter den Thermometermessungen, der bis ins Jahr 1880 zurückreicht. Aber wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zeigen, dass es auf der Welt zuletzt vor etwa 115.000 Jahren so warm war und dass der Planet seit 4 Millionen Jahren nicht mehr so ​​hohe Kohlendioxidwerte in der Atmosphäre erlebt hat. 2017 sind die Temperaturrekorde weiter gesunken, in den USA, wo der Februar außergewöhnlich warm war, und in Australien, wo viele Bundesstaaten von anhaltender und extremer Hitze heimgesucht wurden. An den Polen waren die Folgen besonders deutlich. „Die arktischen Eisbedingungen verfolgen seit Oktober Rekordtiefs und halten sechs aufeinanderfolgende Monate an, etwas, das in den [vier Jahrzehnten] Satellitendatenaufzeichnungen noch nie zuvor gesehen wurde“, sagte Prof. Julienne Stroeve vom University College London im Vereinigten Königreich. „Drüben auf der Südhalbkugel hat das Meereis auch neue Rekordtiefs bei den saisonalen Höchst- und Mindestausdehnungen durchbrochen, was zu der geringsten Menge an weltweitem Meereis geführt hat, die jemals aufgezeichnet wurde.“ Aalgras wächst im Sediment von Lowell’s Cove, Maine, USA. Der Anstieg des Meeresspiegels hat diesen einst felsigen Ort ruiniert. Emily Shuckburgh vom British Antarctic Survey sagte: „Die Arktis mag abgelegen sein, aber Veränderungen, die dort auftreten, wirken sich direkt auf uns aus. Das Abschmelzen des grönländischen Eisschilds trägt bereits erheblich zum Anstieg des Meeresspiegels bei, und neue Forschungsergebnisse zeigen, dass das Abschmelzen des arktischen Meereises die Wetterbedingungen in Europa, Asien und Nordamerika verändern kann.“ Zwischen November 2014 und Februar 2016 stieg der globale Meeresspiegel sprunghaft an, wobei das Ereignis El Niño dazu beitrug, dass die Ozeane um 15 mm ansteigen. Dieser Sprung hätte unter dem stetigen Anstieg der letzten Jahrzehnte fünf Jahre gedauert, da die Eiskappen schmelzen und die Ozeane wärmer werden und ihr Volumen ausdehnen. Endgültige Daten für den Anstieg des Meeresspiegels im Jahr 2016 müssen noch veröffentlicht werden. Der Klimawandel schadet den Menschen am unmittelbarsten, indem er das Risiko extremer Wetterereignisse erhöht, und der WMO-Bericht stellt fest, dass diese erhöhten Risiken zunehmend kalkulierbar sind. Zum Beispiel werden die arktischen Hitzewellen zehnmal wahrscheinlicher gemacht und die steigenden Temperaturen, die im Februar in Australien beobachtet wurden, wurden doppelt so wahrscheinlich gemacht. „Da der Kohlendioxidgehalt in der Atmosphäre ständig neue Rekorde bricht, wird der Einfluss menschlicher Aktivitäten auf das Klimasystem immer offensichtlicher“, sagte Taalas.

c9a710dc	Hillary Clintons Flugzeug fliegt am 11. Oktober 2016 über Manhattan, als sie New York auf dem Weg zu einer Veranstaltung zum Klimawandel mit dem ehemaligen Vizepräsidenten Al Gore in Miami, Florida, verlässt. Hillary Clinton und Al Gore sprachen am 11. Oktober am Miami-Dade College über die „Klimakrise“, von der Gore uns seit 20 Jahren zu überzeugen versucht. Genau wie in Gores Film An Inconvenient Truth wurden Wetterkatastrophen, die es immer wieder gab, umfunktioniert, um die Erzählung über den Klimawandel zu unterstützen, mit der Behauptung, dass diese Katastrophen schlimmer werden. Unterdessen hat die Chapman University eine Umfrage zu den zehn wichtigsten Themen veröffentlicht, die die Amerikaner am meisten fürchten. Erraten Sie, was? Der Klimawandel hat es nicht auf die Liste geschafft. Stattdessen war die Korruption von Politikern die Sorge Nr. 1. Für diejenigen, die die Beziehung zwischen diesen beiden berichtenswerten Ereignissen nicht sehen, lassen Sie mich die Punkte für Sie verbinden. Die globale Erwärmung und der Klimawandel, auch wenn er zu 100 % vom Menschen verursacht wird, vollziehen sich so langsam, dass er von niemandem zu Lebzeiten beobachtet werden kann. Hurrikane, Tornados, Überschwemmungen, Dürren und andere Naturkatastrophen haben noch keine offensichtlichen langfristigen Veränderungen gezeigt. Das bedeutet, dass Politiker normale Wetterkatastrophen in „Beweise“ für den Klimawandel verwandeln müssen, damit sie politische Ziele voranbringen können (wie z. B. den Massen teure Solarenergie aufzuzwingen oder eine CO2-Steuer einzuführen). Als Klimaforscher stimme ich zu, dass der Mensch wahrscheinlich zu einem Teil der jüngsten Erwärmung beigetragen hat. Ich bin weder ein Leugner des natürlichen noch des vom Menschen verursachten Klimawandels. Aber die beobachtete Erwärmung, die von Satelliten (unserem einzigen wirklich globalen Überwachungssystem) überwacht wird, war nur etwa die Hälfte dessen, was laut computergestützten Klimamodellen passieren sollte. Darüber hinaus ist die allgemeine Zunahme von Dingen wie Hurrikanen und Tornados nicht eingetreten. Die Dürre im Westen der USA verblasst im Vergleich zu den Mega-Dürren, die uns Baumringe in vergangenen Jahrhunderten verraten. Seebodensedimente in Florida sagen uns, dass die Aktivität großer Hurrikane im Golf von Mexiko in letzter Zeit weniger häufig war als in den vergangenen Jahrhunderten. Starke Stürme vom Typ Sandy treten jedes Jahr in allen großen Ozeanbecken auf … sie treffen nur nicht zufällig große Ballungsräume. Es ist jetzt, selbst nach dem Hurrikan Matthew, über 4.000 Tage her, seit ein schwerer Hurrikan (Kategorie 3 oder stärker) in den USA auf Land traf nur 1 Zoll alle zehn Jahre. Wenn sich ein großer Hurrikan mit einer vorhergesagten Sturmflut von 10-14 Fuß nähert, werden Sie sich dann wirklich Sorgen über einen Meeresspiegelanstieg von 1 Zoll pro Jahrzehnt machen? Wenn Hillary ihr Beispiel des Meeresspiegelanstiegs in Norfolk, Virginia, überprüft hätte, hätte sie herausgefunden, dass die Experten bereits wissen, dass dies hauptsächlich auf das Absinken des Landes dort zurückzuführen ist. Das Ausmaß, in dem die Kosten von Wetterkatastrophen im Laufe der Zeit gestiegen sind, ist bekanntlich darauf zurückzuführen, dass die moderne Gesellschaft mehr Infrastruktur in Gebieten baut, die anfällig für Wetterschäden sind – und das ist fast überall der Fall. Um die Massen zu alarmieren, müssen Politiker also behaupten, dass das, was normal ist, tatsächlich anormal ist – und sich verschlimmert. Und außerdem, dass nur sie es reparieren können … und dadurch Ihre Kinder und Enkelkinder retten können. Und es ist diese „Lösung“, die jeden aktuellen Plan der Politiker zur Bekämpfung des Klimawandels wirklich zunichte macht. Sogar der moderne Pate der globalen Erwärmung, der ehemalige Direktor des NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, James Hansen, hat zugegeben, dass das Pariser Klimaabkommen „wirklich ein Betrug, eine Fälschung“ ist. Denn selbst wenn die Länder der Welt zustimmen, das zu tun, was sie in Bezug auf den Klimawandel versprochen haben, und dass der Klimawandel ausschließlich unsere Schuld ist und der Klimawandel letztendlich wirklich schlimm wird, werden die versprochenen Maßnahmen keine messbaren Auswirkungen auf die Zukunft haben global Temperaturen. Sie sehen, viele der Länder, die das Pariser Abkommen unterzeichnet haben, verpflichten sich nicht, die Kohlendioxidemissionen zu reduzieren. Sie melden sich für Vermögenstransfers von der Minderheit der fortgeschrittenen Länder in die Mehrheit der armen Länder an. Und Sie können das Problem nicht einmal mit einem neuen Vertrag beheben. Wieso den? Denn bis wir eine praktische, kostengünstige Alternative zu fossilen Brennstoffen entwickelt haben, ist es unwahrscheinlich, dass erneuerbare Energien jemals mehr als 15-20 % des weltweiten Energiebedarfs decken werden. Die Menge an Energie, die der Mensch benötigt, um alles zu tun, was wir tun, ist einfach zu groß. Wenn dieser Energiebedarf wächst, muss auch die Menge an erneuerbarer Energie steigen, nur um nur einen Anteil von 15-20 % an der Gesamtmenge zu halten. Solange also die Menschen den Klimawandel nicht wirklich erleben und neue Energietechnologien entwickelt werden, werden alle Behauptungen von Politikern, wir befänden uns in einer „Klimakrise“, auf taube Ohren stoßen. Und da das größte Risiko für die Menschheit die Armut ist, wird die daraus resultierende Energiearmut, wenn wir es den politischen Entscheidungsträgern überlassen, tatsächlich den Tod einiger unserer Kinder und Enkelkinder verursachen.

e6907337	Neu-Delhi, 20. Februar (IANS) Nachdem ein Bericht des Disinfo Lab hervorhob, dass das von Greta Thunberg versehentlich fallen gelassene Toolkit einen ausländischen Experten – Pieter Friedrich – als Ressource hatte, der in Absprache mit Pakistans berüchtigter Spionageagentur Inter-Services Intelligence einen Propagandakrieg gegen Indien führte (ISI) haben Untersuchungen eines griechischen Medienunternehmens ergeben, dass die Türkei ein „integraler Bestandteil“ dieser Kampagne ist, die Pakistan hilft, Unruhen in Indien zu verbreiten. Die Untersuchung des Disinfo Lab mit dem Titel „The Unending War: From Proxy War to Info-War“, die Anfang dieser Woche veröffentlicht wurde, hat das ausgeklügelte Design aufgedeckt, an dem eine Menge zwielichtiger Unternehmen in den Vereinigten Staaten, gefälschte ausländische Experten und sogar Geisterwesen beteiligt waren, um Indiens Frieden zu beeinträchtigen , gewaltfreies Bild. Es erwähnte detailliert die Verbindungen des Masterminds, der einen Informationskrieg/Psy-Krieg gegen Indien führte, zu einem großen Terrorplan, der in den 1990er Jahren in Absprache mit dem ISI gegen Indien ausgeheckt wurde, und wie das Netzwerk, während es die Deckung von Khalistan übernahm, „noch immer da ist and connected“ arbeitet für pakistanische Interessen. Den Hinweisen aus dem Bericht des Disinfo Lab folgend, hat eine von einer führenden griechischen Nachrichten-Website durchgeführte Untersuchung die Verbindung Ankaras mit der gesamten Propaganda entschlüsselt, die gegen Indien verbreitet wird, insbesondere während der anhaltenden Bauernproteste. „Einer der prominentesten Namen, die in dem Bericht enthüllt wurden und Pieter Friedrichs Propaganda als ‚Verstärker‘ gefördert haben, ist der in Konstantinopel (Istanbul) lebende Propagandist Ali Keskin. Quellen deuten darauf hin, dass er die zentrale Figur ist, die für die Koordinierung zwischen dem pakistanischen ISI und dem türkischen Geheimdienst (MIT) im Bereich der Informationskriegsführung verantwortlich ist“, berichtete die Greek City Times. In dem Bericht heißt es, die Türkei sei ein wesentlicher Bestandteil dieser Kriegsführung gewesen und habe Pakistan bei seiner Desinformationskampagne gegen Indien unterstützt. Die griechische Veröffentlichung scannte Keskins Twitter-Handle und sagte, dass die von ihm gegen Indien, Griechenland, Frankreich, die Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate und Israel gerichteten kriegstreibenden Tweets hauptsächlich von pakistanischen Handles verbreitet wurden. „Mehrere Untersuchungen von Nachrichtenorganisationen haben ergeben, dass Ali Keskin, verärgert über die aufkommenden Beziehungen zwischen Indien und den Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten, mit Hilfe seiner Verstärker in Pakistan einen Hashtag #BoycottUAE gestartet hat, der innerhalb weniger Minuten zu einem Top-Trend-Hashtag wurde. Dies war der Vergrößerung durch radikale Pakistaner zu verdanken“, heißt es in dem Bericht. Wie die Untersuchung weiter ergab, wurde Keskin zusammen mit einem anderen türkischen Journalisten, Baba Umar, „von dem angenommen wird, dass er für den ISI arbeitet“, beauftragt, von der Türkei angegriffene Länder, insbesondere Indien, zu treffen. Das Duo hat sich regelmäßig mit den pakistanischen Propagandisten abgestimmt und die Inhalte der anderen gefördert. Auch Fredrich hat mit Umar Online-Inhalte produziert und Indien angegriffen, indem er eine pro-pakistanische Linie gegenüber Kaschmir eingeschlagen hat. „Was braucht man noch als Beweis dafür, dass Khalistani sich mit ISI-gesponserten Proxys ausrichtet? Die Verbindung zwischen Baba Umar und Pieter Friedrich deutet darauf hin, dass Pakistan begonnen hat, als Sammelpunkt zu fungieren, um alle anti-indischen Kräfte zusammenzubringen, und die Türkei ist der neue Teilnehmer in dieser Gruppe“, sagte ein Experte für kaukasische Angelegenheiten gegenüber den griechischen Medien. Der Bericht des Disinfo Lab hatte Islamabads K-2-Plan (Kaschmir-Khalistan) und die ausgefeilte Gestaltung und Planung hervorgehoben, die seit 2007 im Gange sind, angetrieben von einem einzigen Motiv – Indiens Interesse auf vier Hauptwege zu erreichen: – Ausrichtung auf die Idee Indiens – Gewaltlosigkeit & Mahatma Gandhi – Ersetzen durch ein alternatives Bild des „faschistischen Indiens“ – Angreifen der territorialen Integrität Indiens – Hinarbeiten auf ein K-2-Design – Angreifen der Interessen Indiens im Ausland durch Arbeiten gegen indischstämmige amerikanische Politiker – Beschönigen der Sünden Pakistans – Saubere Sache für Pakistan (ISI ) in Kabul Gurudwara-Bombenanschläge und Befragung des Pulwama-Anschlags Der Bericht der Greek City Times listet auch mehrere andere Propagandisten auf, darunter die in Kalifornien ansässige Zahra Billoo – eine starke Unterstützerin des Kalifat-Projekts des türkischen Präsidenten Recep Tayyip Erdogan – die als Fußsoldaten in dem von der Türkei gestarteten Informationskrieg arbeitet -Pakistan. Billoo, so der Bericht, habe in der Vergangenheit versucht, das Image der US-Politikerin Tulsi Gabbard zu verleumden, und sei derzeit damit beschäftigt, „die Anti-Indien-Botschaften zu den Bauernprotesten in Indien zu verstärken“. Ihre Tweets werden von Friedrich gemocht, wodurch der Anti-Indien-Nexus eindeutig hergestellt wird. Es ist jedoch nicht das erste Mal, dass die türkisch-pakistanische Verbindung zur Verbreitung von Terror in Indien, insbesondere in Kaschmir, aufgedeckt wurde. Die kurdische Nachrichtenagentur ANF hatte vor einigen Monaten berichtet, dass die Türkei begonnen habe, ihre Banden in Syrien darauf vorzubereiten, sie nach Kaschmir zu schicken, um für Pakistan gegen Indien zu kämpfen. Es wurde berichtet, dass Ankaras Versuch, seinen Einfluss auf Muslime in Südasien auszudehnen, Teil von Erdogans laufenden Schritten ist, Saudi-Arabiens Dominanz in der islamischen Welt herauszufordern.

053cbb15	Grönlands enormer jährlicher Eisverlust ist noch schlimmer als gedacht. Luftaufnahmen zeigen, dass zwei Gletscher im Südosten Grönlands in den Johan-Petersen-Fjord münden. Das Abschmelzen des Eisschildes würde bei einem vollständigen Verlust die Ozeane weltweit um sechs Meter ansteigen lassen. Die enormen jährlichen Eisverluste der Grönlandkappe sind laut neuen Forschungsergebnissen noch schlimmer als gedacht, die auch zeigen, dass das Schmelzen kein kurzfristiger Ausreißer, sondern ein langfristiger Trend ist. Der schmelzende grönländische Eisschild trägt bereits wesentlich zum Anstieg des Meeresspiegels bei, und wenn er schließlich vollständig verloren ginge, würden die Ozeane um sechs Meter auf der ganzen Welt ansteigen und viele der größten Städte der Welt überfluten. Die neue Studie zeigt eine genauere Schätzung des Eisverlusts, indem sie den allmählichen Anstieg der gesamten grönländischen Landmasse besser berücksichtigt. Als die Eiskappe vor 20.000 Jahren ihren Höhepunkt erreichte, drückte ihr großes Gewicht auf die heißen, zähflüssigen Felsen im darunter liegenden Mantel. Da seitdem Eis abgeworfen wurde, ist die Insel langsam nach oben zurückgeprallt. Frühere Satellitenschätzungen moderner Eisverluste versuchten, dies zu berücksichtigen, aber präzise neue GPS-Daten zeigten, dass ein Großteil Grönlands viel schneller ansteigt als gedacht, bis zu 12 mm pro Jahr. Dies bedeutet, dass jedes Jahr 19 Kubikkilometer mehr Eis ins Meer stürzen, eine Zunahme von etwa 8 % gegenüber früheren Zahlen. Die Südspitze Grönlands vom Weltraum aus gesehen. Es wird angenommen, dass die schnellere Erholung das Ergebnis heißerer, elastischerer Mantelgesteine ​​unter Ostgrönland ist, ein Überbleibsel von vor 40 Millionen Jahren, als die Insel den Hot Spot passierte, der heute Islands Vulkane antreibt. Die neue Arbeit war auch in der Lage, den Eisverlust von Grönland über Jahrtausende zu rekonstruieren und fand heraus, dass in denselben Teilen Grönlands – im Nordwesten und Südosten – sowohl in der Vergangenheit als auch heute das meiste Eis verloren ging. Das bedeutet, dass der rasante Eisverlust, der in den letzten 20 Jahren durch Satellitenmessungen aufgezeichnet wurde, wahrscheinlich kein Ausreißer ist, sondern Teil eines langfristigen Trends, der durch den Klimawandel noch verstärkt wird. Die globale Erwärmung führt zu einem starken Schmelzen auf der Oberfläche der grönländischen Gletscher und beschleunigt ihre Reise ins Meer. „Die Tatsache, dass wir eine solche Ähnlichkeit des vergangenen und gegenwärtigen Verhaltens sehen, deutet darauf hin, dass wir in diesen Regionen in Zukunft noch Jahrzehnte lang Eis verlieren könnten“, sagte Prof. Jonathan Bamber von der University of Bristol, Großbritannien, und Mitglied des internationalen Teams von Wissenschaftler, die die neue Studie durchgeführt haben, die in Science Advances veröffentlicht wurde. Bamber sagte, das Vorhandensein eines langfristigen Trends bedeute nicht, dass die globale Erwärmung kein entscheidender Faktor sei: „Wir können sicher sein, dass eine wärmere Atmosphäre und ein wärmerer Ozean diesen Trend nur beschleunigen werden.“ „Die Schlagzeilen Klimawandel und schmelzendes Polareis werden sich nicht ändern“, sagte Dr. Christopher Harig von der University of Arizona, der nicht an der Studie beteiligt war. „Die jetzt stattfindenden neuen Forschungsergebnisse sprechen wirklich für die Frage: ‚Wie schnell oder wie viel Eis kann oder wird bis zum Ende des Jahrhunderts schmelzen?‘ Je mehr wir die Komplexität der Eisschilde verstehen, desto höher sind diese Schätzungen. Meiner Meinung nach ist die Zeit der Dringlichkeit in Bezug auf den Klimawandel wirklich schon vor Jahren gekommen, und es ist höchste Zeit, dass unsere Politik diese Dringlichkeit widerspiegelt.“ Dr. Pippa Whitehouse von der University of Durham, die ebenfalls nicht an der neuen Forschung beteiligt war, sagte: „Diese Studie unterstreicht die aussagekräftigen Erkenntnisse, die GPS-Messungen über vergangene und gegenwärtige Eisverluste liefern können. Anhand solcher Messungen zeigt diese Studie, dass einige der höchsten Eisverlustraten in ganz Grönland – sowohl in der Vergangenheit als auch heute – in Gebieten zu finden sind, in denen die Eisdecke direkt in den Ozean fließt, was es in beiden Fällen gefährlich anfällig für eine zukünftige Erwärmung macht die Atmosphäre und das Meer.“ Schmelzwasser auf der Oberfläche des grönländischen Eisschildes 10. Juni 2014 und 15. Juni 2016. Jeden Frühling oder Frühsommer verwandelt sich die Oberfläche des Schildes von einer riesigen weißen Landschaft aus Schnee und Eis in eine mit blauen Schmelzwasserbächen, Flüssen, und Seen. 2016 begann der Übergang früh und schnell. Das Team hinter der neuen Forschung sagte, dass bessere Schätzungen der kontinentalen Rückprallraten bei Schätzungen des Eisverlusts von der größten Eiskappe der Welt in der Antarktis noch signifikanter sein könnten, aber diese spärlichen Daten von dem abgelegenen Kontinent erschwerten die Analyse. Im April führten sehr hohe Temperaturen in Grönland zu einem rekordverdächtig frühen Schmelzbeginn der Gletscher, während eine weitere Satellitenstudie im August den raschen Eisverlust bestätigte.

16751630	"Kaltwasserkorallen sollten widerstandsfähiger sein Alle Meereslebewesen werden davon betroffen sein, weil die Kohlendioxidemissionen der modernen Gesellschaft die Ozeane saurer machen, heißt es in einem wichtigen neuen Bericht. Die achtjährige Studie von mehr als 250 Wissenschaftlern stellt fest, dass Meeresbewohner besonders geschädigt werden. Dies bedeutet, dass die Zahl der Kabeljaubabys, die bis zum Erwachsenenalter heranwachsen, auf ein Viertel oder sogar ein Zwölftel der heutigen Zahl sinken könnte, vermuten die Forscher. Die Einschätzung stammt aus dem von Deutschland aus geleiteten Projekt BIOACID. Eine Broschüre, die die wichtigsten Ergebnisse zusammenfasst, wird den Klimaunterhändlern auf ihrem Jahrestreffen präsentiert, das dieses Jahr im November in Bonn stattfindet. Die Autoren des Berichts über die biologischen Auswirkungen der Ozeanversauerung sagen, dass einige Lebewesen direkt von den chemischen Veränderungen profitieren könnten – aber selbst diese könnten immer noch indirekt durch Verschiebungen im gesamten Nahrungsnetz beeinträchtigt werden. Darüber hinaus zeigen die Untersuchungen, dass Veränderungen durch Versauerung durch Klimawandel, Umweltverschmutzung, Küstenentwicklung, Überfischung und landwirtschaftliche Düngemittel noch verschlimmert werden. Die Ozeanversauerung findet statt, weil sich CO2 aus fossilen Brennstoffen im Meerwasser auflöst, es Kohlensäure produziert und dies den pH-Wert des Wassers senkt. Reagenzgläser Mesokosmen (""riesige Reagenzgläser"") ermöglichen es Wissenschaftlern, die Auswirkungen der Versauerung auf lebende Organismen zu untersuchen. Seit Beginn der industriellen Revolution ist der durchschnittliche pH-Wert der globalen Ozeanoberflächen von pH 8,2 auf 8,1 gefallen. Dies entspricht einer Erhöhung des Säuregehalts um etwa 26 %. Erstautor der Studie ist Prof. Ulf Riebesell vom GEOMAR Helmholtz-Zentrum für Ozeanforschung in Kiel. Er ist eine weltweite Autorität auf diesem Gebiet und hat sich normalerweise vorsichtig über die Auswirkungen der Versauerung geäußert. Er sagte gegenüber BBC News: „Die Versauerung beeinflusst das Meeresleben in allen Gruppen, wenn auch in unterschiedlichem Maße. „Warmwasserkorallen sind im Allgemeinen empfindlicher als Kaltwasserkorallen. Muscheln und Schnecken sind empfindlicher als Krebstiere. „Und wir haben festgestellt, dass frühe Lebensstadien im Allgemeinen stärker betroffen sind als erwachsene Organismen.“ Aber selbst wenn ein Organismus nicht direkt durch Versauerung geschädigt wird, kann er indirekt durch Veränderungen in seinem Lebensraum oder Veränderungen im Nahrungsnetz beeinträchtigt werden. „Am Ende des Tages werden sich diese Veränderungen auf die vielen Dienste auswirken, die der Ozean für uns erbringt.“ Auf der Agenda Seit 2009 untersuchen Wissenschaftler im Rahmen des BIOACID-Programms, wie Meereslebewesen in verschiedenen Lebensphasen von der Versauerung betroffen sind; wie diese Reaktionen im marinen Nahrungsnetz widerhallen; und ob die Herausforderungen durch evolutionäre Anpassung gemildert werden können. Einige Untersuchungen wurden im Labor durchgeführt, andere Studien wurden in der Nordsee, der Ostsee, der Arktis und Papua-Neuguinea durchgeführt. Eine Zusammenfassung von mehr als 350 Veröffentlichungen zu den Auswirkungen der Ozeanversauerung, die den Klimadelegierten auf dem Gipfel im nächsten Monat übergeben wird, zeigt, dass fast die Hälfte der getesteten Meerestierarten negativ auf den bereits moderaten Anstieg der CO2-Konzentration im Meerwasser reagierte. Frühe Lebensstadien waren bei Kabeljau, Miesmuscheln, Seesternen, Seeigeln und Meeresschmetterlingen betroffen. Aber ein Experiment mit Seepocken zeigte, dass sie nicht säuerungsempfindlich waren. Und einige Pflanzen – wie Algen, die Kohlenstoff für die Photosynthese nutzen – könnten sogar davon profitieren. Meereskieselalgen Organismen, die Kalziumkarbonat zum Aufbau ihres Körpers verwenden, werden wahrscheinlich Probleme haben Dr. Carol Turley, eine Expertin für Ozeanversauerung von Plymouth Marine Labs in Großbritannien, beschrieb die BIOACID-Forschung als enorm wichtig. Sie sagte gegenüber BBC News: „Es hat enorme Einblicke in die Auswirkungen beigetragen, die die Versauerung auf eine Vielzahl von Meeresorganismen von Mikroben bis zu Fischen haben kann und die menschliche Gesellschaft beeinflussen. „Im Vorfeld der UN-Klimaverhandlungen in Bonn im November dieses Jahres ist klar, dass der Ozean und seine Ökosysteme nicht außer Acht gelassen werden sollten.“ Die Konferenz findet in Deutschland statt, wird aber von Fidschi geleitet, das möchte, dass die Delegierten den Auswirkungen von CO2 auf die Ozeane gebührende Aufmerksamkeit schenken."

ee916575	"Barack Obama wandert mit Mitarbeitern des National Park Service zum Exit Glacier im Kenai Fjords National Park in Seward, Alaska. Präsident Obama ist letzte Woche mit Fotografen im Schlepptau zum Exit-Gletscher in Alaska gewandert, um der Welt eine Botschaft zu übermitteln: Der Gletscher schmilzt.
Obama macht dafür die zunehmende Nutzung fossiler Brennstoffe wie Kohle, Öl und Erdgas verantwortlich, die er nicht nur in den USA, sondern weltweit einschränken will. Der Fototermin wurde entwickelt, um Unterstützung für ein internationales Klimaabkommen aufzubauen, auf dessen Verkauf er hart drängt, bisher mit wenig Erfolg. Das Problem ist, dass der Präsident seine Fakten klarstellen muss. Exit Glacier schrumpft seit 200 Jahren – seit 1815 – lange vor der weit verbreiteten Industrialisierung und den Automobilen. Als der Präsident seine Reise beendete, schlug er erneut Alarm: „Das Klima dieses Staates ändert sich vor unseren Augen.“ Kurzmeldung, Herr Präsident: Alaska wird seit Tausenden von Jahren von zyklischen Klimaschwankungen heimgesucht. Das gilt auch für den Rest der Welt. Es gab eine 300 Jahre lange mittelalterliche Hitzewelle, gefolgt von einer kleinen Eiszeit, die um 1300 begann, und dann der 300-jährigen Erwärmungsperiode, in der wir uns jetzt befinden. Die Anchorage Daily Times veröffentlichte 1922 eine Titelgeschichte, in der sie die „unerhörten Temperaturen“ in der Arktis und das Verschwinden von Gletschern aufzeichnete. „Der Arktische Ozean erwärmt sich und Eisberge werden immer seltener.“ Obama war sich der Geschichte des ständigen Klimawandels nicht bewusst, wies auf Exit Glacier und sagte: „Wir wollen sicherstellen, dass unsere Enkelkinder dies sehen können.“ Er mag seinen Wunsch bekommen, aber es wird nicht wegen irgendetwas sein, was er tut. Der aktuelle Erwärmungstrend scheint vorbei zu sein, spekuliert Roger Cohen, ein Mitglied der American Physical Society. Das Alaska Climate Research Center meldet fast keine Hinweise auf Erwärmungstrends in Alaska seit 1977. Viele Wissenschaftler sagen den Beginn von zwei oder drei Jahrhunderten kühleren Wetters voraus – was größere Gletscher bedeuten würde. Und das trotz der weltweit wachsenden Nutzung fossiler Brennstoffe. Egal was Menschen tun, Temperaturtrends gehen nach oben und dann nach unten; Gletscher dehnen sich aus und ziehen sich dann zurück; Der Meeresspiegel steigt und fällt dann, erklärt Will Happer, emeritierter Physikprofessor in Princeton. Das bedeutet nicht, dass Umweltschutzmaßnahmen sinnlos sind. Wir alle wollen saubere Luft atmen. Aber geben Sie den Menschen nicht die Schuld für den Klimawandel. Hier sind größere Kräfte am Werk. Wissenschaftler sind sich uneins darüber, was diese Kräfte sind, und erforschen bessere Möglichkeiten, um Temperaturtrends per Satellit genau zu messen. Inmitten all dieser Kontroversen und Ungewissheit über den globalen Klimawandel besteht Obama blind darauf, dass seine Theorie der globalen Erwärmung „unbestreitbar ist“, und greift seine Kritiker als „Leugner“ an. Obama klang eher wie ein Schwarzseher aus dem Alten Testament als wie ein Präsident und warnte in seiner Alaska-Rede, dass „wir unsere Kinder auf einen Planeten verdammen werden, der ihre Fähigkeit zur Reparatur übersteigt: versunkene Länder. Verlassene Städte. Felder wachsen nicht mehr.“ Klingt beängstigend, aber er bewegt sich auf dünnem Eis, um diese Vorhersagen zu untermauern. Trotz Obamas erklärter Sorge um die vom Klimawandel betroffenen Menschen in Alaska ging es bei seinem Besuch mehr um Theater als um Hilfe für die Einheimischen. Alaskas republikanische Senatorin Lisa Murkowski kritisierte Obamas arbeitsplatzvernichtende neue Beschränkungen für Öl- und Gasbohrungen in der Arktis. Obama sagt, die Region sei „sehr fragil“, aber Murkowski ist besorgter, dass die Wirtschaft fragil ist. „Es ist klar, dass sich diese Regierung nicht um uns kümmert und uns nur als Territorium betrachtet“, sagte sie.

Es ist eine Demonstration von Obamas entsetzlichem Mangel an Prioritäten. Der Präsident sagte seinem Publikum in Alaska, dass „wenige Dinge unser Leben so tiefgreifend stören werden wie der Klimawandel“. Wirklich, Herr Präsident? Wie wäre es mit der Epidemie von Schießereien auf Polizisten in den Vereinigten Staaten oder den ertrunkenen Kleinkindern, die an der Mittelmeerküste angespült werden, wenn Familien aus dem Nahen Osten fliehen, oder dem IS, der Tausende von Christen enthauptet?

Obama sagt, dass es beim Klimawandel mehr als bei jedem anderen Thema „so etwas wie ein Zuspätkommen gibt“. Erzählen Sie das der Witwe eines Polizisten oder dem Vater, der mit ansehen musste, wie seine Familie ertrank."	Wach auf, Obama, der Klimawandel findet schon ewig statt	partially false
d0b0e459	Wissenschaftler kennen seit langem das anomale „Erwärmungsloch“ im Nordatlantik, einem Gebiet, das gegen die Erwärmung der Ozeane der Erde immun ist. Diese kühle Zone im Nordatlantik scheint mit einer Verlangsamung der Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) verbunden zu sein, einer der wichtigsten Triebkräfte der globalen Ozeanzirkulation. Eine kürzlich in Nature veröffentlichte Studie beschreibt die Forschung eines Teams von Wissenschaftlern der Yale University und der University of Southhampton. Das Team fand Beweise dafür, dass der arktische Eisverlust das größte Ozeanzirkulationssystem des Planeten möglicherweise negativ beeinflusst. Während Wissenschaftler einige Analogien dazu haben, wie sich dies auf die Welt auswirken könnte, werden wir uns weitgehend auf unbekanntem Gebiet befinden. AMOC ist eines der größten Strömungssysteme im Atlantik und der Welt. Im Allgemeinen transportiert es warmes und salziges Wasser aus den Tropen nach Norden in den Süden und Osten Grönlands. Dieses warme Wasser kühlt auf Umgebungswassertemperatur ab und sinkt dann ab, da es salziger und damit dichter ist als das relativ frischere Umgebungswasser. Die dichte Wassermasse sinkt auf den Grund des Nordatlantiks und wird entlang des Abgrunds des Atlantiks nach Süden gedrückt. Schema der atlantischen meridionalen Umwälzzirkulation Dieser Prozess, bei dem Wasser in den Nordatlantik transportiert wird, dient dazu, das Meerwasser global zu verteilen. Was noch wichtiger ist und viele Wissenschaftler beunruhigt, ist, dass dieser Mechanismus einer der effizientesten Wege ist, wie die Erde Wärme von den Tropen in die nördlichen Breiten transportiert. Das aus den Tropen in den Nordatlantik transportierte warme Wasser gibt Wärme an die Atmosphäre ab und spielt eine Schlüsselrolle bei der Erwärmung Westeuropas. Sie haben wahrscheinlich schon von einer der beliebtesten Komponenten der AMOC gehört, dem Golfstrom, der warmes tropisches Wasser an die Westküsten Europas bringt. Es mehren sich die Hinweise darauf, dass die vergleichsweise kalte Zone im Nordatlantik auf eine Verlangsamung dieser globalen Ozeanwasserzirkulation zurückzuführen sein könnte. Daher eine Verlangsamung der Fähigkeit des Planeten, Wärme von den Tropen in die nördlichen Breiten zu übertragen. Die kalte Zone könnte auf das Schmelzen von Eis in der Arktis und Grönland zurückzuführen sein. Dies würde zu einer kalten Süßwasserkappe über dem Nordatlantik führen und das Absinken salzhaltiger tropischer Gewässer verhindern. Dies würde die globale Zirkulation verlangsamen und den Transport von warmen tropischen Gewässern nach Norden behindern. Gemessener Trend der Temperaturschwankungen von 1900 bis 2012. Das Abschmelzen des arktischen Meereises hat in den letzten Jahrzehnten rapide zugenommen. Aufzeichnungen von Satellitenbildern zeigen, dass das arktische Meereis im September heute um 30 % weniger ist als 1979. Dieser Trend des verstärkten Schmelzens des Meereises während der Sommermonate scheint sich nicht zu verlangsamen. Daher deuten die Anzeichen darauf hin, dass wir eine anhaltende Schwächung des globalen Ozeanzirkulationssystems sehen werden. Dieses Szenario eines Zusammenbruchs der AMOC und der globalen Ozeanzirkulation ist die Prämisse für den Film „The Day After Tomorrow“. Als Haftungsausschluss ist die Handlung, in der ein Großteil von Neuengland und Westeuropa in eine Eiszeit gestürzt wird, deutlich übertrieben und nach menschlichen Zeitmaßstäben unrealistisch. Während Geologen Ereignisse in der Vergangenheit untersucht haben, die denen ähneln, die heute zu geschehen scheinen, sind sich die Wissenschaftler weitgehend unsicher, was vor uns liegt.

af8069e0	"(CNN) Grönlands Eisschild ist bis zu einem Punkt geschmolzen, an dem es kein Zurück mehr gibt, und Bemühungen zur Verlangsamung der globalen Erwärmung werden es nicht davon abhalten, sich aufzulösen. Das geht aus einer neuen Studie von Forschern der Ohio State University hervor. „Die Eisdecke befindet sich jetzt in diesem neuen dynamischen Zustand, in dem wir, selbst wenn wir zu einem Klima zurückkehren würden, das eher dem von vor 20 oder 30 Jahren entspricht, immer noch ziemlich schnell an Masse verlieren würden“, sagte Ian Howat, Co-Autor der Studie und ein Professor an der Ohio State University, sagte. Laut Michalea King, der Hauptautorin der Studie und Forscherin an der Ohio State University, schüttet Grönlands Eisschild jedes Jahr mehr als 280 Milliarden Tonnen schmelzendes Eis in den Ozean und ist damit der größte Einzelverursacher des globalen Meeresspiegelanstiegs. Der Eisverlust sei in den letzten Jahren so massiv gewesen, sagte sie, dass er eine messbare Veränderung des Gravitationsfeldes über Grönland verursacht habe. ILULISSAT, GRÖNLAND - In dieser Luftaufnahme bildet schmelzendes Eis einen See auf frei schwebendem Eis, das bei ungewöhnlich warmem Wetter am 30. Juli 2019 in der Nähe von Ilulissat, Grönland, im Ilulissat-Eisfjord eingeklemmt ist. Das Schmelzen des Eises in Grönland trägt jedes Jahr zu einem Anstieg des Meeresspiegels um mehr als einen Millimeter bei, und das wird wahrscheinlich noch schlimmer. Der Meeresspiegel wird voraussichtlich bis zum Ende des Jahrhunderts um mehr als 3 Fuß ansteigen und Strände und Küstengrundstücke wegwischen. Küstenstaaten wie Florida und tief liegende Inselstaaten sind besonders gefährdet. Nur 3 Fuß Meeresspiegelanstieg könnten große Küstenabschnitte unter Wasser setzen. Vierzig Prozent der US-Bevölkerung leben in Küstengebieten, die vom Anstieg des Meeresspiegels bedroht sind. „Es gibt viele Orte, insbesondere in Florida, wo ein Meter allein eine Menge bestehender Landflächen bedecken würde“, sagte King. „Und das wird noch verschärft, wenn Stürme und Hurrikane und ähnliches auftreten, die dann zusätzlich zu einer höheren Grundlinie einen zusätzlichen Anstieg verursachen.“ Die Studie ergab auch, dass sich die Eisdecke in schnellen Ausbrüchen zurückzieht, was zu einem plötzlichen und unvorhersehbaren Anstieg des Meeresspiegels führt, was es schwierig macht, sich auf die Auswirkungen vorzubereiten. Die Studie verwendete Satellitendaten aus vier Jahrzehnten, um Veränderungen in Grönlands Eisschild zu messen. Die Autoren stellten fest, dass die Eisdecke nach dem Jahr 2000 so schnell geschrumpft ist, dass der erneute Schneefall nicht mit der Schmelzrate von Teilen des Gletschers Schritt halten würde, die neu dem wärmeren Meerwasser ausgesetzt waren, selbst wenn der Klimawandel rückgängig gemacht würde. Ganze Eisküsten ziehen sich aufgrund des Klimawandels auf einmal zurück, sagte Howat und fügte hinzu, dass alle 200 Gletscher, aus denen die grönländische Eisdecke besteht, beobachtet wurden, wie sie sich innerhalb derselben Episode zurückzogen. Obwohl der Rückgang des grönländischen Eisschildes wahrscheinlich nicht rückgängig gemacht werden kann, ist dies nur der erste einer Reihe von Wendepunkten. Wenn der Klimawandel in diesem Tempo weitergeht, wird die Schmelzrate noch viel schlimmer. „Wir haben den Punkt ohne Wiederkehr überschritten, aber es kommt offensichtlich noch mehr“, sagte Howat. „Anstatt ein einzelner Wendepunkt zu sein, an dem wir von einer glücklichen Eisdecke zu einer schnell zusammenbrechenden Eisdecke übergegangen sind, ist es eher eine Treppe, bei der wir von der ersten Stufe gefallen sind, aber es gibt noch viele weitere Stufen, die hinuntergehen müssen Grube."""

c360c876	Übertriebene Worst-Case-Behauptungen führen zu einer schlechten Politik und ignorieren eine Fülle ermutigender Daten. Es ist eine unbestreitbare Tatsache, dass die CO2-Emissionen steigen – und zwar schneller, als die meisten Wissenschaftler vorhergesagt haben. Aber viele Klimawandel-Alarmisten scheinen zu behaupten, dass jeder Klimawandel schlimmer ist als erwartet. Dabei wird ignoriert, dass viele der Daten tatsächlich ermutigend sind. Die neueste Studie des Zwischenstaatlichen Ausschusses der Vereinten Nationen für Klimaänderungen ergab, dass die Temperaturen in den vergangenen 15 Jahren um 0,09 Grad Fahrenheit gestiegen waren. Der Durchschnitt aller Modelle erwartet 0,8 Grad. Wir sehen also etwa 90 % weniger Temperaturanstieg als erwartet. Fakten wie diese sind wichtig, denn eine einseitige Konzentration auf Worst-Case-Storys ist eine schlechte Grundlage für eine solide Politik. Ja, das arktische Meereis schmilzt schneller als von den Modellen erwartet. Aber Modelle sagten auch voraus, dass das Meereis in der Antarktis abnehmen würde, aber es nimmt zu. Ja, der Meeresspiegel steigt, aber der Anstieg beschleunigt sich nicht – wenn überhaupt, zwei aktuelle Arbeiten, eine von chinesischen Wissenschaftlern, veröffentlicht in der Januarausgabe 2014 von Global and Planetary Change, und die andere von US-Wissenschaftlern, veröffentlicht in der Maiausgabe 2013 von Coastal Engineering, haben einen leichten Rückgang der Anstiegsrate des Meeresspiegels gezeigt. Uns wird oft gesagt, dass wir immer mehr Dürren sehen, aber eine im März letzten Jahres in der Zeitschrift Nature veröffentlichte Studie zeigt tatsächlich eine Abnahme der Erdoberfläche, die seit 1982 von Dürren heimgesucht wurde. Hurrikane werden ebenfalls als Beispiel dafür herangezogen die „immer schlimmer“-Trope. Wenn wir uns die USA ansehen, wo wir die besten Statistiken haben, steigen die Schadenskosten durch Hurrikane – aber nur, weil mehr Menschen mit teurerem Eigentum in Küstennähe leben. Bereinigt um Bevölkerungszahl und Wohlstand sind die Hurrikanschäden im Zeitraum 1900-2013 leicht zurückgegangen. Auf der UN-Klimakonferenz in Lima, Peru, im Dezember wurde den Teilnehmern gesagt, dass ihre Länder die CO2-Emissionen reduzieren sollten, um künftige Schäden durch Stürme wie den Taifun Hagupit zu vermeiden, der während der Konferenz die Philippinen traf, mindestens 21 Menschen tötete und mehr als 21 Menschen in den Tod zwang eine Million in Notunterkünfte. Laut einer 2012 vom Journal of Climate der American Meteorological Society veröffentlichten Studie ist der Trend zu auf die Philippinen treffenden Taifune seit 1950 tatsächlich zurückgegangen. Wieder wird uns gesagt, dass die Dinge schlimmer sind als je zuvor, aber die Fakten stützen dies nicht.	Das Alarmierende am Klimaalarmismus	partially false
13aaf021	Ein Schneesturm! Das heißeste Jahr aller Zeiten! Weitere Anzeichen dafür, dass die globale Erwärmung und ihre extremen Auswirkungen außer Frage stehen, oder? Nichtmal annähernd. Ein heulender Schneesturm an der Ostküste, weltweite Höchsttemperaturen, Überschwemmungen im Südwesten der Wüste, das von Dürre heimgesuchte Kalifornien trocknet aus – sicherlich gibt es einen roten Faden, der dieses „extreme“ Wetter zusammenhält. Es gibt. Aber es hat wenig mit dem zu tun, was die jüngsten Schlagzeilen über das heißeste Jahr aller Zeiten sagten. Es heißt business as usual. Die Oberflächentemperaturen steigen in der Tat leicht an: Sie steigen seit mehr als 150 Jahren oder seit einer erbärmlich kalten und pestartigen Periode, die als Kleine Eiszeit bekannt ist, stoßweise an. Bevor Kohlendioxid aus der Wirtschaftstätigkeit uns hätte erwärmen können, stiegen die Temperaturen zwischen 1910 und dem Zweiten Weltkrieg um drei Viertel Grad Fahrenheit. Dann kühlten sie etwas ab, nur um sich von Mitte der 1970er bis Ende der 90er Jahre wieder zu erwärmen, etwa so stark wie zu Beginn des Jahrhunderts. Ob sich die Temperaturen seitdem stark erwärmt haben, hängt davon ab, was man betrachtet. Bis letzten Juni räumten die meisten Wissenschaftler ein, dass die Erwärmung Ende der 1990er Jahre ihren Höhepunkt erreichte und seitdem in einer „Pause“ ein Plateau erreicht hatte. Dafür gibt es in der referierten Literatur etwa 60 verschiedene Erklärungen. Das änderte sich letzten Sommer, als die National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) beschloss, ihre Daten zu überarbeiten, die von Satelliten gemessenen Meeresoberflächentemperaturen seit den späten 1970er Jahren zu verwerfen und sich stattdessen unter anderem auf Messwerte aus dem Kühlwasser zu verlassen -Einlassrohre von Seeschiffen. Die wissenschaftliche Literatur ist voll von Artikeln über die großen Messfehler, die in diesen Daten entstehen, weil die Infrastruktur eines Schiffes Wärme leitet, eine enorme Menge Sonnenenergie absorbiert und die Ansaugrohre der Schiffe in unterschiedlichen Meerestiefen liegen. Siehe zum Beispiel John J. Kennedys „A Review of Uncertainty in In-situ Measurements and Data Sets of Sea Surface Temperature“, veröffentlicht am 24. Januar 2014 in der Zeitschrift Reviews of Geophysics. Die Änderung ihres Messstandards durch die NOAA und andere Änderungen führten zu einem Ergebnis, das hätte vorhergesagt werden können: ein geringfügig signifikanter Erwärmungstrend in den Daten der letzten Jahre, der das Temperaturplateau auslöschte, das verärgerte Klimaalarmisten nur schwer erklären konnten. Der Anstieg bleibt jedoch weit hinter den Erwartungen zurück.	Der Klima-Schnee-Job	partially false
3d1a155a	Dagegen können wir nichts tun, außer Deiche und Deiche etwas höher zu bauen. Eisspalten nahe der Küste der Westantarktis. Von allen bekannten und vermuteten Folgen des Klimawandels fürchten viele Menschen den Anstieg des Meeresspiegels am meisten. Aber die Bemühungen, herauszufinden, was den Meeresspiegel verursacht, werden durch schlechte Daten und Meinungsverschiedenheiten über die Methodik getrübt. Der bekannte Ozeanograph Walter Munk bezeichnete den Anstieg des Meeresspiegels als „Rätsel“; es wurde auch ein Rätsel und ein Puzzle genannt. Es wird allgemein angenommen, dass der Anstieg des Meeresspiegels hauptsächlich durch die thermische Ausdehnung des Meerwassers, die sogenannte sterische Komponente, beschleunigt wird. Aber durch die Untersuchung eines sehr kurzen Zeitintervalls ist es möglich, die meisten Komplikationen zu umgehen, wie die „isostatische Anpassung“ der Küstenlinie (wenn Kontinente steigen, nachdem das darüber liegende Eis geschmolzen ist) und das „Absinken“ der Küstenlinie (als Grundwasser und Mineralien werden abgebaut). Ich habe mich entschieden, den Meeresspiegeltrend von 1915 bis 1945 zu bewerten, als eine echte, unabhängig bestätigte Erwärmung von etwa 0,5 Grad Celsius stattfand. Ich stelle besonders fest, dass der Anstieg des Meeresspiegels nicht von der Erwärmung betroffen ist; Laut einer Übersicht von Andrew S. Trupin und John Wahr aus dem Jahr 1990 geht es mit der gleichen Rate weiter, 1,8 Millimeter pro Jahr. Ich schließe daher – entgegen der allgemeinen Meinung –, dass die Temperatur des Meerwassers keinen direkten Einfluss auf den Anstieg des Meeresspiegels hat. Das bedeutet auch nicht der atmosphärische Gehalt an Kohlendioxid. Diese Schlussfolgerung ist hervorzuheben: Sie zeigt, dass der Anstieg des Meeresspiegels nicht von der Nutzung fossiler Brennstoffe abhängt. Die Beweise sollten die Befürchtung zerstreuen, dass die Freisetzung von zusätzlichem CO2 den Anstieg des Meeresspiegels verstärken wird. Aber es gibt auch gute Daten, die zeigen, dass der Meeresspiegel tatsächlich konstant ansteigt. Der Trend wurde von einem Netzwerk von Gezeitenpegeln gemessen, von denen viele seit über einem Jahrhundert Daten sammeln.	Das Meer steigt, aber nicht wegen des Klimawandels	partially false
6c425155	Erhöhtes atmosphärisches Kohlendioxid hat dazu beigetragen, die globale Nahrungsmittelproduktion zu steigern und die Armut zu verringern. Nationale Umfragen zeigen, dass der Klimawandel ganz unten auf der Prioritätenliste der Wähler steht. Aus gutem Grund: In den USA und in weiten Teilen der Welt wurden die gefährlichsten Umweltschadstoffe beseitigt. Die US-Emissionen von Partikeln, Metallen und verschiedenen Gasen – alle diese: Ozon, Blei, Kohlenmonoxid, Stickoxide und Schwefel – sind zwischen 1970 und 2014 um fast 70 % gesunken. Weitere Reduzierungen werden durch verbesserte Technologien wie die katalytische Entfernung von Oxiden erzielt Stickstoff- und effizientere Schwefelwäscher. Dies ist ein Segen für die menschliche Gesundheit. Aber es hält sich ein Mythos, der sowohl unwissenschaftlich als auch unmoralisch aufrechtzuerhalten ist: dass das nützliche Gas Kohlendioxid zu den gefährlichen Schadstoffen zählt. Es tut nicht. Im Gegensatz zu echten Schadstoffen ist Kohlendioxid (CO2) ein geruchloses, farbloses Gas. Jeder Mensch atmet täglich etwa zwei Pfund CO2 aus, zusammen mit einer ähnlichen Menge Wasserdampf. CO2 ist für Menschen und Tiere ungiftig und ein lebenswichtiger Nährstoff für Pflanzen. Es ist auch ein Treibhausgas, das dazu beiträgt, die Erde auf einer bewohnbaren Temperatur zu halten. Die Angst vor einer übermäßigen Erwärmung durch mehr CO2 in der Atmosphäre, einschließlich des durch menschliche Aktivitäten freigesetzten, hat einige Menschen veranlasst, sich für eine erhebliche und teure Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen einzusetzen. Aber Beobachtungen, wie die auf unserer Website der CO2 Coalition, zeigen, dass ein erhöhter CO2-Gehalt im nächsten Jahrhundert eine bescheidene und nützliche Erwärmung verursachen wird – vielleicht bis zu einem Grad Celsius (1,8 Grad Fahrenheit) – und dass dies ein noch größerer Vorteil sein wird zur Landwirtschaft als jetzt. Die Kosten für Emissionsregulierungen, die von allen getragen werden, werden strafend hoch sein und den meisten Menschen auf der ganzen Welt keinen Nutzen bringen.

8060b507	Selbst wenn die Welttemperaturen steigen, ist die angemessene Reaktion der Politik noch immer eine offene Frage. Ein Deich und eine Windmühle in Rotterdam, einer Stadt, die bereits von Überschwemmungen betroffen ist. Der Klimawandel wird oft als Pauschalangebot missverstanden: Wenn die Erderwärmung „real“ ist, scheinen beide Seiten der Debatte anzunehmen, folgt die politische Agenda der Klimalobby unaufhaltsam. Es tut nicht. Die Befürworter der Klimapolitik müssen die wirtschaftlichen Kosten und die tatsächlichen statt symbolischen Vorteile ihrer Politik viel besser quantitativ analysieren. Skeptiker täten auch gut daran, der Wirtschafts- und Politikanalyse mehr Aufmerksamkeit zu widmen. Um zu einer klugen politischen Antwort zu gelangen, müssen wir zunächst überlegen, wie viel wirtschaftlichen Schaden der Klimawandel anrichten wird. Aktuelle Modelle kämpfen darum, wirtschaftliche Kosten zu erzielen, die der apokalyptischen politischen Rhetorik entsprechen. Typische Kosten liegen deutlich unter 10 % des Bruttoinlandsprodukts im Jahr 2100 und darüber hinaus. Das ist viel Geld – aber auch viele Jahre. Selbst 10 % weniger BIP in 100 Jahren entsprechen 0,1 Prozentpunkt weniger jährlichem BIP-Wachstum. Der Klimawandel rechtfertigt daher keine Politik, die mehr als 0,1 Prozentpunkte Wachstum kostet. Wenn das Ziel 10 % mehr BIP in 100 Jahren ist, wären wachstumsfördernde Steuer-, Regulierungs- und Anspruchsreformen weitaus effektiver. Ja, die Kosten sind nicht gleichmäßig verteilt. Einige Orte werden besser abschneiden, andere schlechter. Der amerikanische Süden könnte ein schlechterer Ort für den Weizenanbau sein; Südkanada könnte besser sein. In einem Jahrhundert könnte sich Miami in ungefähr der gleichen Situation befinden wie die niederländische Stadt Rotterdam heute.	Der Klimawandel ist nicht das Ende der Welt	partially false

1a46b040	Heule, schlage deinen Kopf gegen die Wand, reiße dir die Haare und verzweifle an diesem Land. Wie kann es sein, dass fast die Hälfte der Bevölkerung glaubt, dass die Menschen aufgrund der Pandemie ihren Arbeitsplatz verloren haben, weil sie ihre eigene Leistungsschwäche hatten? Nur 31 % führen es auf Pech zurück. Schauen Sie sich in jeder Stadt und jedem Ort um, um die geschlossenen Geschäfte, geschlossenen Büros, vernagelten Kneipen, Bars und Restaurants zu sehen, die offensichtlichen Zeichen des Massenverlusts von Arbeitsplätzen. Wieder einmal sind die Linken gezwungen, einige düstere Realitäten über die Haltung der britischen Öffentlichkeit zu konfrontieren. Die gründliche Forschung des King’s College London darüber, wie Menschen über Ungleichheit denken, reicht aus, um die politische Hoffnung so gut wie auszulöschen. Es ist schön zu wissen, dass Labour-Anhänger freundlicher sind als ihre Tory-Kollegen, aber trotzdem glauben schockierende 39 % der Labour-Wähler, dass es die eigene Schuld der Menschen ist, dass sie ihren Arbeitsplatz verloren haben, da die Arbeitslosenquote diese Woche 5 % erreichte, und es wird noch schlimmer kommen. Warum schockiert uns das immer wieder, da das britische Volk am häufigsten in konservativen Regierungen gewählt hat, wobei Labour immer wieder niedergeschlagen wurde? Das Brexit-Votum war der schwerste Hammerschlag seit Menschengedenken, gefolgt von Boris Johnsons Triumph. Diese Untersuchung zeigt, dass es außergewöhnlich kluger Überzeugungsarbeit bedarf, um die Öffentlichkeit mit einem ausreichend starken Willen zu begeistern, Ungleichheit deutlich zu reduzieren. „Es gibt keinen weit verbreiteten Appetit auf Veränderung“, schließt der letzte Abschnitt dieses niederschmetternden Berichts. Was für ein Schlag für uns alle, die hoffen, dass diese Krise ein Moment von 1945 sein könnte, dass die massive Intervention des Staates zum Überleben so vieler Menschen den Appetit auf mehr geweckt haben könnte. „Trotz der durch die Pandemie verursachten wirtschaftlichen Schwierigkeiten sollten wir keine weit verbreitete Neubewertung der Argumente für größere staatliche Eingriffe in die Wirtschaft erwarten“, lautet das ernüchternde Fazit. Der Hauptautor, Professor Bobby Duffy, langjähriger Ipsos-Mori-Forscher zu sozialen Einstellungen, erinnerte mich daran, dass sich die Einstellungen zu Rasse, Geschlecht und Sexualität historisch zum Besseren gewendet haben und dass jüngere Menschen erheblich fortschrittlicher sind als diejenigen, die es sind alt. Aber als ich mit ihm sprach, warnte er davor, dass sich die Einstellungen wieder ändern können: „Das heißt nicht, dass es keine Rückfälle geben wird.“ Er warnte in Bezug auf die Rasse, dass feste 13% giftige rassistische Einstellungen haben. Ein Viertel der Menschen denkt, dass es kein Problem wäre, wenn Covid einen Anstieg der ethnischen Ungleichheit verursacht, obwohl 67 % sagen, dass dies der Fall wäre. Die Ungleichheit zwischen den Geschlechtern hat einen geringen Stellenwert, möglicherweise weil sich eine ältere Generation daran erinnert, wie sehr sich das bereits verbessert hat. Hier ist die große politische Kluft, die interessanterweise in Brexit-bezogene Linien fällt: Zwei Drittel der Labour-Verbliebenen glauben, dass die Krise mehr staatliche Intervention rechtfertigt, verglichen mit nur einem von fünf konservativen Austritten. Die Pandemie hat die Ansichten trotz all des Applaus für Pflegekräfte und Schlüsselkräfte kaum verändert. Während 82 % der Labour-Verbliebenen glaubten, Großbritannien sei vor dem Ausbruch des Coronavirus ungleich, wird diese Ansicht von nur 53 % der konservativen Abgänger geteilt. Was soll jetzt dagegen getan werden? Das hängt davon ab, wie die Frage formuliert ist: Verwenden Sie das Wort „Umverteilung“ und die Unterstützung für Maßnahmen beträgt nur 48 %, aber formulieren Sie es als „die Regierung sollte Maßnahmen ergreifen, um die Einkommensunterschiede zu verringern“, und die Unterstützung steigt auf 62 %. Besteuern Sie diejenigen, die sehr reich sind, und Unternehmen, aber nicht sich selbst, so lautet ungefähr die Übersetzung, wie in vielen anderen Umfragen. Die einzige Frage der Benachteiligung, bei der sich die meisten einig sind, ist die Ungleichheit des Platzes. Etwa 61 % stimmen zu, dass Ungleichheiten zwischen mehr und weniger benachteiligten Gebieten am schwerwiegendsten sind. Paul Johnson, Leiter des IFS, für den diese Forschung Teil seines Deaton Review of Inequalities ist, findet dies verblüffend. Er rätselt darüber, ob die Leute Norden und Süden meinen, sagen wir Burnley versus Twickenham, oder meinen sie, so hofft er, überall die Kluft zwischen armen und reichen Bezirken? London zum Beispiel mag unter den City-Bankern einen grotesken Reichtum haben, aber es hat auch die größte Armut, und er sagt, es sei bei weitem am stärksten von der durch die Pandemie verursachten Arbeitslosigkeit betroffen. Durchschnittswerte täuschen trügerisch. „Nehmen Sie die tatsächliche Kluft zwischen Absolventen und Nicht-Absolventen“, sagt Johnson. „Nach Zählung der Wohnkosten hat ein Absolvent in Burnley das gleiche Einkommen wie einer in Twickenham, aber viel mehr Absolventen, die in Twickenham leben, geben ihm einen hohen Durchschnitt.“ Kann diese einfache Tatsache erklärt werden, damit die Menschen erkennen, dass es nicht nur um große Projekte im Norden geht, sondern um die Anhebung niedriger Einkommen überall? Diese Ergebnisse werden die Herzen der Konservativen höher schlagen lassen, Labour jedoch vor schmerzhafte Dilemmata stellen. Die Bekämpfung der Ungleichheit ist das große Anliegen von Labour, aber das mag bei zu vielen Wählern ein abstoßendes Wort sein. Paul Johnson erinnert sich: „Tony Blair hat Ungleichheit nie erwähnt, aber mit Steuergutschriften mehr als jede andere Regierung zur Linderung der Armut beigetragen.“ Blair sprach stattdessen von „sozialer Ausgrenzung“. Diejenigen, die Keir Starmer für seine Vorsicht kritisieren, sollten diesen Bericht gründlich studieren. Am deprimierendsten ist, wie viele Menschen Erfolg und Misserfolg nur auf harte Arbeit und Ehrgeiz zurückführen: Die Menschen glauben, dass dies eine Meritokratie ist, kein System, das von Geburt und Glück bestimmt wird. Prof. Duffy sprach darüber, wie seit den 1970er Jahren die individuelle Schuld die systemische Ungerechtigkeit als Erklärung der Menschen für Ungleichheit ersetzt hat. Großbritannien war 1975 am ausgeglichensten, aber mit der Explosion des Thatcherismus, der die Spitzeneinkommen aufhob und die unteren Einkommen zurückfielen, kam eine Dosis amerikanisierten Individualismus. Mehr als die Hälfte der Belegschaft gehörte in den 1970er Jahren einer Gewerkschaft an, und sie dienten nicht nur der Macht, sondern auch der politischen Bildung. Jetzt sind nur noch 23 % Mitglieder und der politische Einfluss der Gewerkschaften im öffentlichen Diskurs ist schwach. An die Stelle des Kollektivs tritt ein verzerrtes Verdienstverständnis, das von der Rechten verbreitet wird und bewusst die sozialen Ungerechtigkeiten ignoriert, die die Zukunft von Geburt an prädestinieren. Da wir in Hoffnung leben und dennoch am Realismus festhalten müssen, legt diese Studie nahe, dass der beste Weg, Wähler mit Ungleichheit zu beschäftigen, die Lokalität und der Ort sind. Aber flüstere das Wort.	Es ist herzlos, Arbeitslose für den Verlust von Arbeitsplätzen verantwortlich zu machen – aber so denkt Großbritannien	partially false
c1e124d5	"Menschen mit Lungenkrebs sterben, nachdem sie spät in der Notaufnahme diagnostiziert wurden, weil ihr Hausarzt trotz oft wiederholter Besuche Anzeichen der Krankheit übersehen hat, haben Experten enthüllt. Laut einem Bericht der UK Lung Cancer Coalition werden in einigen Teilen Englands bis zu 56 % der Menschen, die an Lungenkrebs erkranken, erst diagnostiziert, wenn sie die Notaufnahme aufsuchen. Es ist fünfmal wahrscheinlicher, dass sie innerhalb eines Jahres sterben als diejenigen, deren Zustand entweder von ihrem Hausarzt oder durch das NHS-Krebsvorsorgeprogramm festgestellt wurde. Hausärzte diagnostizieren Fälle von Lungenkrebs oft erst, wenn es zu spät für eine wirksame Behandlung ist, oder übersehen sie ganz, was dazu führt, dass Patienten Hilfe bei der Notaufnahme suchen, heißt es in dem Bericht. Mehr als ein Drittel der Lungenkrebspatienten suchen ihren Hausarzt dreimal oder öfter auf, bevor sie zu Untersuchungen überwiesen werden. Dies ist ein Schlüsselfaktor für die im internationalen Vergleich schlechte Bilanz des Vereinigten Königreichs bei der Früherkennung der Krankheit. Lungenkrebs ist die dritthäufigste Krebsart im Vereinigten Königreich und der größte Krebskiller, der jährlich 35.000 Todesopfer fordert. „Menschen, die in der Notaufnahme diagnostiziert wurden, sterben aufgrund von Verzögerungen bei der Identifizierung ihrer Krankheit. Eine späte Diagnose erschwert die Behandlung von Lungenkrebs und ist ein Hauptgrund dafür, dass wir in Großbritannien ein so schlechtes Überleben haben“, sagte Prof. Mick Peake, Vorsitzender der klinischen Beratungsgruppe der Koalition. Es sei „eine Farce“, dass die Krankenhauseinweisung als medizinischer Notfall die häufigste Art der Diagnose der Krankheit sei, fügte Peake hinzu, der auch klinischer Direktor des Centre for Cancer Outcomes am University College Hospital London ist. Das Versäumnis der Hausärzte, Symptome von Lungenkrebs zu erkennen, sei nur ein Grund für Großbritanniens geringe Früherkennungsrate und hohe Sterblichkeitsrate bei Lungenkrebs, betonte Peake. Er fügte jedoch hinzu: „Es gibt gute Beweise dafür, dass Gelegenheiten für eine frühere Diagnose in der Grundversorgung verpasst werden, und wir fordern die Allgemeinmediziner dringend auf, bei Patienten mit Verdacht auf eine Lunge eine niedrige Schwelle für die Durchführung einer Röntgenaufnahme des Brustkorbs oder eines CT-Scans zu haben Krebs."" Die Zurückhaltung der Patienten, Symptome wie anhaltenden Husten untersuchen zu lassen, kann die Diagnose ebenfalls verzögern, insbesondere bei Patienten aus ärmeren Haushalten und älteren Menschen. Von Peake zitierte NHS-Daten zeigen eine Postleitzahlenlotterie, bei der Tower Hamlets im Osten Londons den höchsten Anteil an Patienten hat, deren Krankheit in A & E diagnostiziert wird – 56,2 % – dicht gefolgt von Manchester 56,1 % und Leeds Süd und Ost 54 %. Mehr als 50 % der Patienten werden auch in der Notaufnahme in Salford, Hull, South Tyneside und Sunderland diagnostiziert. Im Gegensatz dazu werden nur 14,7 % der Patienten in Guildford und Waverley in Surrey auf diese Weise diagnostiziert, mit niedrigen Raten auch in Wokingham in Berkshire mit 15,7 % und Harrogate mit 16 %. Dr. Moira Fraser-Pearce, Direktorin für Politik, Kampagnen und Einfluss bei Macmillan Cancer Support, sagte, dass Personalmangel in den NHS-Krebsdiensten und eine hohe Arbeitsbelastung die komplexen Gründe für das hohe Diagnoseniveau in der Notaufnahme verschärfen. Macmillan hat dem NHS England dabei geholfen, eine neue Methode zum Screening von Rauchern und anderen Hochrisikopatienten auf Lungenkrebs zu entwickeln, indem Tests in Lastwagen angeboten werden, die oft auf Parkplätzen von Supermärkten stehen. Der NHS äußerte sich nicht direkt zu den Ergebnissen, aber ein Sprecher sagte: „Der NHS fängt mehr Krebserkrankungen früher auf, wenn sie leichter zu behandeln sind, was zu Rekord-Überlebensraten bei Lungenkrebs führt.“ Gezielte Lungengesundheitschecks an Orten wie Supermarktparkplätzen werden „Tausende mehr Fälle von Krebs entdecken, die sonst möglicherweise nicht entdeckt worden wären, und noch mehr Leben retten“, fügten sie hinzu. NHS England hat sich verpflichtet, bis 2028 drei von vier Krebsfällen in einem frühen Stadium zu diagnostizieren. Derzeit werden 57 % der Lungenkrebserkrankungen spät diagnostiziert, was die Überlebenschancen stark verringert."

8209ca7b	Der durchschnittliche verurteilte Kriminelle, der eine kurze Haftstrafe verbüßt, hat zuvor mehr als 55 Straftaten begangen, wie Zahlen der Polizei zeigen. Einige Wiederholungstäter werden den Daten zufolge zum ersten Mal ins Gefängnis geschickt, nachdem sie 100 oder mehr verschiedene Verbrechen begangen haben. Die Zahlen, die diesen Monat von den Ministern herausgerutscht sind, deuten darauf hin, dass die meisten Kriminellen, die ins Gefängnis kommen, in der Vergangenheit bereits wegen mehrerer Straftaten verurteilt wurden. Der i-Politik-Newsletter hat den Lärm durchbrochen E-Mail-Adresse ist ungültig Vielen Dank für Ihre Anmeldung! Entschuldigung, es gab ein Problem mit Ihrem Abonnement. Konservative Abgeordnete behaupteten, die Enthüllung beweise, dass das Justizsystem zu weich gegenüber Straftätern sei, während Reformer der Regierung vorwarfen, Kriminelle nicht zu rehabilitieren und sich zu sehr auf Gefängnisse zu verlassen. Geschichte der Straftaten Als Antwort auf eine schriftliche Frage des Tory-Hinterbänklers Philip Davies sagte das Justizministerium, dass der durchschnittliche Mann, der zu einer Gefängnisstrafe von weniger als sechs Monaten verurteilt wurde, 56,6 Straftaten begangen habe, die zu einer Verurteilung oder Verwarnung geführt hätten, während Frauen in derselben Position dies getan hätten 60.4 Vorstrafen. Die Zahlen zeigten auch, dass es im vergangenen Jahr einen Täter gab, der 93 verschiedene Verbrechen begangen hatte, bevor er zum ersten Mal ins Gefängnis kam. 2018 waren mindestens zwei Erstgefangene zuvor wegen mehr als 100 Straftaten verurteilt worden. Die Daten stammen vom Police National Computer, der alle Polizeikräfte im Vereinigten Königreich abdeckt. Herr Davies, der Abgeordnete von Shipley, sagte gegenüber i: „Diese Zahlen zerstören absolut die liberal-linke Orthodoxie des Strafjustizsystems. Bevor Menschen zu einer kurzen Haftstrafe verurteilt werden, erhalten sie eine Gemeinschaftsstrafe nach der anderen, und dies ist ein Beweis dafür, dass Gemeinschaftsstrafen nicht funktionieren.“ Die Abgeordnete der Liberaldemokraten, Layla Moran, argumentierte jedoch, dass die Daten „ein systemisches Versagen aufdecken, diejenigen zu rehabilitieren, die wegen Verbrechen verurteilt wurden, und eine erneute Straftat zu verhindern“. Sie fügte hinzu: „Es ist zutiefst heuchlerisch von der Regierung, hart über Kriminalität zu sprechen und auf Polizeizahlen zu pochen, während sie gleichzeitig nicht in Rehabilitations- und Präventionsinitiativen investiert.“ Andrew Neilson von der Howard League for Penal Reform fügte hinzu: „Menschen für kurze Zeit ins Gefängnis zu schicken, ist besonders ineffektiv, wie diese Zahlen zeigen. Die meisten Menschen, die kurze Haftstrafen verbüßen, haben dies schon einmal getan und werden dies mit ziemlicher Sicherheit wieder tun. Es funktioniert einfach nicht.“ Der Justizminister reagierte nicht auf eine Bitte um Stellungnahme.

e2abfbe6	Die Labour Party hat der Regierung vorgeworfen, Patienten im Stich gelassen zu haben, nachdem die Bundeskanzlerin eine Kürzung der täglichen Ausgaben im Ministerium für Gesundheit und Soziales um 30 Milliarden Pfund begraben hatte, da die Wartelisten ein Rekordhoch erreichten. Der Vorsitzende der Labour Party, Keir Starmer, wird heute Morgen am Donnerstag ein Krankenhaus in Derby besuchen, da Haushaltsdokumente eine geplante Kürzung der täglichen Ausgaben im Ministerium für Gesundheit und Soziales um 30,1 Milliarden Pfund ab April dieses Jahres enthüllten. Eine neue, von der Labour Party veröffentlichte Analyse zeigt Folgendes: Die Zahl der Patienten, die länger als 18 Wochen auf eine Behandlung warten, ist in den letzten zehn Jahren um über 500 % gestiegen. Fast eine Viertelmillion Menschen warten mehr als ein Jahr auf eine Behandlung. Derzeit stehen schätzungsweise 4,59 Millionen Menschen auf der Warteliste für eine Behandlung – die höchste jemals verzeichnete Zahl. Schon vor dem Ausbruch der Pandemie war die Zahl der Personen, die länger als 18 Wochen warteten, in den letzten neun Jahren auf über 720.000 im Dezember 2019 gestiegen. Nur 68 % der Patienten auf der Warteliste haben 18 Wochen oder weniger gewartet – das gesetzliche Ziel dass 92 % der Patienten innerhalb von 18 Wochen nach der Überweisung eine Behandlung erhalten müssen, wurde seit 2016 nicht erreicht. Die Zahlen beinhalten Patienten, die auf Hüft- und Kniegelenkersatz und Kataraktentfernung warten, neben vielen anderen Eingriffen und Behandlungen, die für die Lebensqualität der Menschen von entscheidender Bedeutung sind. Die Ausgaben des NHS England werden von 147,7 Mrd. £ in diesem Jahr auf 139,1 Mrd. £ im nächsten Jahr sinken, trotz der laufenden Kosten für den NHS durch Covid und des enormen Rückstands an Fällen und Wartelisten, die sich während der Krise aufgebaut haben. Im November schätzte die Health Foundation, dass die Beseitigung der Rückstände und die Reduzierung der Wartezeiten in den nächsten drei Jahren rund 2 Milliarden Pfund pro Jahr kosten würden. Jonathan Ashworth MP, Shadow Health and Social Care Secretary, kommentierte die Ergebnisse wie folgt: „Die Bundeskanzlerin lässt Patienten, unseren NHS und seine Mitarbeiter im Stich, indem sie während einer Pandemie die Dienstleistungen an vorderster Front einschränkt. „Da die Listen bereits auf einem Rekordhoch sind, bedeutet dies, dass Patienten mit Schmerzen noch länger auf eine lebenswichtige Behandlung warten müssen. „Der gestrige Haushalt hat die Risse zugekleistert, anstatt die Grundlagen unseres Landes wieder aufzubauen.“	Bundeskanzler lässt Patienten mit seiner Kürzung des NHS um 30 Milliarden Pfund im Stich, da die Wartelisten ein Rekordhoch erreichten	false

Die Taskforce hat die psychiatrische Versorgung überprüft und ihre Vision für eine vorbeugende, ganzheitliche psychiatrische Versorgung dargelegt und dafür gesorgt, dass Menschen, die in einer Krise sind, immer eine Versorgung zur Verfügung steht. Zu den bis 2021 zu liefernden Empfehlungen gehören: ein Ende der Praxis, Menschen aus ihrem Wohngebiet zur stationären Akutversorgung zu schicken, die Bereitstellung psychischer Gesundheitsversorgung für weitere 70.000 Kinder und Jugendliche, die Unterstützung von 30.000 weiteren neuen und werdenden Müttern durch Dienste für psychische Gesundheit für Mütter neu Finanzierung, um sicherzustellen, dass alle Akutkrankenhäuser psychiatrische Dienste in Notaufnahmen für Menschen jeden Alters haben Verbesserung des Zugangs zu Gesprächstherapien, um 25 % derjenigen zu erreichen, die diese Unterstützung benötigen Verpflichtung zur Reduzierung von Selbstmorden um 10 % Antwort auf den Bericht, Gesundheitsminister Jeremy Hunt sagte: Wir haben in diesem Land enorme Fortschritte bei der Behandlung von Geisteskrankheiten gemacht – aber wir müssen noch weiter gehen. Unsere gemeinsame Vision eines 7-tägigen psychiatrischen Dienstes bedeutet, dass Menschen die Versorgung erhalten, die sie benötigen, wenn sie sie benötigen, und dass sie dazu beitragen, psychische Erkrankungen von vornherein zu verhindern. Einer von vier Menschen wird ein psychisches Gesundheitsproblem haben, und die Kosten psychischer Erkrankungen für die Wirtschaft, den NHS und die Gesellschaft insgesamt belaufen sich auf 105 Milliarden Pfund pro Jahr. Diese Ankündigung wird die bereits erzielten Fortschritte beschleunigen, einschließlich: Erhöhung der Mittel, die seit 2010 jedes Jahr in die psychische Gesundheit gesteckt werden, was dem NHS im vergangenen Jahr eine Rekordsumme von 11,7 Milliarden Pfund einbrachte, Einführung der allerersten Zugangs- und Wartezeitstandards für psychische Gesundheit, d.h Menschen erhalten die Pflege, die sie brauchen, wenn sie sie brauchen, indem sie 1,4 Milliarden Pfund investieren, um die psychiatrischen Dienste für junge Menschen umzugestalten Alistair Burt, Minister für psychische Gesundheit, sagte:	Neue Investitionen in psychiatrische Dienste	other

Mehr als einer von zehn Anrufern bei HMRC erreicht niemanden, verglichen mit etwas mehr als einem von 20 vor einem Jahr, was Kritik von Abgeordneten hervorruft, dass der Dienst Millionen von Selbstständigen im Stich lässt. Das wahre Ausmaß des Problems ist sogar noch schlimmer, als die HMRC zuzugeben bereit ist, da ihre Prüfung Steuerzahler ignoriert, die einen engagierten Ton hören, wenn sie die Hotline für Steuerberatung anrufen. Die eigenen Zahlen von HMRC zeigen auch, dass die Beantwortung von 14 Prozent der Anrufe mehr als 10 Minuten dauerte, obwohl dies nicht die Zeit einschließt, die die Leute mit der Navigation durch den automatisierten Anrufbearbeitungsdienst verbringen, was die Länge eines Anrufs um weitere vier Minuten verlängern kann. Im September, dem Monat vor Ablauf der Frist für die Steuererklärung in Papierform, dauerte die Beantwortung eines von fünf Anrufen länger als 10 Minuten. Es kommt trotz der Behauptungen der HMRC, dass sie ihre Leistung nach früherer Kritik an ihrem telefonischen Steuerberatungsdienst verbessert hat.

Aber am Freitag stellte sich heraus, dass ein Fehler im System bedeutet, dass ein staatlicher „Bonus“ von 25 Prozent auf Ersparnisse nicht ausgezahlt wird, bis der Verkauf abgeschlossen ist. Experten sagen, dass dies das Programm technisch nutzlos macht, da es für diejenigen konzipiert ist, die Schwierigkeiten haben, die anfänglichen Ausgaben für den Kauf eines Eigenheims aufzubringen, und bedeutet, dass sie weiterhin auf Kredite ihrer Eltern angewiesen sind, falls verfügbar.
