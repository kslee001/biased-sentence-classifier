"Women have to work much harder to make it in this world. It really pisses me off that women dont get the same opportunities as men do, or money for that matter. Because lets face it, money gives men the power to run the show. It gives men the power to define our values and to define whats sexy and whats feminine, and thats bullshit. At the end of the day, its not about equal rights, its about how we think. We have to reshape our own perception of how we view ourselves. - Beyonce",1,2

"Whenever my daughter and I talk about marriage, I always make sure we talk about the fact that boys can marry boys and girls can marry girls. She loves to act out the bride walking down the aisle with a veil and flowers. But this quote is right.... it shouldnt be seen as an achievement for women (and not necessarily for men).

"'chef Heston Blumenthal has claimed that female chefs arent reaching the same career heights in the industry as men because of evolution, their biological clocks and the difficulty of lifting heavy pots and pans after childbirth.' Sexists comments about female chefs are popping up regularly in the news. I feel frustrated about them but I move on by venting to my husband. This time Id like to vent here as I worked for HB between 2011-2013. Working for was one of my most influential experiences. I was part of the team when The Hind's Head won the Michelin . I worked every section in that kitchen including grill and sauce. I did 1month stage at The core team treated me as if Id be stupid, used all the stagiers as cleaners and showed no respect towards them. I also worked a couple of days at Dinner by HB. The head pastry chef offered me a job after a dinner service; I was able to run the tipsy cake section without any training as their CDP was in the sh.t for the whole time. I moved on to work somewhere else and a few years later (2016) I had a baby. I worked in the kitchen until 32 weeks and returned to work when my son was 10 month old. I was doing mostly night shifts so he didn't have to spend the whole day at daycare. I slept 4 hours for 2 years. I ruined myself both physically and mentally. This made me realise theres something wrong with the industry. Theres no support towards working mothers if it comes to chef jobs. When I read statements like above it breaks my heart, it hurts my feelings, I feel frustrated and angry. I also feel a huge amount of courage to speak up and stand up against this kind of douchebags. There would be more female chefs if the hours would be reasonable, the pay would be fair, there would be respect towards the employees, and if the employer could provide stability and flexibility. Giving a working a mother the next week's rota on Saturday night is simply not good enough. Dear Heston, let me tell you something; its easier to lift 'heavy pots and pans' than a 3 year old child because the pots don't wriggle and kick and talk back while you doing it.",1,1

"Oh, beautiful girl, that boy who called you a cow never even left your hometown. You hated your body and starved it almost to death. Then, someone made you hate it because you told them it wasnt theirs to touch (which was ironic given you never thought anyone would want to touch you at all).

The difference between these two photos isnt the size of my waist; its my happiness.

"POLICING WOMENS BODIES // From telling women their clothing doesnt cover up enough skin to telling women people wont respect them if they dont dress a certain way From telling women when to have children to telling them how many children to have From telling women how much makeup is appropriate to telling them how tight/loose their clothing should be if they dont want to be perceived to be without morals From telling women theyre too thin and so they need to eat more to telling women they need to go on a diet if they ever want to be desirable enough to get married the desi community feels the right to police womens bodies and what they put on it, without hesitation. The bodies of women/daughters/sisters/wives are commented on and policed without shame by family members and community members alike. What is considered appropriate / comfortable is rarely left to the woman to decide for herself.

"In February 1970, Kathleen Cleaver, communication secretary of the Black Panther Party (BPP), was asked by a reporter from the womens page of the Washington Post what she thought was a womans role in the revolution. She responded, in No one ever asks what a mans place in the Revolution is.1 To many, the BPP conjures up a hypermasculine image of Black men in leather coats and berets carrying shotguns. Yet at its heightaccording to a survey conducted by Chairman Bobby Seale in 1969the party membership was over 60 percent female.2 These women were integral to every aspect of party life, including serving as prominent leaders. Yet until recently, much of their work has been sidelined in historical research and popular media. Recent scholarship is shedding light on the role of women in the BPP and the Black struggle more broadly. For activists involved in todays strugglesfrom women who have been at the forefront of the Black Lives Matter movement, to the widespread impact and identification with (which among other things has prompted a reckoning with sexism within activist spaces), to the popular use of the term intersectionality to make sense of the interlocking forces of racial, class, and gendered oppressionthe experience of women in the BPP offers a host of lessons. The BPP emerged in an era of global mass revolt. In the United States, the struggle against anti-Black racism was the central flashpoint that opened up a mass radicalization around a whole host of issuesfrom war and imperialism, to womens and LGBT oppression, to class inequality and capitalism. By the end of the 1960s, millions of young Americans believed a revolution was necessary in this country and thousands flooded into revolutionary groups like the BPP. The BPPs Ten Point Program outlined a vision for liberation, encompassing demands for jobs, housing, education, and self-determination. In its early phase, the partys activity focused on point the fight against police brutality. Making use of their Constitutional rights, the Panthers boldly asserted their intention to use arms to defend the Black community from police violence.",1,1

Community resources that support survivors of sexual violence and domestic abuse, like trauma-informed yoga programs, can be life-saving. Not only is yoga well-known to have therapeutic benefits due to its ability to engage the parasympathetic nervous system, but yoga classes taught by trauma-informed instructors also represent safe spaces where survivors have the opportunity to rest and heal.

"Domestic violence is violent behavior or other forms of abuse (will be elaborated further) by one person against another in a domestic setting. This can be in cases of marriage or cohabitation. According to the Journal of Pakistan Medical Association, approximately 70 to 90% of Pakistani women are subjected to domestic violence - which is absolutely alarming and makes it more common than we may think. For protection against and curtailment of domestic violence, we must first understand what it encompasses. 1. Physical this is the first thing peoples mind goes to when they think of domestic violence. Physical abuse may contain but is not limited hitting, kicking, scratching, threatening with a weapon, threatening to injure others (children, pets, special property), refusal of provision of necessities (food, water etc), forcible physical restraint, and destruction of property. 2. Sexual coercion or guilt-tripping the victim for their desire not to engage in sexual intercourse, exploiting a victim who is unable to make an uninformed decision (while they are asleep, or intoxicated), making any nonconsensual sexual contact, constant accusations of infidelity, having affairs to taunt the victim, and withholding sex as a control mechanism.

"Must read 1st then share on story. For spreading this wrds Follow & Slut - A word used by boys to describe a girl's character these days. She wears short clothes, she is a slut! She is going for a late night party, she is a slut! She is talking with more than one guy, she is a slut! She is not a virgin, she is a slut! She is having more male friends, she is a slut! And now a days, even if a girl is wearing an off shoulder top, you guys label her as a slut! She is not a slut...Come on every one is having freedom to live.. Rather I should say that your minds are filled with dirt. Everytime when a girl decides to live her life in her own way, she is labelled as a slut by some knuckleheads. STOP THIS SLUT SHAMING. Do you guys ever realise how bad a girl feels, when she is called a Slut? Just because she wanted to live her life freely? Life seems meaningless to her. She regrets being born as a girl. .I want you to know that you are beautiful no matter what others say to you. No one deserves to feel even for a second that they are worthless in this world. Never give anyone the ability to bring you down or allow you to think you are not good enough. Each and every one of us were placed on this Earth with a purpose...No one can heal themselves by wounding others. Our words must be used to encourage others, not destroy them. We do not know the struggles and hardships others may be experiencing. It is important to always be mindful of the feelings of others. Do not be afraid to be yourself because that is what makes you special. You can achieve anything you set your mind to. This is your life, it is up to you to paint it the way you would like it to be  So Dear Girls, Don't hold back your feelings and awesomeness just because of some cheap and mentally disturbed craps...Don't just walk away, just give them a tight slap give that person a nice lesson, lets your hands do the talking and at last just ask a question...Ghar meh maa behan nai hai kya ?",0,0

"A great depiction of what panic can feel like from . Panic is no joke! The feeling of panic can show up when we get triggered or have a memory of the sexual assault. And, it can be so intense that we may feel like were about to die because its hard to breathe. Although we may not be able to control the onset of the feeling, we can control it. Here are a few actions that may help to better manage the symptoms of panic 1. Start grounding - Plant your feet flat on the ground and push down with the balls and heels. This resistance can help pull your mound out of the feelings/thoughts that are causing the panic and bring you into present moment. 2. Open your eyes and look at your surroundings 3. Touch a (non dangerous) solid object that is near to you.",0,0

"If you cant convince yourself, you cant convince others Theres a lot of talk about confidence, but for a good its one of the most fundamentally significant concepts for women in the workplace. If you do not (at least) appear to have confidence in what you say, do, suggest or recommend, why should anyone else? Our 2019 survey results found that whilst 81.1% of women felt that always or mostly demonstrated external confidence, only 47% matched this with strong internal confidence. Whilst its brilliant that women are resilient enough to present a confident faade, some of their potential will undoubtably be lost due to this lack of self-belief. To change things we have to address the cause, not the symptoms. These internal confidence issues are caused by external biases which eclipse the truth about individual womens capability potential. By using psychological insights, we want to expose these limiting beliefs and enable all women to unlock their full potential. Is your internal confidence holding you back? . . .",0,0

"Ive recently come to fully accept another part of my infinite my freakiness/sexuality. I honestly always had the freak streak in me and sometimes showed it but I found myself occasionally being ashamed of being public with it due to fear of others judgment. Friends, family members and strangers would question me or place judgment on things that werent really their business to begin with. (Go find my poem, my body is not your body.) With guys it always kills me because many of our fave artists are very sexual; Im sure Ferg aint the only one who want to eat Rih-rih like a panini, yet yall will slut-shame a girl you know from done the street if she expresses herself as a savage. Either way, as someone who experienced sexual trauma and had to personally deal with the guilt and pain that comes with it YEARS after, I realize now that I dont need to give two shits anymore lol. If Im a freak, a hoe, or a tease because I like to proudly show this temporary temple off then fuck it. Bite me  That being said I usually gladly share this side of myself with the person Im with. Although Im not with anyone this was written for one person in particular . I may or may not share with him lol ...but what you think?

"OOPS!... I DID IT A FAN! NOT A FAN? NOT A PROBLEM For a long time, I wasnt either. Truth is, in this world where everybody loves to hate and status and succes seem to be all that matter, it is hard to love yourself. It took me a while, a LONG while, but somehow I managed to learn. To see the good in me. The ENOUGH in me. To believe I deserved better. Because I did and I do. We all do. Thus, how unimaginable this once was, here I am posting these photos of ME, being my goofy self, without feeling ashamed or disgusted. Of course I HOPE YOU LIKE ME and think I am hilarious. But If you dont, thats OK. I am not everyones taste and I dont have to be, because today at least I am my own taste. I like me. And hopefully in doing so, I am inspiring others to be so bold, so brave to love themselves In Focus on the love, not the hate. Be kind to yourself and to others. The world truly is a beautiful place and there is enough room for all of us to shine together. AMEN",0,0

"SEXUAL ASSAULT/HARASSMENT/RAPE I was 15 when I had a boy who we will call Carl over at my house. Him and I were best friends, and he was always very kind to me. I had to help him with homework, and we wanted to try my new Xbox game. While we were downstairs, we made a bet that if he won the first round he would get whatever he wanted, and vise verse. He said he wanted tacos and I said I would want a soda. He won, and I told him Id buy tacos. He said he didnt want tacos, but instead, he wanted to be friends with benefits. I said no, but he persisted. He began touching my thighs and telling how guys loved me because I was super flexible and had a nice ass. He began grabbing my ass and he would grab me and hold me down as he was grinding on me. He wouldnt stop no matter how many times I said no. He stuck his hands down my pants even when I fought him off... he put his hands up my shirt and held me down so I couldnt do anything. He tried pulling off my pants, and was sneaking peaks at my underwear. He forced me to kiss him, and I couldnt pull away for he was holding onto my neck. He took my hand and forced me to touch his crouch outside of his jeans. He said nasty things to me... and I kept pleading him to stop. He was my age, and he goes to my school. He told me not to tell anyone and later texted me, sorry for forcing myself onto you. I cant even look at him without wanting to vomit. He was trying to rape me, but I managed to get him off. I ended up telling my mother, and broke down on the spot. He makes me so sick...and I feel like its my fault because I should have seen the red flags.",1,2

"karlyletomms.com - Although not everyone has been sexually violated, most of us know what it is like to be touched in a way that we don't like or by someone we did not want to touch us. I am one of those people who has been sexually violated, and when I was younger, I can say that I was not as respectful of the boundaries of others as I should have been. I am also one of those people who doesn't mind most physical contact. Outside of the times that I was sexually violated or have had my butt pinched, I can think of only one time that anyone touched me when it really bothered me and that was very innocent. A guy told me ""thank you"" for something I had done for him and put his hand briefly between my shoulders. I don't know why it bothered me, but it felt like the devil had run through my body. Had he kept his hand there, I probably would have asked him to stop, and he probably would have respected that. Being able to ask for your boundaries to be respected, and having them respected is an extremely important thing. One of the things the movement is bringing to the forefront of discussion is the importance of having one's boundaries honored and respected. No matter who someone is, no matter how much authority or influence they may have, they have no right to touch you in a way that you are not willing to allow. The only exception might be an effort to subdue someone who is resisting arrest, being violent or in process of violating someone. This whole discussion about physical boundaries is one that society needs to continue. It is about time it was brought out of the shadows and into the open light of scrutiny. Our bodies are the one possession within our absolute domain. Our comfort or lack of comfort with being touched is our own business and whatever boundaries we set need to be respected. Even those who violate others would not want certain touch from certian people. The Golden Rule can therefore be applied in reverse. Do not do to others what you would not want done to you.",0,0

"(1/3) - I know that I will miss out on many of the fine experiences that are a source of joy for my colleagues because I am defined by my gender and I hate that fact. Tears in her eyes burned with anger. She realized that although she was carrying a heavy backpack and creating new routes on virgin walls in a women's team, in the eyes of many men on the way to the base camp she appeared only as a sexual object. Nothing better. She also knew that when farmers come back at night with a few bottles of vodka and their hands wander in the wrong directions, only the word spoken by the man could stop them. The womans voice was hitting the wall, becoming silence. . Before I asked, I knew the answer. There is no equality in Armenia. According to a report by Amnesty International, every fourth girl born in a country of endless mountains will become a victim of physical violence, and her colleagues will be even more exposed to psychological violence. However, we cannot see these images. We cover them with walls of houses and a curtain of tradition that teaches - A woman is like wool; the harder you hit her, the more delicate she will be. Generations of women whose mothers and grandmothers, locked up in harem and raped on a mass scale, have somehow escaped death during the Armenian Genocide, seem to be largely accustomed to this patriarchal order. They have been broken in spirit for centuries. . // .mcg & (belayer) during the first attempt on their fresh & super challenging route! . .mcg .peter .france .world",1,2

"EXCITING ANNOUNCEMENT Laura Bates is back again with her new book, MEN WHO HATE WOMEN. For over a year has immersed herself in a terrifying and shocking world of violence and hatred that is actively and directly causing mass murders of women. In this ground-breaking investigation, Laura traces the roots of extreme misogyny across a complex network of online groups extending from Men's Rights Activists and Pick up Artists to Men Going their Own Way, Trolls and the Incel movement, in the name of which some men have committed terrorist acts. Seeing boys and men groomed and radicalised to adopt an extreme and misogynistic mindset, Laura has spent months drawing parallels with other extremist movements around the world, seeking to understand what attracts men and boys to the movement, how it operates and considers what can be done. Most urgently of all, Laura traces the pathways this extreme ideology has taken from the darkest corners of the internet to emerge covertly in our mainstream media, our playgrounds and even our parliament.

"On this day in 1973, the Battle of the Sexes occurs. The battle was between 29 year old and number 1 ranked womens tennis player Billie Jean King against former number 1 mens tennis player, 55 year old Bobby Riggs. King took the challenge after Riggs stated that women could not handle the pressure of the game and that even at his age he can beat any female tennis player. The match had massive appeal as 30,000 people witnessed the match live and over 50 million people watched it on TV. King went on to win in 3 sets and helped legitimize female athletes.

"Earlier this year I was privileged to speak about how really connecting with people was my number one focus for 2019 and beyond. So often, its easy to meet with friends, family and work colleagues and pass pleasantries. We British love to greet with  How are you? But not intend an answer other than fine thanks! I find this tradition can lead to conversation devoid of meaning, as often the opportunity to connect deeply is lost with the first exchange. What if with each interaction we intend a deep connection that can enhance our belonging and filter out any feeling of isolation? And what if we can be inspired, learn, help others, or just laugh out loud through these deep connections. Ive just finished reading Melinda Gates book The Moment Of Lift In her closing paragraphs she talks about connection being more important than equality. And I have to agree, however, in order to understand Melindas point fully, read the book, it is one of the most important books Ive read in recent times. If youd like to attend a event where people come together devoid of labels, so that deep connection can be made through the stories told, then Scroll through to see the date for their next event partnering with one of my favourite brands Some of my best connections have been down to the excellent work and team do.  . . +Male",0,0

"A woman being labelled a slut is the equivalent of a man been labelled a loser. It's a simple way of placing a stigma on someone so as to disqualify them from being a viable sexual mate or long term partner to anyone of the opposite sex. ""Slut shaming"" is now illegal. & Even protests & ""slut walks"" are held to remove this stigma entirely. Does this mean sluts no longer exist? Does this mean all women should be offorded equal evaluation by men as a sexual mate or long term partner? I'm not really interested in that. What I want to know is if it's all in the name of equality, where's the law on labeling a guy a loser? Where are the ""loser walks"" & protests? Where are the activists to preach to women that they should give every guy an equal opportunity for some pussy regardless of his social &/financial status? Sound ridiculous? Damn right it does! Because is fucking is! If a woman can freely destroy a man's financial status & his social status without legal ramifications, a bitch can be slut shamed!

A study conducted by WHO in 2018 placed India at the top of the list of the most depressed countries of the world, a position which we shouldnt be proud to hold. In todays fast moving world, it is imperative to eradicate the taboo that prevails around mental health and sensitise people about the harms of neglecting it.

"Is it possible to reclaim the word slut, or is it too tainted to become empowering? Leora Tanenbaums I Am Not a Slut-Shaming In The Age of The Internet makes the controversial case that we should leave slut in the past. She breaks down the dangerous ways young women and girls are trapped by the doomed expectation to be sexual but pure, to be good sluts and police each others femininity. Until the sexual double standard is eradicated, Tanenbaum thinks any use of the word slut does more harm than good, setting girls up for sexual violence and self-harm. I found it a thought-provoking and uncomfortable read, as someone who has tried to use the label of slut as an empowering identity. But I have to agree that reclaiming slut is only possible when your audience and community understands your intent; seeing InfoWars call me a self-proclaimed slut in a headline was a glaring lesson in having my words weaponized against me.",1,1

"My journey dates back to 2014. I remember that summer to be very busy as I had just gotten back to Lebanon from vacation and my son underwent surgery. Note that 2014 was the only year I skipped my mammography check-up. A year passed by and I presumed to my regular yearly screening and tests. However, that year was different. I got a call from my doctor, she was expressing concern and doubt as she saw a very small shadow in my mammography. To make sure everything is 100% okay, the doctor asked me to redo it. After that, she confirmed that there was something abnormal with my results but wasnt clear enough for accurate diagnosis. She then asked for a biopsy and I tested positive for breast cancer. They surgically removed the tumor and I went through 30 sessions of radiation. Although I am still taking a daily preventative pill, I consider myself to be lucky as the breast cancer was detected during its early stages. This experience taught me that regardless of how busy and messy life gets, never miss your yearly mammogram test. Face cancer fearlessly and stay positive. Everything is treatable if caught early on. -",0,0

"I recently bought this book for my children, and also a little for myself, because I'm a book addict, I'm curious for history, myths and legends and I love good illustrations. It's ""Geheimnisvolle Welt"" (which translates to ""Secret World"") by Astrid Otte, Elke Schwalm and Timo Grubing (), published by Circon Verlag (). As soon as we started reading, I noticed there was something very wrong with it. Not so much in terms of the topics and the information content, which is really interesting and well worded, but it was the illustrations that seriously caught my attention. I collected the most obvious ones here - swipe through to get an idea. Can you see it? The book is about interesting and mysterious things that have (or have not) happened in nature, history and evolution - think of Freemasonry, Loch Ness, Aurora Borealis and such. Two young teenagers, a girl and a boy, travel through the pages, being part of some of the scenes. Sometimes they're shown in equal positions, like standing next to one another. And sometimes, one of them is clearly the leader while the other is shown much smaller, anxious and weak. Now guess in how many percent of these cases the boy is the leader, and the girl is in the weaker position? Got it. 100%. Since I started thinking a lot about feminism and sexism a few years ago, I've become more and more sensitive to things like this. Sexism that doesn't hit your eye at the very first glance, like having a red, blinking arrow pointing at it, but that walks in silently, unnoticed. And still it leaves traces. It shows our daughters what role they're meant to be in. It shows them their words don't weigh as much as those of their brothers. It shows them that no matter how strong, clever or talented they might be, there'll always be a man who'll get the job. And yes, of course I have experienced this in person. Is there any woman on this planet who hasn't? I try to raise my kids, the boy and the girls, equally, giving them a sense of fairness and gender equality. But wow, sometimes I have the feeling the world is fighting back at me. How are your experiences?",0,0

"""The debate persists because in the United States, the resistance to public child care has never been mainly about economics. It has been rooted in a moral argument  that the proper place for mothers (at least certain ones) is at home with their children. 'In the United States, child care is still at the political level viewed symbolically and not economically,' said Leah Ruppanner, a sociologist at the University of Melbourne. 'All of the discussions are around the sanctity of motherhood, preserving the traditional family. Women and families are living very different lives from that.'""   ",0,0

"If a women is wearing leggings all is good, if she is wearing her underwear and posts this on the internet she might gets slut shamed, she might be called a hoe, a thot, ... (insert other urban dictionary synonyms for the word here) Sad thing is most of them who spread these hateful words are other girls (I say girls cause if you are a woman you wont do this to another woman). There is absofuckinglutly nothing wrong with showing of some skin and owning the body you have. I worked for my bum, I have cellulite and not afraid to show it, I wear underwear in my hip dip pictures so people can see them more cleary because I like to show that I embrace them but this does not make me a hoe. In fact if you look up the word in the dictionary most women dont even come close to the meaning of it. I understand that girls who spread this negativity arent in a good place in their life and I hope honest to god you will some day be as comfortable in your own skin as I am cause it feels freaking great. Us women need to lift eachother up cause you know what some men arent respectable about these pictures either. Post a pic like this or in your bikini and you bet your ass at least two or three guys will be in your dms telling you nasty stuff thinking youre easy and also a hoe. This honestly saddens me. I dont post these pics for your approval or for you to tell me Im hot. Let a girl (or guy) embrace the body they have, let them show it, let them own it. They arent any less worthy of respect for showing of some skin. In my opinion they deserve tons of respect for loving themselves. Lets just be kind and respectful to eachother cause these days loving yourself is hard enough we dont need to add judgement and hate from strangers on top off that. - Can I get a amen up in heeeere? new impact seamless in plum) - -",1,2

"Continuing this week's prompt for books that made me cry... Here's a (crap) photo from my archives of an amazing book you must read!  I finished EVERYDAY SEXISM a few days ago. One of the chapters reminded me of THE KNIFE OF NEVER LETTING GO, because it discusses the silencing of women. Todd grows up in an all-male world where everyone hears each other's thoughts. The dearth of women in all this ""noise"" is pivotal to the story.  In real life, our silencing is much more subtle. I was speaking to another woman recently who - with an exasperated shake of her head - said her husband jokingly calls her a raging feminist. And I why is it funny? Acting like feminism is a joke is a form of silencing so ingrained that even well-meaning men subscribe to it. I've hit the same wall when I challenge an unrepentant ""it was just a joke"". I'm silenced by the implication that I'm a humourless sourpuss. (Turns out I'm a raging too. Haha, the joke's on me. )  The worst form of silencing is taking away my victimhood. It's men telling me I'm overreacting or being offended when I spurn them. It's being told to think of the repercussions if I publicly complain about a man - how might it reflect on that guy, on myself, our acquaintances, our employers? Will I get into trouble?  The notion that women bring sexism upon themselves like lightning rods of calamity, that we are both victim and perpetrator, has shaped my existence. It informs what I wear, how I become quiet when a strange man makes me uncomfortable, and why I sometimes hesitate to challenge sexism, because when has speaking up ever gotten me anything?  ""There's her silence,"" Todd thinks, ""loud as a roar, pulling at me like the greatest sadness ever, like I want to take it and press myself into it and just disappear forever down into nothing."" . .",0,0

"Stop calling me a nurse. Stop stereotyping on the basis of sex. Stop assuming the role of women in the workplace. Stop undermining my rights to have a career of my choice. Just stop.   Let me just tell you truthfully, there hasnt been a single day in the last two weeks that Ive been in the OR where I havent been called a nurse. The worse part is, when their curiosity gets deeper and they find out I am a surgical resident, the shock on their face is even more offensive. Dont get me wrong, I would be honored to be a nurse, its one of the most important and hardest jobs in healthcare so its not about being a nurse if I was one BUT I am not okay with the assumption that I AM a nurse simply based on my gender or perhaps the fact that I have my hair and make up done at 6 am that leads them to assume. Whatever it is that I am doing that makes me LOOK less like a doctor, is a stereotype in 2019 and it has GOT TO GO. Whether youre a doctor, PA, nurse, pharmacist or any other position in the hospital you should not be categorized based on your appearance. And this is where we ALL can make a when you see discrimination, of any kind, say something and leave a lasting impression. Heres what I mean, in dental school, I was called a hygienist all the time. I usually smiled, and said no I am a dentist and then moved on. I didnt feel like making a fuss about it would do anything. I was mostly silent and I allowed people to continue judging. NOW I no longer do that. When I am wrongly assumed to be something I am not and I feel its on the basis of gender, I smile, say something and then move on. My usually go to technique is sarcasm. The reason why I use humor in response to these stereotypes is because it is too subtle to cause scene but sharp enough to make a point. My mission isnt to fight with everyone, its to breakdown the barriers by first saying something and then eventually doing something.

"What is a ""thirst trap""..... The confidence of a woman in her sexual frequency and sharing that with the world..? Let's think about this for a second... The thirst is coming from the other person who is seeking to find something specific within that particular person right? They are thirsty for something.. Usually this saying is all around sex... However it could be deeper than that... which is usually always is... So let's address the word.. ""trap"".... The way this is stated is that the woman who is embodying her sexuality, sexiness, sensuality, and confidence thru her physical expression is only doing so to attract someone to her.. or.... lure him to her web... (Exhibition or validation.. an episode I'm working on for the show) The evil sexually empowered woman... (Lilith running thru me) ... CAUSING the man to take his eyes away from his current partner (witch wound and the illusion of ""mine"" is an upcoming episode on Rising Goddess Radio).. taking something from another and trapping it in her web of sexual prowess.... Slut.. Whore.. Skank.. Bitch.. ... interesting... So ultimately calling someone a ""thirst trap"" is another form of slut shaming, because you (proverbial you who is calling people this based off their choices of sexually empowered photos) are seeing something within them that triggers fear of loss.. OR... if you are the person who is ""thirsty""... calling this person who is trapping you with their thirst, the problem, and ultimately not having to take responsibility for the triggered emotions and thought processes and actions coming from that trigger.... ... interesting... What are your thoughts? Oh! And to summer... because I'm traveling back to Aurora in a week, and it's snowing... Soooo.... sunlight and warmth and string bikinis... Cause . . .",0,0

"Slut-shaming. What a really interesting word. Personally, Im a user of this term, and Im against slut-shaming. Im against people shaming someone because they do things that apparently a slut would do  wearing heavy makeup, wearing a dress of a particular length, etc, etc.., Also when people shame rape victims for the time/place/existence of theirs, I tell them to not slut-shame them. Stop slut-shaming women is something Ive advocated for a lot. I tell people not to slut-shame someone, because a slut is a bad thing to be  thats what Ive been meaning. Well, thats what the usage means  its a derogatory, bad term. But I think I need to present forth why this caught my curiosity and got me into A slut is someone who has sexual relationships with many men. Also, someone like a prostitute. Dictionary defines slut as a woman who has many casual sexual partners, a sexually promiscuous person. Also surely, the term slut doesnt refer to a woman who is a rapist. In wokeness, having sex is not bad. Being sexually promiscuous though, is unhealthy, but thats a lot complicated too, and were not talking about that. But the whole idea of asking people to stop shaming a girl as a slut, because the word is derogatory  is it derogatory because sex is immoral? Is it derogatory because it is a WOMAN who is sexually promiscuous, and thus immoral? Is it derogatory because being a prostitute is... bad? (Which we arent talking about now either, for theres so much complications when it comes to prostitution.) If having casual sex is bad/derogatory, why is there no such thing as a slut-shaming a man? There is no equivalent term for slut for a sexually promiscuous man as far as I know. Im not comparing men and women, nor am I saying that thereby men should be slut-shamed. But Im pointing out how this simply points out to the idea of sexual oppression and control we have. Do I mean that its simply okay for someone to shame someone as a slut and I dont have to mind about it? No. But Im talking about WHAT makes someone a slut, who is a slut, how people treat a slut and why we SHAME a slut. .",0,0

"BEING DRESS-CODED Ive been tracking and writing about slut-shaming for over 20 years. Recently, I began exploring the ways in which school dress codes often play a role in perpetuating slut-shaming. School administrators typically defend dress codes by arguing that revealing outfits are distracting to other students. Ironically, these codes result in the opposite Girls bodies become the center of attention because monitoring students clothes means paying close attention to their bodies and, by extension, their sexuality. Girls are simultaneously sexualized and punished for being sexualized. I recently launched the Instagram project to create a space to collect individual stories and, more importantly, look for patterns and learn from a larger, collective story about sexism and sexual objectification. Im also interested in the way racial discrimination operates with dress coding. Girls of color are more frequently dress-coded than white girls because school officials tend to monitor and scrutinize their bodies more. I also use the term dress-coded in a broad sense to include the experiences in which someone of any age or gender is called out by their peers, colleagues, or strangers for wearing clothing judged too revealing or sexualized. Nearly all women have been dress-coded at some point. But regardless of whether or not an individual has personally experienced dress-coding, the fact that we all know we could be dress-coded influences the way girls and women behave, think, and feel regarding our bodies and sexuality.

"This is fascinating! Did you see these articles (I'm including a short link below and you can click through to the original study)? The study results from a comparison of 2016 to 2018 reports of sexual harassment show that reports of sexual coercion and unwanted sexual attention have gone down significantly BUT reports of gender-based harassment have gone UP significantly. That is not surprising, but is SUPER INTERESTING!   My researcher peeps can correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks from this research like gender-based harassment has basically replaced previous unwanted sexual attention and sexual coercion. This is so consistent with other research - sexual harassment, in any form, is about power. It's not about sexual attraction.   The other amazing thing from this study is that it reports in 2016, women were reporting significant shame and self-blame when they experienced sexual harassment, and now that is basically eliminated. So cool!!   Other people's actions say something about them, not something about you!   ",1,2

Then at the same moment thinking about the Anniversary of Apollo 11 and the bigger view of all that dared to travel to space , talk about a lonely job in a lonely place and all the risk involved ... .. Anyway, from a Facebook comment to a Starbucks sketch, to this image of the highly emotional imaginings of a girl working a lonely street corner longing to be home instead, connecting all of those dots and maintaining some humor as well ...

"Feminisim used to be something good when it was first founded. Now Feminisim is about bashing and demonizing men in order to pick women up. Women are overly praised while Men are constantly bashed, smeared and demonized on a daily basis. 3rd Wave Feminisim has shamed and vilified men for their normal male behavior to the point where a man can't tell a woman he likes her clothes without being falsely accused of sexual harassment, falsely accused of being a pervert and falsely being accused of objectifying women for simply giving a compliment on a woman's clothing. Feminisim blames all men for women's short comings and fights for a patriarchy that is no longer existent. They call men Sexist and Misogynistic which has lost all meaning because Radical Feminists are constantly looking for Sexism and Misogyny everywhere when there is none. They continue to push the wage gap narrative when it has been in fact debunked numerous times and they have weponized the movement which has resulted in many men being falsely accused of Sexual Harassment and rape and their lives are destroyed in the process due to these false accusations. 3rd Wave Feminists shame and demonize masculinity and shame and demonize Men with normal masculine traits.

"When I was 8 years old, I was sexually violated by a member of my beloved village (no one that I've ever spoken of or posted on social media) As a result of this life changing event, I buried it in the back of my mind and didn't speak of it it until I was 35 years old. Buried it so far back, when I DID think about it, I wondered if it even happened!? Oh but it did. It took away some of the most special people, places, and things in my life.

"THIS. This right here is justice for a woman who was severely wronged by the system. She has been in prison for 15 years. Cyntoia is now 31. Originally she was tried as an adult and sentenced to 51-life. [triggering back story] At 16 years old she was sex trafficked by a man who consistently beat, threatened, and raped her. She was forced to sell her body for this man. She was forced to give her money and freedom to this man. At 16 years old she was forced to have sex with a 43 year old man whom she felt threatened by and killed. Anything past that reasoning doesnt matter. She was 16. She was trafficked and being raped.

""When mothers do seek high-profile jobs, whether in government or in the private sector, theyre often asked how they balance work and family.

Seth Moulton (D-MA), 'If you were a woman, the first question I would be asking you is, how are you going to juggle having an infant at home and a presidential campaign?'  But asking only women that question perpetuates the idea that child care is womens responsibility, something for them to figure out without the men in their lives. So Vox decided instead to ask all the male 2020 Democratic candidates with young children at home to describe their child care arrangements  who was caring for their kids, we asked, when they were off campaigning?""

"Let's slut shaming. Whenever I've challenged anyone to define the word slut to me, I've always been presented with the same old answers. 'Someone who sleeps with anyone and everyone', 'someone who just looks slutty', 'someone who's got loads of kids by loads of different men', 'someone who works in the sex industry'. My usual response is 'hmmm ok then', but lately I've started to respond a bit differently. What is it to you if a lady decides to sleep with 1 man or 10,000 men? Who gave you the right to label her? If she's happy, safe and not hurting anybody, then what business is it of yours? If you don't approve of a lady who has had more than one sexual partner, then why don't you just keep up your search for perfection and move on without tearing her down first? Slut labelling sticks like shit to a blanket and is a sure fire way to smash someone's confidence to smithereens, if they genuinely care what people think. I'm 29 years old and pretty sure I'm not a slut but even now when I'm approached by a man, my after thoughts are, he probably only spoke to me because he's heard I'm a slag or thinks I look 'well up for it'. These words are damaging and if I'm totally honest, pretty fucking annoying. My philosophy is, there are no such thing as sluts, if you mind your own damn business",0,0
"Posted   I first learned to be ashamed of my boobs when I was 13. A random man on a vehicle passing by groped me. I was awe struck and in pain. First came a wave of absolute surprise, then an unpleasant confusion, then fear and shame. How can somebody just do that? Is that okay for strangers to grope people? Well I didn't know back then. The only thing I knew was that I had been wronged. I had to respond. So I did. I swore at the top of my voice until the guy rode off in panic. Imagine a 13 year old kid, who only recently hit puberty, unsure of her own body, raised by parents who were shy to talk much about growing up experiencing something so bizarre. The worst thing is, it's not the only such experience I've had. Just like most other girls and boys. Imagine the normalcy of that, harassed, 'like most others'. That's how widespread the issue is. The only way I had some closure from that experience, and the ones that followed (yes, there were a few) was my response. If you ever experience abuse or sexual violence of any sort, respond. Your voice can not only help you, but others. Sexual abuse is a crime we need to eradicate. Men and women are targets of sexual abuse. Talk to your male friends too. In our society, unfortunately, the male victims of harassment and rape tend to keep quiet due to shame, fear, ideas of masculinity, the society's perception of homophobia and many more factors.

"The following is an abridged excerpt from Christina Hoff Sommers' brilliant book, The War Against Take Our Daughters to Work Day, the school holiday for girls introduced by the Ms. Foundation for Women, is now in its ninth year. For the first few years, it was a girls-only event. For their part, the Ms. organizers remain adamantly opposed to including boys. In 1996, Marie Wilson, president of the Ms. Foundation, began working with some feminist men's groups to design a separate holiday for boys. If boys had their own day, the pressure would be off. The first Son's Day was planned for Sunday, October 20, 1996. October was especially desirable because, as the Ms. planners pointed out, ""October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, so there will be lots of activities scheduled."" Here are some of the ways ""Son's Day"" was to be Take your sonor 'son for a day'to an event that focuses on ending men's violence against women. Call the Family Violence Prevention Fund at 800-END-ABUSE for information. Plan a game or sport in which the contest specifically does not keep score or declare a winner. Invite the community to watch and celebrate boys playing on teams for the sheer joy of playing. Since Son's Day is on Sunday, make sure your son is involved in preparing the family for the work and school week ahead. This helping lay out clothes for siblings and making lunches. For boys not exhausted by all the fun and excitement of the day's activities, the Ms. planners had a suggestion for the Take your son grocery shopping then help him plan and prepare the family's evening meal on Son's Day. As the Ms. staff had planned it, Son's Day would not even give the boys a day off from school. ====== Continue the book",0,0

"Im not a football fan in the slightest, but there are always stories which will catch my attention. Was really pleased to hear that Megan Rapinoe won and award last night, and chuffed when appeared to be giving equal coverage to her and her male counterpart. And then I was crushingly disappointed. In a move which screams , the link from the homepage takes you through to the article which focuses on the men. Rapinoes win is reduced to a sentence, which neither mentions her achievements (the mens are) nor namechecks any of her peers (again, the men are). Theres a separate article about the womens awards (which were given at the same event)... and its not linked to in this article. At the grand old age of 32, I spent my lunch break sending a steaming email to the BBC in order to complain. I actually included the sentence, Do better., and referred to the move as, a significant own goal. If you in any way agree with me, please stand up for and send a message - Ill lend you my words if you like. I feel so ashamed that our publicly-funded broadcaster and news service has treated a womans achievements in this way, but Im also sadly unsurprised. As my sister said, its probably a man who will read and ignore my email. And if youre sitting there reading this and thinking, why are you making a fuss about this? then youre part of the problem and you, more than anyone, need to take a seat and listen again. I suspect will also be unsurprised, and Id love if we can do something about it (a little help or or )",0,0

"Todays dresses. Is there a place for dresses in a gender neutral wardrobe? My daughter wears gender neutral clothes in terms of colours and motifs, but Im having this dilemma. On the one its only our stereotypical ideas about dresses that makes us think theyre for girls, and so why shouldnt our sons wear dresses too? So the answer is that instead of not buying dresses for our daughters, we are instead open to all children wearing them, regardless of gender. On the other its easy for me to say that as a mother to a daughter, but how many parents would actually feel comfortable buying dresses for their sons? And because dresses ARE seen as gendered for females, like it or not, the best way to go gender neutral is not to clothe her in dresses at all but instead in, say, babygros and shorts and t-shirts.

"Slut-shaming involves criticizing women for their transgression of accepted codes of sexual conduct,[12] i.e., admonishing them for behavior, attire or desires that are more sexual than society finds acceptable.[13][14][15][16] Author Jessalynn Keller stated, ""The phrase [slut-shaming] became popularized alongside the SlutWalk marches and functions similarly to the 'War on Women,' producing affective connections while additionally working to reclaim the word 'slut' as a source of power and agency for girls and women.""[3] Slut-shaming is used by men and women.[17][18] Slut-shaming functions among girls and women as a way of sublimating sexual jealousy ""into a socially acceptable form of social critique of girls' or women's sexual expression.""[12] The term is also used to describe victim blaming for rape and other sexual assault. This is done by stating the crime was caused (either in part or in full) by the woman wearing revealing clothing or acting in a sexually provocative manner, before refusing consent to sex,[10] thereby absolving the perpetrator of guilt.

"What Ho Chaps and Chappesses! How are you? Looking fabulous today! Ding Dong! Let's talk about Catherine of Aragon. Poor old cow had a rotten life. She married a chap called Prince Arthur who died a year into their marriage. Because parents were a bit crap back in the 1500's she was then married to Henry VIII of England. Whilst the marriage started out rosey, Henry started bonking around and got all ""aggy"" that Cazza wasn't giving him a son. Then Anne ""Might have Introduced the Blowjob to England"" Boleyn came on the scene. Cazza, devoutly Catholic, swore blind she hadn't bonked Arthur so Henners had no reason to divorce her... Bible Drama. The Pope refused the divorce, so Henners, determined to get into Anne's knickers, broke with the Roman Catholic Church and set up his own religion.... The Psychotic Bastard Religion as calls it. Actually called The Church of England. He Married Anne, cut her head off and started marrying everyone he met. Cazza was relegated to Dowager Princess of Wales and died alone in 1536. When Henry, her ex, found out he threw a party. Nice. Poor old cow.",0,0
"Women aren't good at maths or science From a young age, women are subtly discouraged from pursuing maths and science due to their reputation as boys subjects. While this year more girls took science A Levels than boys, there were still many more boys taking maths, physics and computer science. Research shows theres a negligible difference in mathematical aptitude, and that poorer performance can be directly caused by awareness of this insidious and ill-founded belief that girls are somehow innately not as good. This undermining of performance has been researched across many groups who are stereotyped as not as good at certain things. For example, a white 100 metre sprinter will not run as fast competing in a race against black sprinters because of the impact of this stereotype threat. We need more women in STEM careers, so lets break down the myth, take away the stereotype threat and encourage women to thrive in *all* fields.",1,1

Recently the actor opened up about her philosophy around love when she appeared on an episode of BFFs with Vogue Season 3, aired on Colors Infinity. Speaking about temptations Radhika said  Of course you get tempted. You dont have to be an actor to be tempted. In life, you meet so many people and there are so many wonderful people and you get tempted. Sometimes its a physical attraction, sometimes its just admiration and that can be very potent also and I think thats beautiful. Why would you not address that aspect of your life? She also commented on the fact that how sometimes we blame ourselves for the natural emotion of falling with many people at the same time  I believe in falling in love with many people. I love too many people at the same time also on various levels and in various ways. Like how I could love dancing and acting, why cant I love you and you in different ways?

Im not showing up to work in lingerie but after working so hard on being comfortable with my body, Im proud that Ive gotten here emotionally and physically and I like to wear what makes me feel good.

Was it the length of my dress, Was it my short skirt, Was it my body shape, Was it my walk, Was it my talk, Was it my smile, Or the look in my eyes, That made you, Push yourself onto me, That made you, Strip me of humanity, That made you, Use my secret haven, That made you, Break and robe me, That made you, Use me like a sex machine, Is it me, Or is it you? Did I do anything wrong, Or did I force you To see a sex tool in me, Is it my dressing, Or is it your MIND? . .

There is this argument about women dressing provocatively. Is it me who is dressing provocatively or is it your mind that thinks it is provocative. Is it me or you who has a pornographic sexualized mind that anything that looks like the women in your phone is asking for sex. God did not punish Bathsheba for bathing outside where ""David"" would see but ""David"" for looking, and looking the second time and going on to look and then desiring and then acting on his desires. When you say it's my fault that i am assaulted because of my dressing that also implies the man who assaltued me is an animal with low self control and should not be allowed to walk on the streets.

"With age comes certain obligations. I use quotations because theyre not obligations I feel inclined to follow. Were obligated to cover ourselves. Were obligated to live up to others expectations. Were obligated to watch our language and behave in a manner suited for others perceptions. When we dont fall in line, were deemed unfit. Unworthy of affection, kindness, and at times, the smallest forms of human decency. etc. As a society, we force our own views on to the world around us. When anyone refuses to fall in line, we attempt to force them in to compliance through negative interactions. We have become obsessed with how everything looks. We ignore anything that isnt . That doesnt fall in to a made up definition of how things should be. When was it that we stopped thinking of the people around us? When did we lose our compassion for others?

"""Journalist said the lack of support from powerful progressives such as during his reporting on sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein felt like a ""gut punch."" ""It is an example of how power protects power,"" Farrow said in an appearance on BuzzFeed News' AM to DM on Tuesday to discuss his new book Catch and Kill, in which he says NBC News tried to quash his reporting on Weinstein. Farrow's story went on to win a Pulitzer Prize after it was published in the New Yorker, and helped launch the movement and a public reckoning about sexual misconduct by powerful men Farrow recalled that he was due to interview former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for his last book, War on The End of Diplomacy and the Decline of American Influence (published in 2018), when word got around political circles that he was working on a story about Harvey Weinstein. ""There was an apparent effort to cancel that interview after they raised concerns about the reporting on Weinstein,"" Farrow said.

A new study shows womens brains are no more efficient at switch between/juggling tasks than mens are. 2) Women are NOT better at seeing mess than men. In one study, researchers found men and women equally rated a space as messy. The reason men do less cleaning than women may lie in the fact that women are held to higher standards of cleanliness than men, rather than mens dirt blindness. The lesson? We need to dismantle these myths in the workplace. The assumption women are better multitaskers can influence the allocation of administrative tasks. Tasks like taking minutes and organising meetings should not be allocated based on gender.",1,1

"Ever wonder why the line is so long for womens restrooms? 1. Pregnancy and menstruation cause women to have to use the restroom more frequently 2. Women are often responsible for bringing their children to the bathroom 3. Young moms need the space for breastfeeding   So why havent architects considered the accessibility of womens restrooms? In newer buildings this is beginning to be addressed, but in old buildings, the building codes required more space for men since women were primarily restricted to the home at the time. Until 2011, even the U.S. House of Representatives didnt have a womens restroom near the Speakers Lobby, while the mens closely located restroom had a fireplace, a shoeshine stand, and televised floor proceedings.

"Pssst... We are a week from Musings of a Fat, Black Muslim  hitting bookstore shelves, sent to your home, and just getting to see your beautiful faces at these events. People keep asking me how do I feel about all of this, ya know having my deep dark secrets out in full view? To be honest, as I am excited, I am equally terrified. There are topics in the book that Ive never shared with the public. And especially as a Muslim woman, we are to remain pure in the public eye. We are to be covered and devout and quiet and non-sexual. We are never to taint what the world views as a perfect practicing Hijabi. We arent afforded mistakes. But men get oh, boys will be boys and 99 excuses for their fuckery. One of the topics I cover is sexuality and virginity. I wont give anything away, but I was extremely uncomfortable writing some of these stories. I couldnt get out of my head, that Im going to hell for sharing these things as a Muslim woman. It has been etched into my head that Muslim women just dont explore or talk about sexuality, among other things. We are to stay naive. Even now, Im not sure how I will prepare myself for the onslaught of negativity that this topic in particular will get from the Muslim community. I cant stress this enough, Im not the poster child for Islam. Yes, Im Muslim but I dont speak for all Muslims. Nor are we one size fits all. Why do women have to play the pious virgin role in order to not be deemed as that kind of girl?

"Mrs couch and Mrs little have had a lesbian fish marriage for over two years. (Which is like 30 in fish time) they have both laid thousands of eggs together, and built a beautiful home. After the flowerhorn extravaganza, and the heartbreaking loss of Humphrey, I put Humphreys daughter in with the happy couple. Months go by without issue. Until Mrs couch notices that the young flowerhorn is... kinda cute actually. What does this orange slut do? She decided to pair up with humphreys daughter! Rubbing all over each other, both with their egg tubes out, while poor Mrs little sits in the corner, absolutely heartbroken. they could have had a beautiful polyamorous relationship. A threesome even. But no, there was no communication or warning. Just a sudden and painful divorce. Dyke drama is everywhere, even in fish tanks. About to make Mrs little a tinder account.

"Follow That's really a heart wrenching news. He was charged with allegations of harassment which later was cleared by the harassment committee, but definitely after bringing alot of damage to his repute. He would have been under immense stress and mental trauma lead to this extreme step. Sadly, in this society one has to commit suicide for proving himself innocent. The lecturer in his suicide note asserted that he is leaving the matter to Allah and asked police not to investigate the matter further. Harassment has nothing to do with only feminism, both are vulnerable to harassment so there should be a law for both men and women. To the women who play this blame game, should must be brought in front of media with name and shame as she must have done it for the sake of fame. Teacher student is kinda a respect and honorable relationship, sadly it is being affected day by day.. We are living in an immoral society where most of the times women filling their eyes with tears will make you think yes they are indeed the victim, and not only women but men also say that     . Man can't stand for man in this matter. Why so? Men themselves let women think all men are same. How can everyone be same? Five fingers are not equal. In our society we have some women who has nothing but the woman card and plays with it all the time in the name of feminist. This propaganda has to be stopped at first, it ain't a compaign anymore rather an agenda to knock down men for the so called ""women respect"". Respect can't be have forcefully, it demands hardwork,, you have to earn it. This feminism shit ain't gonna brought you this. . . . . . . . . .",0,0

"Can we all agree that Harvey Weinstein is the devil and is an angel for exposing the devastating abuse conducted for so long by Hollywoods elite? . . Catch and Kill Review 5/5 . . Catch and Kill follows Farrow as he investigates allegations (which turn out to be true) that one of Hollywoods most powerful producers is a serial predator. Additionally, the story shows how Weinstein and other wealthy men use intimidation and surveillance to threaten journalists, evade accountability, and silence victims. . . This is a must read book! Farrow meticulously details the sources and evidence he gathered in reporting, while also detailing how the powerful elite tried to stop his reporting every step of the way. From NDAs, to threatening legal action, to Israeli spy groups, its truly unbelievable the lengths that Weinstein went to squash this story. . My favorite part of the book was reading about the strong, brave women who shared their story when they had everything to lose. Catch and Kill is truly a powerful story and Im so happy that this reporting came to light and these women got some semblance of justice. . In conclusion...read this book. Its great . . .",0,0

"When I was 14 ,my high school English teacher Mr Rogers used to make me stand in the corner. When I would refuse, he would step towards me while I was seated at my desk, stand over me , sometimes with an erect penis and demand that I comply with his obscene and obviously sexually motivated punishments. During parent teacher conference, my Mom was shocked as Mr Rogers said I had a behavior problem and he claimed I was not college bound because if It. My Mom knew better as I had a box of academic awards and never had a teacher claim I was disruptive. After the conference she asked me if he did anything inappropriate , as she was creeped out by how often Mr Rogers used the word discipline during the meeting. I was so embarrassed that I allowed him to do this weird sexual stuff to me instead of finding the courage to walk out of class, that I told my Mom nothing happened, thus allowing him to do this to me for the rest of the semester. One time I even started my period while he was making me stand in the corner and he refused to let me go to the rest room. Sometimes boys in the class would make comments about girls bodies while we were standing in the corner (not their fault, they were kids too). It was HELLISH The police department stated that even if 100 former students witnessed Mr Rogers get an erection, that its not a prosecutable crime. As a former educator and child and family services contractor, I know what men like him are capable of. his actions are indicative of sexual deviancy. Ive had an easy time reporting things that have happened to me as an adult, but the district did not make this easy. They first accused me of not complying with the investigation because I did not want to sit down with Mr Rogers at the school he abused me at and sat on my complaint for over a month because the Director of HR wanted to wait until summer is over. inschools",1,1

Male privilege is casual sexism. But what concerns me more is sexism imposed by women on women. A trickle down effect and basically trauma thats being passed on.

The same female who gushes over the men standing beside me, ready to tear off her dignity and launch herself into his arms.

I want to build a world for my daughter where this isn't the norm anymore. Where rape culture doesn't exist, where the saying 'boys will be boys' won't apply to the harassment of a woman, and where women aren't given the job based on how big their breasts are, but are given opportunities because of their intellect, willpower, and hard work.

"HOW MUCH FOR A NIGHT. Part 2/3. By Kamana Rai. ----- Once I understand the question, the shock of it finally catches up. Im not a fucking prostitute! I exclaim in English. I feel ashamed to say this, but in the moment, I am unable to say anything else, unable to confront him any other way. I am astounded by this man's audacity. How dare he ask me how much I charge? How dare he make such assumptions about me and the men I am hanging out with? He asks me if I understand Hindi. I look back at him angrily. He says, no? Okay, thank you. Bye bye. He walks away. Dumbfounded, I enter the room and tell the guys what happened. Theyre also irked by the mans actions. When I begin to cry, my friend takes me outside the room to give me some privacy and comfort. The cleaner happens to be right downstairs. Upon confrontation, the cleaner tells me that he never said that, that he never asked that, that he was only asking if I knew Hindi. I want to spit on his face. Back and forth, we argue. He accuses me of misunderstanding his intentions, and I accuse him of being a narrow-minded sexist. . . . . . . . .",0,0

"In August 2016, while I was getting my yearly mammogram, the doctor noticed I had small breast cysts. He, therefore, asked me to perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As a result, we found out I had cancerous large breast tumours (2.5 cm). The news came as a heartfelt blow. I was shocked; especially that no one in my family had cancer. I did not expect the disease to invade my life. This was very confusing. It was more like an earthquake than anything else. I will not lie; we cried a lot, all of me, my husband and our three daughters. We couldnt believe what was happening and how. I was fine. I didnt even feel any symptoms. However, I did not let cancer define me or take over my life. I couldnt see my family break down in front of me anymore. I accepted the challenge and decided to fight the battle without complaining or nagging. I used to wake up every day  and with all the pain I was enduring  I made sure to wear full make-up, a wig and a smile before leaving my room in the morning. I lost my hair, nails, eyebrows, eyelashes  I lost half of me but did not surrender. I wanted to be strong and full of energy in front of my children. My family was my strength and number one supporter. I was never in this alone, thanks to them, and we managed all together to get out of this dark and long tunnel. Today, I am a breast cancer survivor, and I call on every woman to think about her family and keep in mind that early detection can save her life. In my case, the yearly checkup saved me. I took action immediately or else I wouldnt have survived. Health is the most precious in the world. And most importantly stay positive and keep smiling. -",0,0

"I was fourteen when a boy in my class told me my face would look better on a naked body. Schools don't teach you how to deal with unwanted sexual comments so I laughed it off and continued to be friends with him. Almost six months later, he tried to slide his hands from my waist till my hips while posing for a picture. I didn't know if I should fight back or let it go, so I just moved away and told him I am not looking nice enough for photograph right now. A month later, I came to know I'm the class slut and that I allow boys to touch me inappropriately. Schools don't teach you how to deal with slut-shaming. When I finally spoke against it, my class teacher called me 'dirty people' in front of 40 other fifteen year olds. By the time I passed out, our entire batch assumed I slept with men for money. It's been 7 years since school ended, Still, whenever a boy looks at my naked body while we're making love and tells me how beautiful I am, my mind runs back to 2011 and I'm haunted by the words that were thrown at me like I were a dumping ground, existing only to hold all the garbage that people keep discarding, making me realise that I am infact 'dirty'. I am dirty, because everyone around me excreted their shitty mentalities, put them in a bag, and emptied them on me. Dirty, because that's what they call women they ejaculate their toxic morals in, Dirty, because they're too scared to clean the mess they make everytime they shame anyone, Dirty, because, with time, we learned how to fight back, Dirty, because they're so used to living in the filth that is their mind, that they fear anything that's strong and beautiful. Dirty, because schools taught us about flinging our dustbin bags towards the dumping grounds but forgot to teach us how to not to create harmful waste in the first place. . . .",1,2

The story of reporters Jodie Kantor and Megan Twoheys investigation into and exposure of Harvey Weinstein, it has all the adrenalin of a thriller but the added clout of being depressingly true.

Immediately after crossing the street, a garbage truck pulls up next to me, slowing traffic, so all three men could blow kisses and stick their tongues out at me. Normally Id walk away but I felt so upset and they werent moving, so I stuck my middle finger at them in frustration. Immediately they burst into laughter - this horrible devious laughter. We were on a street with a lot of traffic so they kept slowing down or speeding up to get next to me and verbally harrass me. I turned onto the nearest street the first chance I had just to avoid these men. I am so upset that I cant walk to work without feeling dirty and violated.",0,0

"If you were a victim of rape or human trafficking, you must be aware that time alone does not heal you. You must take the necessary steps to heal. Do exercise daily, explore your painful emotions in writing, cry all you need and let it go, live a more spiritual life, attend support groups, read the empowering post in my social media and research this topic, volunteer creating awareness about this problem and empower other women, live in the present and set new goals in life, learn something new, attend concerts, book signings, etc. The more you focus on yourself the stronger and happier you will become. ,,,,,,",0,0

"Yesterday was a difficult day added on to a hard week. That is always hard for me to admit. I always put everyone else before me. It's just what I do. It probably doesn't help that i say I'm ok, that I'm always ok, even when I'm not. I just find a way to bury it and put it away and keep going. It's hard to heal when we have to constantly hide that we are hurting. The stigma we face while we struggle to cope is dangerous.

"2/3 After a few days of intense rainfall, the air cleared itself, covering the nearby hills in a dense fog. We drove along an asphalt road all the way to the valleys. Stalls with hats and corn stood on the roadside. All identical. I have seen no one stop by. It seemed that the salesmen were not looking for money there, but for killing time, which flows differently in Armenia, sluggishly, like a river deprived of the stream. Following the faces of the drivers filling the frames of my world for a fraction of a second, I realized that there was no woman among them. Since then, I have sharpened my eyesight and tried to capture every passing car looking for representatives of my sex behind the wheel. Unsuccessfully. I wonder where it comes from. Is it a question of upbringing, lack of resources, determination or interest? Or maybe its my oversight? I didnt know who to ask. There were men on the streets. - One of them stopped offering a ride to the store. I was not alone. We agreed. I sat in the back seat while Jasiek took the seat next to the driver. I remember his dark hair, his low height and his eyesight reflected in the mirror. He asked about my name and origin. He smiled and turned to me. We parked next to the supermarket. I thanked him for the ride, grabbed the handle and at the same time heard a voice coming from the front seat. - Close the door and dont open it. - I looked at Janek, but his eyes shone with a similar kind of disbelief. The driver insisted that I stay inside. Afterwards, he just kept repeating my name and obsessively wandering with his eyes over my body. Overflowed with anger, I let Janek know we were going out and pushed the door. The car followed us, but after a while, it disappeared into the chaos of the streets. I felt that there was only me and a great sense of disgust filling my interior. - // Our dearest ready for a trad climb!!! .france .world",0,0

"     Even in red pill circles, there is a lot of joking about men being disrespected by their woman, whether physically or verbally. Those guys are considered simps and cucks. At the same time, many red-pilled men and women work to support male victims of domestic abuse and complain about them not being taken seriously.

"Are you curious about how your body works when you experience pleasure?

Literally. They host a series of experience dinners in which they question norms and behavior in the context of sexuality. During the dinner Joes + Manon will serve some of the challenges and opportunities within sexuality. As dinner guest you can expect an interactive experience in which the conversation about the topics is facilitated in an original and surprisingly delicious way. The orgasm gap will be cut away, taboos will be spiced up and stereotypes will be made into pulp. The experience dinners show the constructive and positive role of design in debating difficult and intimate subjects. The dinner is designed in close collaboration with Petra Tiemessen, Seksuologen in Sp and Rutgers, the Dutch authority on research & sexuality.

"I have always felt awkward when people make statements about ""Modesty"" and also describe how to be modest. And I cringe when the ""go to"" description of modesty is always a cover up dress. . I believe that modesty should be self defined, because what is ""modest"" to you may not be ""modest to me. And with cultural differences it will be ignorant to think that your definition of modesty is what it should be. . And it's important that we don't go out shoving our personal opinion down People's throat, and in a bid to enforce it, making them uncomfortable or even going as far as assaulting them. . Several times I've seen people disregard a case of someone being sexually assaulted on the basis of their ""immodest"" dressing and it makes me sick because, modesty goes more than our physical appearance, it's in our character, our manners, how we treat people, Modesty is in empathy and understanding. . And however one chooses to dress is MODEST. The only person allowed to define modesty is the person themselves. And for our shoot I wanted to represent different form of modesty. THIS IS MODESTY. . ------------",0,0

Me Too It saddened me to see that a man had to commit suicide to prove his innocence. Sexual harassment is a bitter reality of our society but so are the opportunist women who leave no stone unturned for their gains even if it requires voicing fake claims.

"I read a lot of articles on a daily basis. My goal has always been to bring experimental findings from the academic world and apply it in design. It's been an exciting process, replete with obstacles and wins. In the last week I read a research paper that hit me, and hard. In a paper called ""When do we confront"", it was found that confrontation was a function of status and familiarity and nature of affront. Women were more likely to confront sexism when it came from.someone familiar and were peers. But here's the uncomfortable truth. They created a typology of the type of sexism and created 3 - a. Sexist remarks b. Unfairness c. Sexual attention. Women were less likely to confront when it is sexual attention. While the paper did not deep dive into this nugget, it got me thinking. How frightening it is, that somewhere deep down, we still believe that we are responsible for the dress down that we get. For the contours of our body. For the biological shape of our body. Sexuality was never about nudity. Skin is skin is skin and nothing more. Women, confront. Their eyes undressing is a remark on their immaturity, not on your virtue. But you already know this, Don't you?",0,0

"Everyday Sexism by ~ This book gave me an insight in many other womens experiences of daily sexism and its heartbreakingly vile and disgusting. That in the 21st century this is still a problem is almost too ridiculous to be believable. Its also ridiculous that it took me years to realise that what I experienced at 14! was sexual assault and not in any way, shape or form normal! This is a collection of stories that sparked many different emotions in I felt angry, defeated, hopeless, sad and powerless... but by the end it also gave me hope, it helped me gain perspective, it ignited a fire in me and it inspired me to find ways to be more active and to use my voice for the causes in believe in, even if I have to shout to do so. Questo libro mi ha aiutata ad avere un quadro pi completo riguardo il sessismo che molte donne devono sopportare quotidianamente ed  straziante, disgustoso e ripugnante. Il fatto che nel 21esimo secolo questo sia ancora un problema  quasi troppo ridicolo per essere credibile.  altrettanto ridicolo che mi ci siano voluti anni per rendermi conto che ci che ho subito a 14 anni fosse violenza sessuale e che non sia in alcun modo ok! Questa raccolta di storie ha scatenato molte emozioni in mi sono sentita arrabbiata, sconfitta, senza speranze, triste e impotente... ma alla fine mi ha anche dato speranza, mi ha aiutata ad avere pi prospettiva, ha acceso un fuoco in me e mi ha ispirata ad essere pi attiva e a usare la mia voce per cause in cui credo, anche se significa che devo urlare.

"In May of 2017 I lost my job and insurance benefits from Harley-Davidson of Scottsdale. At that same time I had just finished my Holistic Nutrition program at school. I had learned all about our modern day food industry and how tainted and toxic the food we consume has become (no thanks to large corporations and our government!). I quickly cut out all processed foods, became plant-based, and purged all of my cosmetics and household cleaners that were also filled with chemicals and toxins. Since my medical insurance was gone and since I was intentionally single and not interested anyways, I decided it was time to cut out birth control to see what my body was like without it. I had been on birth control pills since I was 16 years old and then at 26 decided it was time for a break. . Flash forward two years and I finally got a job where medical insurance is available. I essentially pay $100 a month from my paycheck just to get birth control!! Since I have had a period, I have the MOST DISABLING cramps every time. After two years of being off of it and suffering, I wanted to give it another shot after asking my doctor a lot of questions I had never asked before. For years prior I was on a pill called Microgestin Fe. It worked wonders, it didnt make me crazy, I didnt gain weight or get acne, my periods were light and like 4 days long, and the best part was I had no cramps. It is now month 2 of being back on the pill after two years off and the pharmacy at Walgreens told me they did not offer Microgestin anymore. So I switched and went to CVS pharmacy for the first time. However, they pulled a fast one on me apparently and gave me the generic version of Microgestin called Blisovi Fe. Well.... after two months of this I can tell you that I am feeling pretty hopeless. I looked this drug up and found SOOOO MANY WOMEN who are having the same experience as me. The pharm pulls the switch, the doctors swear its the same meds, and the side effects I am experiencing are just the same as these other women. I am ANGRY alllllll the time now.

"For your viewing pleasures... These are the final 3 installments of gallery artist s project for I have been working on this project with MoMA going through their archive and their collection. Im going to be releasing new short videos every few weeks from this series. I wanted to think about the meaning and position of all of MoMAs beautiful things in our time of image saturation and overwhelming choice. My project is loosely inspired by John Bergers seminal 1970s video series Ways of Seeing, updated for our time. Bergers project was a series of four 30-minute videos made for the BBC in 1972 as a reaction to the ways that television and new forms of commodity advertising were using art historical strategies in order to seduce consumers. His work critiqued the ways that images are used by those in power to make their interests seem inevitable or natural, and he demonstrates these power dynamics by looking at advertising, historical painting, and television. In my own project, I am similarly exploring how values and social norms are constructed and reinforced through art historical objects and popular images. The videos connect the power of art history and advertising to new issues around social media, contemporary feminism and the movement, technology and the intensified life of images, and news media and truth in the current moment. I wanted to think about the meaning and position of all of MoMAs beautiful things in our time of image saturation and overwhelming choice.",0,0

"This week we are talking about women's sexual health, as it is an important but very taboo part of women's overall wellbeing. While we normally have no problem talking about sexual health in terms of men, thinking about sexual health for women still seems to require a lot of sensitivity. so before we dive into all that fun stuff, we first need to talk about another important thing women face with their sexual health- slut shaming.     As women, we seem to teeter in this fine line of ""if you're not giving it up you're a prude, but if you are you're a slut"". What about just letting women do their thing safely and happily? Giving women the permission to love themselves in such an intimate manner. How can women truly explore their sexual health if they're too ashamed to talk about it in the first place. We need to empower one another and provide a safe space to talk about sex for women. So this week while we focus on intimacy and sexual health, we also encourage you to look at your own relationship with yourself around your body image, and thoughts of yourself in relation to sexual health. Let's make it okay to learn about sex & intimacy.   ",1,2

This Friday the 18th of October, we go down memory lane to remember the feminist struggles that have existed before us and how they have really remained consistent but also intensified over the past 300 years. To remember the milestones of the Womxn's movement in South Africa, requires us to reflect on how we can take the struggle further in ways that bring about a radical shift in power. We need new ways of organizing, but how do we do that if we don't learn from the past?

Intentions vs perception Its happens often when someones good intentions are perceived in an offensive way. In these situations there is a negative effect for both the perceiver of course but more importantly the one with the good intentions. Without realizing they are going around la la la with the idea they have of themselves not realizing how although they try one way or another to make women feel good about themselves they are going around judging and shaming. They continue to act as they feel right not knowing that the words they spread on or offline negatively affect others. This comment is only one example of what I am referring to. I have sadly experienced this and witnessed this too many times in the past few months and now with this comment I have to say something. This comment alone seems nice and words of wisdom but this same comment attached to a sexual photo changes all meaning. It no longer becomes words of wisdom but more so words of passive aggressive shaming. Those who act this way will never realize unless they are told. The digital world has become a sad place where those promoting women empowerment then shame or question what others versions of it is... . . . . . . . . .,0,0

A cleaner knocks and enters the room. He tells me Im pretty, and I laugh in response. He leaves with the trash. A while later, I venture out the apartment door, wanting to explore and also escape the awkwardness Im experiencing with the crowd.

"The Advertising Standards Authority has banned two TV ads following complaints from the public that they perpetuate harmful stereotypes. One of the ads, which was marketing Philadelphia cream cheese, was accused of reinforcing the idea that men were ineffective childcarers. The other was for Volkswagen and featured a woman sitting next to a pram in a stereotypical care-giving role. The ads were found to have broken new advertising rules designed to reduce gender stereotyping. Both companies have defended their ads. Philadelphia described it as a ""no-win situation,"" having chosen two dads to avoid the stereotypical image of two new mums handling childcare responsibilities, while Volkswagen said caring for a newborn was a life-changing experience, regardless of the parent's gender.

As a person with DID brought on by trauma, there are definitely some things in that shed that some of my parts absolutely DO NOT want to talk about; but going to therapy & doing just that is critical for me to let go, shed that old skin & come out clean, so I can focus on what spirit has planned for me in this new season of my life. What struck me were the similarities of the 2 words; similar, but with different meanings. A shed is a place you store or lock things away for safe keeping. In my case; a mental shed filled with secrets of the abuse I suffered as a child; and 6 of swords represents shedding of skin, old baggage, leaving an old life behind for a new one. Shed;Shedding. Wow. Enjoy your evening lovelies & thank you for listening. Love & light. ",0,0

"My 1940s born parents and culture raised me to believe this. My mom was a virgin when she married my dad at age 22 and very sexually repressed. My dad was a slut. You can imagine what happened in their marriage. My mom was virtually a frigid bitch and my dad had non consensual affairs and *hurt* her. Their 18 year marriage ended when I was 10 and it was traumatic for me and my 2 older siblings. Meanwhile I was still told to wait til marriage or make a guy wait many months to prove and commodize his love to me. My 11yr sexually dead marriage ended in divorce with 3 kids ages 2, 6 and 8. I was then told it was too soon to date and that I should again make the men wait especially at *our age* -- insane. What the hell are we doing as a culture? I took a new path at 39 to do things my way and found my soulmate. We had sex when we wanted to. We eventually healed all our sexual trauma and had a sexual awakening together. After 2 beautiful and foundational monogamous years, we were lead down the path to being open. It's been the medicine for our souls. I WILL NOT participate in this programming anymore, and I'm living it out by example as an ethical slut and as a conscious parent whom will not allow her children to slut shame nor commodize their sexuality. vs. =",1,2

"We had a film session yesterday as part of our new course coming out and we re-enacted a scene to explain how to use our material in a real life situation. We discussed in vivid detail (together and with our videographer) how we wanted the scene portrayed. It started by me walking out of a store to see a man waiting outside, but watching me. This is normal everyday life. But his body language portrayed differently. His arms lowered when we made eye contact and he quickly looked away. I continued walking and then noticed he discarded something from his hands and turned my direction. These are all signs. We had a few suggestions that later in the video when I notice he is following me into the parking lot that I should run or show a scared expression on my face. But I disagreed. Why? Because I'm tired of videos showing women helpless and scared. And although this specific scenario was being acted out, this has happened to me before. I had a man follow me out to my car one time. I was able to avoid anything happening because I had a plan. Was it scary? Yes. Was I shaking? Yes. But I was in control and a potentially dangerous situation was avoided. And that's what I want our material to teach others how to do too.  How to recognize signs.  How to coordinate a plan in a matter of seconds.  How to be in control. Because even if you are only one second ahead of a threat, YOU are still in control.",0,0

"The way our boys are brought up is all wrong. Otherwise how do they get to a point where they behave entitled just because theyre boys  who grow into toxic men? I have so many memories of growing up in a small town in India with three sisters and a bunch of cousins. We had impromptu picnics at the Kharkai river near our house, we stayed up all night after exams to celebrate and commemorate with our little parties, we performed plays for the neighbors, and we had weddings for our dolls, long elaborate ceremonies with so much fun, frolic and festivities. Once, we walked over five miles in the rain and lightning to our aunts house, and her daughter almost had a heart attack seeing us all wet and shivering at her door but, for us, it was an adventure. The world was our oyster and we were nave, bold, unafraid and willing to speak our minds. Our parents were not hovering around us as helicopters either. You are a girl, stay within your limits One summer vacation, we were going out of town in an open jeep with the four of us in the back. It was just our trusted driver and us, our parents were already there (I forget the name of the city but it was somewhere not too far) and we were joining them. A car with three or four young teenage boys who had their windows rolled down started following us and somehow it turned into a race. When we would be in the front we would start singing, aa dekhen zara, kismen kitna hai dum (a Bollywood song which means let us see, who is stronger) and then when they would race ahead we would be badgering our driver Kujur to go faster. It was all meant to be in good fun, and we were happy that we were in the lead. Read more, link in bio",0,0

"Have you ever been treated unfairly because of someone elses unconscious or implicit bias? So many of us have been, and it can be really difficult to know how to react. Many years ago, when I joined the board of The Duke of Edinburghs Award and attended a drinks reception at Buckingham Palace, I put out my hand to introduce myself to my new fellow board member (a white man of a certain age!) and he put his empty coffee cup in my hand and walked away. He presumed I was the waiting staff. I just took the cup, with my mouth hanging open in total shock. I didnt know what to say. I didnt want to come across as some overly sensitive young woman and I didnt want to make a scene. So, I said nothing. I really regret that now as my silence sounded like acceptance. - This is a perfect example of unconscious bias in action. He hadnt even realised what hed done, and he certainly hadnt meant to cause offence. Speaking up is difficult. What if it becomes confrontational? What if I get emotional when I try to explain how their words or actions affected me? Will it make any difference? We have to push past these concerns and speak up anyway because it is the only way to make the unconscious, conscious. So, if you find yourself in a position where you are being treated unfairly or unequally, try one of the three strategies I explain in this video. - Ive also put together a free PDF to help you to walk through the steps of speaking up. You can get it at . Id recommend printing it and stashing it in a notebook or your top drawer at work, just in case! The good news is that the thought of speaking up is always much worse than the reality and, in my experience running the Diversity & Inclusion consultancy MIX, most people are shocked to find that they may have inadvertently hurt you or caused offence and are open to being re-educated. - +",0,0

It is an incredible and eye-opening overview of everything that mainly women have to put up with on a daily basis - from seemingly small and insignificant situations to undeniably unacceptable circumstances. I am proud to say that I am a feminist and am more convinced that ever that every single person can make a difference in this fight for a more just and equal world. By showcasing such a large amount of stories and incredible ways to make them public and deal with them in quick-witted ways, this book strengthened my belief of speaking out when necessary and the need to call out sexist behavior when I encounter it. It clearly demonstrates the importance of noticing, uncovering and appropriately dealing with sexism. As there are so many strong-willed and determined people in this together, some day, sexism and all of its related impacts and repercussions will hopefully be a thing of the past. . . .",0,0

During the dinner Joes + Manon will serve some of the challenges and opportunities within sexuality. As dinner guest you can expect an interactive experience in which the conversation about the topics is facilitated in an original and surprisingly delicious way. The orgasm gap will be cut away, taboos will be spiced up and stereotypes will be made into pulp. The experience dinners show the constructive and positive role of design in debating difficult and intimate subjects. The dinner is designed in close collaboration with Petra Tiemessen, Seksuologen in Sp and Rutgers, the Dutch authority on research & sexuality. Also, we are very happy to collaborate with designers Thieu Custers, Nienke Helder en Circus Engelbregt.",0,0

"I was 19. He was my childhood friend. We started hanging out again after ages. He picked me up to drop me to off to college after having a late lunch at his house. Hey remember the place we use to hike when we were kids, they have a car trail to go up since the place is turning into housing development. Lets go up there since you still have time for your class, he said. I didnt think further, I agreed, blindly believing him. We drove up and parked the car, enjoying the view of the city from the top. Rain started pouring, he said its dangerous to drive down back and to wait till the rain stops. Thats when it started. While we were talking, he started touching me. I pushed his hands away but he kept trying repeatedly more aggressively. At one point, he managed to pin me down and came over me, pushing my dress up. Dont play hard to get he said and that just startled me. I couldnt fight him off anymore, eventually giving in. He sent me to college afterwards, and I pretended like nothing happened. I couldnt sit through the class, and I walked out just sitting by the stairs. I couldnt cry because all I felt was numb. What he said got to me, I started blaming myself for putting myself into a mess. By then Ive gotten used to this and it is saddening to say so. It feels easier to pretend like life was normal so at least I feel like I should live for the next day. READ MORE IN THE LINK ON MY PROFILE .makeup",0,0

"[Women [and men actually, but I didn't draw a guy in the picture] were sexually assaulted by the police in Hong Kong!] Today I'll further talk about the crimes of the Hong Kong police. Maybe some people would think it's okay to be violent to ""rioters""but I'm telling you it's not okay. The police is not like judges in the court, they don't get to punish people whatever they like! Here are some 1. When these cops arrest protestors, they sometimes touch the girls inappropriately. (Many protestors are UNDERAGE girls so I have no idea how many girls they have assaulted...) 2. There was a guy who claimed that he was sexually abused by at least two men when he was captured. (In my culture, men don't usually talk about being sexually abused so personally I think he should be honest.) 3. A girl was wearing a dress but a troop of cops carried her harshly and didn't let her walk. There were cameras everywhere and I bet everyone saw her underwear It was a kind of public shaming. 4. A girl was asked to take off all her clothes in a room. There was a female cop that looked at her sexually. She felt so humiliated. She also realized there were a lot of MALE cops not far from the scene... So they probably heard everything. It was humiliating and public shaming. They didn't do it professionally. 5. A girl was on a bus. A police asked her to take off her WHITE dress. the dress code of the protest is BLACK) The police TOOK PHOTOS OF HER UNDERWEAR. What's the point really?

"Last night Mr Handmade came home from work and got a text asking if he wanted to go out to play to watch the football. I could sense the fear akin to a mouse that knows he's about to become dinner for a bird of prey as he asked if I minded. In my best ""wife to be"" impression I said ""no, of course"". Silently adding on ""you've had a tough old 24 hours at work and I'm sure you're exhausted from me doing the housework, cooking, food shopping, working my own 20 hour a week job, completing Etsy orders and getting up eleventy billion times a night with a poorly 1 year old do so you go out and let your hair down"". I thought it was best that I added that bit silently. Secretly I didn't give two shits because I immediately had visions of a large glass of wine, my feet up, complete silence and control of the tv remote. Happy days. He followed up with ""okay, just wanted to make sure because I'm not sure what your plans for tonight are"". Plans? Me?

"(continued...) 3. Emotional and Verbal this is less known about, when one is physically abused they might try to justify it with narratives that their partner didnt mean it or was just angry, but they know that have been hit, which is tangible. In cases of emotional abuse, the hardest part is for the victim to realize the situation theyre in. This may include but is not limited public humiliation, constant criticism and degrading, threatening to kill the victim or themself, accusing, using reality distorting statements, and neglecting the victims requests and needs. 4. Financial and Economic this may come off as rather obscure too. this controlling family funds and limiting the victims access to money, giving the victim no say in how the money is spent, and stopping the victim from taking a job or causing them to lose it. 5. this is a show of dominant behavior and is possibly the core issue of domestic violence.

" As a society, we need to understand that women can be sexually active and promiscuous without being referred to as sluts. We need to understand that sex work is work, and provide the same rights and protections for sex workers. To understand that consent is something that should be taught to *everyone*. To understand that teaching someone safety tips to avoid being raped just means someone else might be raped instead. To understand that age appropriate sex education (including LGBT education) is the single best way to achieve this. - Alyssa Henley, Alyssa is a polyamorous Trans Liason Officer who joined Scarlet Ladies to meet new people, as well as to explore her interests in gender equality, sex positive feminism, and to tackle the tough issues affecting women in the world today.",0,0

"Consent is sexy. What Consent  Consent means the agreement given to a sexual partner at the moment the partners take part in sexual activities.  This consent must be voluntary. This means that it must be given freely and not forced. Consent must also be informed. Informed means that the person consenting understands the consequences of the decision. If the choice is not free and informed, then the person's consent is not valid.  There is no consent if someone refuses to participate in a sexual activity but is forced into it anyway.  Also, the consent must be clear, and it must be given personally by the person taking part in the sexual activity. Consent based on the words or actions of someone else is not valid.  How Consent Must Be Given  The law doesn't say exactly how consent to sexual activities must be given. It is enough that someone consents through words, through actions or both these ways. Therefore, consent doesn't have to be verbal or in writing.   Now go enjoy some hot consensual sex!        ",0,0

"Something witchy this way comes! The Burning by is a cracking YA read. Juxtaposing the horrifying realities of the Scottish witch trials with the similarly horrifying realities of present-day bullying and slut-shaming, it follows Anna as she relocates to a remote town in Scotland to escape the troubling events of her recent past. Here, she discovers parallels between her situation and the towns history of witch trials.

If we prize outwards appearance over personality or actions, we are not encouraging our girls to have their own unique personality, but rather to be pretty, demure and passive. We teach them that we value their looks above anything else about them. We teach them to create a false self and to people please. Ultimately, we teach them low self-esteem. Why then are we surprised when they start wearing make up and heels at 5, are dieting by 9 and having cosmetic surgery in their teens?

One campaigner, , set up a petition demanding that these offensive remarks be removed. She is asking for all discriminatory language to be altered and for minorities such as trans women to be represented.  But the head of content strategy for the company told that terms won't be removed just because they are seen as derogatory. Instead, it will be made clear that they are offensive.

"People get stuck for a change because they expect everything to be perfect. We want a perfect me, an ideal relationship, perfect sex, an excellent workout, the perfect career. We don't do it because we don't feel good when we do it. We are so afraid to fail. We worry that if we allow imperfection, we will lose our drive. That's not true. That's precisely what keeps us stuck. My breakthrough in morning routines happened when I accept to be imperfect. I got up early in the morning because I decided to change my life. I get up early when I feel still sleepy when the last night I didn't sleep well. I went to the park to exercise, and the weather is not so good. I got seven mosquito bites, and I feel muscle sore because of my monthly period. However, I have never been so grateful in my heart. I start celebrating the beauty and blessings that are disguised in imperfections. I have no regrets for getting mosquito repellent or feeling sore. I aspire to do it better next time, and I still appreciate my present state. This is how I get unstuck. Appreciate wherever you are and whoever you are right now. Do not demand yourself to be perfect. Set no condition for loving yourself while allowing yourself to aspire to be a better version of yourself.

". Living in nyc this summer nearly every day, on the street or the subway, I was harrassed just for being a woman. I would often see other woman get harassed aswell. It's a lose-lose if a woman makes eye contact, or stands up for herself the losers that make women uncomfortable follow you, turn around, cuss you out, spit on you, star even more, try and intimate you even more, the list goes on some even physically assault. If you ignore it, they have the satisfaction that they made you uncomfortable, and will continually think it's okay to harass . What is it with these men who think it's okay to do that? Its literally sickening and nauseating. We are not scared we are fed up! So ya, as vulgar as it is, my hope for this piece is share the discomfort, the nauseating feeling, and the physical discomfort of being harassed based on your anatomy with those who identify with men. It's not about rage, it's to hopefully help men realize what women feel when they get harassed. I do realize men do get harassed as well, but on a whole women are far more likely to experience it regularly. So stop, it if you do. We do not think its flattering for cat calls, you turning around for a double take, the constant staring, ""looking good baby"" ""you should smile"" etc. If you wouldnt say it to your sister or brother then dont.

"DOMESTIC VIOLENCE/ ABUSE AWARENESS MONTH- October The first guy I dated, cheated on me. The first real boyfriend I ever had, played with my emotions so intensely that I would hide myself in my closet crying for days- weeks. His friend raped me in my sleep at his dorm and no one believed me when I reached out for support - actually everyone distanced themselves from me. Most sexual interactions I had were not respectful of my emotions. You got me all riled up, you gave me blue balls, you HAVE to help me now - shit like that. My ex-husband, had a physical/emotional affair on me with my best friend that I brought into my home to support her. This all happened when I was freshly diagnosed - sick, battling my health, struggling to have sex. My ex-boyfriend, made me feel so low that he manipulated me into taking drugs I didnt want. He emotionally abused me to to the point of wanting to commit suicide. I had to run away to get away from the toxicity. He stalked me and broke into my house, chased me down the street and continuously verbally abused me into thinking it was all MY fault for his behaviour. Sexually when Ive said no, these guys think its a game of lets change her mind fun. Ive been called the worst names possible, have had the worst lies spread about me, I have felt ashamed for my sensuality AND sexuality. I have done horrible things to my body as a result of feeling belittled and shamed. Patriarchy has failed us Wombyn. I see it ALL-THE-TIME. How men talk about other Wombyn, how they expect, judge, manipulate just to get sex. When Wombyn do speak up, they are ridiculed and called liars. So yeah... This is only a fraction of my story - but its my truth, and its taken me my whole life to try and heal from. Its a real thing that Wombyn have to go through - most Wombyn deal with but you wouldnt know because its too scary to voice our story.

"This happens to me all the time. I cannot explain all the nuances (working on it) but know enough to know theres something to it. A most recent example would be the following picture. A few months ago I was reading about s latest release at when this specific piece caught my eye. The thought went something like... Wow! Sharp! Id love to get my hands on it. Quick, instantaneous follow up thoughts regarding a good price and potentially flipping it for a small profit followed. A few days later, while waiting to let someone inside a locked door, I felt inspired to check a site I buy watches from. There it was for an incredible price! I purchased it and then sold it a few days later for a fair price. How do I explain the phenomenon? Is it supernatural? Yes, its supernatural but natural... because the supernatural contains, intersects and interacts with the naturalthat just because something is supernatural does not mean it cannot be explained. Do I think God was involved? Of course... if you believe Colossians 1. Maybe its a little bit of Mark too... whatever you ask for, believe that you have received it and it will be yours. Do such realities exist outside of a covenant relationship with the creator? I think so. Which... I know makes a lot of professing Christians uncomfortable but God has never been concerned about patenting or putting a trademark on truththe reality of what is. Its important to remember that whats in sacred scripture is true but not everything that is true is in sacred scripture. Thus, the reality of who God is not dependent upon what can be objectively known and therefore measured. ? Thats ok. Its all by faith. Always has been, always will be. Why does it work for some and not for others? Intention. The invisible spiritual realm reacts and responds most to our intentions because they, our intentions, are who we really are and therefore contain the most reality (power & energy). Once again, though I do not understand it all, this idea makes sense in light of Jesus teaching in Mark 4 in regards to seeds, soil and spiritual returns of 30, 60 & 90 multiples.",0,0

"Fear has turned into power, pain has turned into purpose; thats who I am now. I am Sheela, a child sexual abuse/rape survivor. I am a happier person now, the happiest I have ever been in my life actually. No more self-blaming, done with feeling victimised, and embracing that I have survived through all that so that I can be the change the society needs. This is what I have to say My hymen doesnt define my womanhood. My virginity shouldnt be a tick-off for marriage proposals. I am more than just a sexual being. My choice of lifestyle, my choice of clothing and my existence is not a reason for anyone to sexually abuse me. I will not be blamed for how the society has raised men to see women as sexual tools before anything else. It wasnt my fault and it never will be. I didnt ask for it when I was 5 years old, when I was 14, 19 or 22 years old. But I lived with the guilt because I was afraid of the society. I was afraid of the shame I would bring to my family because of what adult men did to me and I am done with it! I still struggle with anxiety, there are still trigger points that gets to me. I stopped running from them, instead now I just find ways to overcome them. I make conscious choices to not allow those men to be within my life and surrounding. I made my stand because in the end, whether I like it or not, they are my demons to battle and I am ready to fight my grounds. I hope survivors who read this find strength within them to live through their life and find happiness in them. I hope the rest of you play a role to be a better human in this world.

"Today is the 50th Anniversary of Stonewall. In a piece for It is commonly known that started with the 1969 Stonewall Inn Riots against police brutality. What is often left out of this narrative is that it was spearheaded by two transgender sex workers of colorMarsha P. Johnson & Sylvia Rivera. According to the Global Network of Sex Work Projects (NSWP), the Stonewall Inn was commonly raided by the police because it was a notorious hangout for sex workers, trans people of color & other marginalized people.  Following the riot, Johnson & Rivera co-founded the organization Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries, a group dedicated to helping homeless young drag queens & trans women of color. Both of their lives were dedicated to fighting for equal rights through any means necessary.  Although she had spearheaded of the movement, Rivera had to fight to speak during a 1973 pride rally because, as Melinda Chateauvert writes in her book Sex Workers Unite, The crowd did not want to hear from a transgender sex worker. Rivera & other sex workers joined Gay Liberation Front in an attempt to create a coalition of leftist queer folk. GLF fought for the sexual revolution & an anti-capitalist agenda to combat violence & discrimination against the LGBTQ community.  In Prostitution Papers, Kate Millet writes Prostitution, homosexuality & abortion are 3 instances where the law infringed upon sexual freedom.

"with  Posted  All use of animals for food, clothing, entertainment, pets or experimentation involves utilising animals against their will, and - in the vast majority of cases - involves their suffering and deaths. We are brought up to believe in our current society that we need to consume or make use of other animals but this is neither ethical nor necessary. Instead, vegans choose to live a lifestyle that respects other animals as sentient individuals whose lives have meaning and do not consume, wear or use animal products or take part in activities which exploit animals. Today, being vegan is easy, proven to be healthy and needn't cost more. Being vegan is about living a lifestyle that does not cause suffering, harm or death to animals, and allowing animals to be free to choose the way they want to live. Other animals are sentient beings like us, with their own needs, desires and interests. We now know that like us, they can experience a wide range of sensations and emotions such as happiness, pain, pleasure, fear, hunger, sadness, boredom, frustration or contentment. They are aware of the world and what happens to them matters to them. Their lives have intrinsic value - they are not inferior beings nor just here as resources or tools for human use. Discriminating against non-human animals or believing them to be inferior solely because they belong to a different species is known as speciesism and is as unscientific and unjust as racism or sexism.

"Womens sexual liberation should not be about fending off mens sexuality, but rather, about women embracing their own. Its no secret that we need to reset the culture of sexual politics. Women should not be intimidated or coerced into sex. Women should be free to sleep with people because they WANT to, not because they owe them anything, or have been coerced into it, or because they were forced. I can be pro sex and anti rape. The obvious (or should be obvious) difference is explicit consent. Changing rape culture is not about sheltering women and hiding them away from men. It is about changing the culture that allows, or even encourages, rampant sexual assault. Just because a woman is sexually active does not mean she is for the taking. It means she is in control of her own body; she chooses who she fucks. Sex is about both individuals actively choosing to engage in sex, simple as that. So lets hear it for the ladies that love sex.",0,0

"SEXUAL ASSAULT/HARASSMENT/RAPE I was staying with my boyfriend at his parents house for the weekend. Before I went there, I made sure he know that we couldnt have sex as Id just had a cervical examination and biopsy a few days before. He reassured me that he was okay about it. On the night I got there, we were downstairs watching a movie and he tried to have sex with me so I reminded him we couldnt; so he started pushing me to give him a blowjob but I said I didnt feel comfortable doing that on the couch in his parents living room! When we went upstairs he put candles around his bedroom and said he wanted to give me a massage which I thought was sweet. But I had to be naked. While he was massaging my back he kept pulling my bum upwards and I kept telling him no we cant have sex. This happened a few times and I kept telling him to stop it and dont you dare put it in. But he did. It was only for a few seconds until I managed to jump away from him. Afterwards, I felt stupid that I let my boyfriend massage me naked -did I let this happen? Was it my fault? But the truth is I trusted him right up until the moment it happened. It took me 6 months to come to terms with what happened and say out loud that he raped me.",0,0

"From the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters who broke the news of Harvey Weinstein's sexual harassment and abuse for the New York Times, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the thrilling untold story of their investigation and its consequences for the movement For many years, reporters had tried to get to the truth about Harvey Weinsteins treatment of women. Rumors of wrongdoing had long circulated. But in 2017, when Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey began their investigation into the prominent Hollywood producer for the New York Times, his name was still synonymous with power. During months of confidential interviews with top actresses, former Weinstein employees, and other sources, many disturbing and long-buried allegations were unearthed, and a web of onerous secret payouts and nondisclosure agreements was revealed. These shadowy settlements had long been used to hide sexual harassment and abuse, but with a breakthrough reporting technique Kantor and Twohey helped to expose it. But Weinstein had evaded scrutiny in the past, and he was not going down without a fight; he employed a team of high-profile lawyers, private investigators, and other allies to thwart the investigation. When Kantor and Twohey were finally able to convince some sources to go on the record, a dramatic final showdown between Weinstein and the New York Times was set in motion. Nothing could have prepared Kantor and Twohey for what followed the publication of their initial Weinstein story on October 5, 2017. Within days, a veritable Pandoras box of sexual harassment and abuse was opened. Women all over the world came forward with their own traumatic stories. Over the next twelve months, hundreds of men from every walk of life and industry were outed following allegations of wrongdoing. But did too much changeor not enough?",0,0

"Society grants privilege to people because of certain aspects of their identity. Aspects of a persons identity can include race, class, gender, sexual orientation, language, geographical location, ability, and religion, to name a few. I feel a responsibility to use my privilege to promote equity for all. My voice may carry significant weight within certain groups where people may hear the message differently. When I recognize my own privilege and practice empathy and awareness for those that do not share the same, I am able to experience a humility that is fulfilling and creates gratitude for the opportunities that I have been afforded. It is important for us to acknowledge privilege in order to challenge social inequities that keep many from finding success in their lives. Gender equity is something I feel very passionate about creating and is why I work with Next Gen Men to facilitate monthly meetings to hold space for conversations that may not be happening around masculinity and gender and how it impacts us all. These are open to all regardless of how they identify and are such rich conversations for all who attend, including myself. The social inequity that currently exists can keep people stuck stifle us to live our best lives. This may be through social norms, gender norms, or even expectations transferred to us from family and friends. I am now lucky enough to have people seek me out to be a part of their journey toward becoming mentally healthy and enjoying mental wellness. A rising tide lifts all boats. By raising opportunity and striving for gender equity for all around us, we are creating a stronger, healthier, and more equitable society to learn from each other and experience the best life possible.",1,2
"Women don't experience discrimination anymore Theres no doubt that womens role in the workplace has come a long way, but lets not overestimate the progress weve made. The good news is that theres now a relatively high awareness of blatant forms of sexism, meaning that this overtly discriminatory behaviour has reduced dramatically. However, bias against women is still very real in the form of micro-equities. While these may seem small, their impact can be very significant, wholly undermining the individual on the receiving end. They are subtle, often unconscious, messages that devalue, discourage and impair workplace performance, showing that women *do* still experience discrimination.",1,1

We all have coping mechanisms, and the things mentioned in the post are part of our way of feeling safe. Safety is crucial for our wellbeing.

"Have you ever searched online for the definition of a woman? Besom, piece, bit, bitch, mare, baggage, wench, petticoat, frail, bird, bint, biddy, filly  These are the words which the Oxford online dictionary tell us mean the same as woman.  These definitions show an appalling level of sexism that is totally unacceptable in todays society. It must change. Maria Beatrice Giovanardi works at a womens rights startup, and while looking to rebrand she started searching for synonyms of the word woman online. She had no idea that this search would reveal such extreme misogyny. And as if this wasnt bad enough, under the definition of woman the Oxford Dictionary gives the following Ms September will embody the professional, intelligent yet sexy career woman; If that does not work, they can become women of the streets; male fisherfolk who take their catch home for the little woman to gut; I told you to be home when I get home, little woman. These examples show women as sex objects, subordinate, and/or an irritation to men. As well as all this, the definition of a man is much more exhaustive than that of a woman - with 25 examples for men, compared to only 5 for women.  This is completely unacceptable by a reputable source like the Oxford University Press, but its even more worrying when you consider how much influence they have in setting norms around our language. These misogynistic definitions have become widespread because search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo license the use of the Oxford English Dictionary for their definitions. This is incredibly concerning because it can influence the way that women are spoken about online. Should an institution like the Oxford University Press portray women this way? What message does this send to young girls about their identity and expectations for the future? If we want to create an equal society, we need language fit for the 21st century that doesnt discriminate against women. Oxford Dictionarys team are defining who women are and doing it in a very outdated manner which denigrates women.  Please sign (Link in bio) & share the petition to address this ridiculousness!",1,1

"A post on a popular saree group on how girls should dress demurely to stay safe, caused my blood to boil yesterday. A large number of women had expressed their regressive views on how if a woman is not modest her character is suspect and so on. Every one of the commentators believed they had the right to comment on what a woman should or shouldn't do because they ""cared"" about her and her safety. The only point everyone seemed to agree on is that society needs to change. But I believe society will change when women change. So, every time you make a little girl feel that she must yield something to her brother ""kyon ki wo ladka hai"" (he is a boy), society won't change. Everytime you ask a boy what he wants to be when he grows up and tell the girl that she has to simply wait for a ""Sapnon ka Rajkumar"" (Prince Charming) , society won't change. Everytime you buy a girl pink dresses with frills and tiaras and call her pari/princess and buy her dolls without letting her choose her favourite colour or toy from a range of options, society won't change. Everytime you ask a girl aged 5 if she has a boyfriend and not how she did in class, society won't change. Everytime you tell a girl that her father must approve of her choices and decisions because his is the last word in the family, society won't change. Everytime you define a woman as someone's mother, daughter or sister, and not as an individual, society won't change. Everytime you tell her to ""adjust"" in a bad marriage because ""log kya kahenge"" (what will people say), society won't change. So you see, before we blame the boys, ask if we raised them right. Or whether the fault lies with us!? In a khadi jamdani by the inimitable .manasghorai, which is christened Kalkha, where different butas unite in their diversity.

"This is for you who handed me a collection of tears and passionate screams that wrapped me around your phallus instead of your heart, and broke me down to the morsel of your soul. This is for you who used his smile and charm to draw me into a friendship that allow me to trust you with all that I have. You are the scum that women over generation warned me about and I still chose you to prove them wrong. when I looked into you eyes I swear I saw the universe and believed you could create mine. MY MIND WAS NO LONGER MY OWN NOR WAS MY LIFE. I handed it all to you because you promised me a life with you. With the world in front of me how could I possibly know that you were an enigma sent to break me? I handed you my life you returned an empty soul and a broken heart. if you taught me anything was to always make sure that life works for you, so here it is.. I love you, -for ripping the weakness from my soul. -for making me see that i cannot hand out my heart to anyone unless they are exceptional. -for making me see my own beauty instead of handing it over to the eyes of a stranger. now I don't want you to be confused. You were merely the catalyst for me to become stronger. I don't want you back in my life in any form that I previously took. so, my dearest lover I hope that almighty takes pity on your next conquest and I hope she is strong enough to SURVIVE YOUR GAME. . . . . . . . .",0,0

"Sexual dignity- As a young girl I always thought judging women for their sexual antics was wrong. I was brought up positively about sex and wondered why could men enjoy it and not get any stigma? Whilst women get called Slags, Whores, Hoes, Etc. Later whilst turning into a woman Ive had many discussions with people about self respect and if you have self respect as a woman if you explore your sexuality. No one decides if you have self respect other than yourself. Does your sexual antics define you? Have you lost your dignity if youve slept with a high number of people? Absolutely not. No one can comment on your dignity but yourself. Life is short and sexual pleasure is one of lifes natural beauties.. so you do you hun. L x",1,1

She and her mum flee to Scotland and start again with new names. But the pictures follow Anna to her new school - where she also feels drawn to another young girl, a couple of centuries earlier, who was burnt at the stake for being pregnant out of wedlock. Bates cleverly draws parallels between the two incidents and shocks us into thinking about this modern phenomenon as not a new one at all. Excellent book.",0,0

"A Girl Called Shameless is the sequel to ""The Exact Opposite Of Okay,"" written by Laura Steven. These books follow the protagonist, Izzy O'Neill through dealing with a nationalised sex scandal, along with her friends Ajita and Danny, and her grandmother Betty. ""A Girl Called Shameless"" focuses on Izzy's struggle with figuring out what to do with her life, helping her best friends coming to terms with their sexuality and taking a stand against the cruel slut-shaming endured by both Izzy and another girl whose photos have been leaked. The book deals with subjects that are often considered taboo- Sexual harassment in politics, stereotypes, slut-shaming, the effects of poverty and coming to terms with one's sexuality. The book also deals with the pain centred around slut-shaming, with empathy and statistics. I really did enjoy reading ""A girl called Shameless,"" although I enjoyed ""The Exact Opposite Of Okay"" quite a bit more. Please check it out! Rating TAGS",0,0

"Good rising beautiful people , I am so delighted to finally be letting you all in on the loop of this new project that Ive been working on . After many years of doubting and questioning myself, Ive decided to plunge in and follow my true calling . What is it ? The word Libikisi derives from my native language Lingala which translates to ; HEALING . The main goal of Centre Libikisi is to create a safe space to aid individuals that have gone trough any form of rape or sexual assault on their healing journey by creating a safe space that allows one to freely explore the different aspect of what healing may entail according to them . I believe that healing is individualistic but may require collective efforts from everyone . Being a survivor of sexual assault has allowed for me to see the flaws in the system in which that is meant to protect us aka our education from home . Often times , survivors are looked as the blame and allys that come with good intentions lack the basic knowledge and training of How to go about it effectively .

"WE BROKE UP AND EVERYTHING SUCKS! . Heartbreak can feel like your world is crashing down. Here's how to deal with 1. Talk! Share your feelings with a close friend or somebody that cares about you. 2. Be loved! Surround yourself with people who love you, and let them lift you up! 3. Unfollow! Out of sight, out of mind. Yeah, you might look a little petty, but the less you see what your ex is up to, the easier healing becomes. You can always follow them back after you feel better! 4. Live! Life goes on! The easiest way to move on, it to keep living your life the way you always too (minus your crappy ex!) 5. Keep busy! Take up a new hobby. Make a new friend. Start a new project. 6. Time!

"*Same bandana 5 years apart* Like many others I used to be insecure about parts of my body. Whether that be due to media messaging or internal dysphoria it certainly caused me to dress a certain way. This way was generally covered up. Always wearing jeans and baggy t shirts. While I was dressing this way due to insecurities others were validating me for it, ""you don't dress like other girls"" and ""you look like one of the guys"" were said to me in ways of positive reinforcement while putting down others, predominantly girls, who dressed however they'd like. Once i got passed my own body issues I also had to confront the paranoia now set in me that people would perceive me certain ways based on how I dressed, and the fear that came along with how they might act based on that. I clearly love style now, and dressing however I like means a lot to me, but we need to work on actively changing the culture that allows these comments to be made about ones own style choices in the first place whether they are showing lots of skin or not.",0,0

"Rp MEAT IS MURDER  . Just some pink puppers playing in the water - Take this opportunity to reflect, and please ask yourself, ""Why do most of us believe it's okay to eat pigs, chickens, and cows, but not dogs and cats?"" All of these animals are sentient beings. All of these animals have emotions and feelings. And, most importantly, all of these animals want to be alive.  When we're new to the world and see farm animals for the first time, our initial instinct isn't to eat them; it's to pet them. Only through the repetitive teaching to view some animals as ""companion"" animals and others as ""food"" animals do we separate pigs, chickens, and cows from dogs and cats. This idea that some animals' lives matter more than others becomes engrained into our brains, but we can unlearn it if we try.  ""The idea that some lives matter less is the root of all that's wrong with the world."" -Paul Farmer -",0,0
"**POSSIBLE TRIGGER** * This body has carried me through almost 33 years of life. This body has had food restricted even after only 9 short years of life and experienced celebration only when it became smaller. This body has heard that it is too big, unhealthy, lazy, not feminine, not worthy of love and attention by voices around it that were meant to nurture, support and be trusted. This body began to echo those voices until it believed it had no place in this world until it was small enough.  This body has experienced sexual violence. This body has witnessed and felt the hands of physical violence inflicted upon it sometimes even at it's own hands. This body has carried me through all the while being at war with it's own mind.   This body has been fed poison in the form of many escape drugs. Drugs numbed the mind of this body. It was once again praised for becoming smaller even at the hands of drug addiction the outside voices further instilled that it was better smaller no matter the cost. This body caused pain. This body continued to carry me, my mind had given up. There was no tunnel there was no light. This body got pregnant. This body felt pain like no other. It fought and this body got clean. A life grew inside this body and it saved me. It now had a purpose it was a Mum. Then there was a deep dark hole Postnatal Depression my body still carried me. This body carried me when my mind was not strong enough to escape while being bruised and raped at the hands of the other body that helped create the very thing that saved me. This body was a shell. This body carried me and it's daughter to saftey and has provided a life full of love for the both of us. This body found love. It heard words of it's beauty and acceptance, it felt hands of love not violence. This body has carried babies and lost them. Felt the lasting sting of being unable to create more life whilst at the same time being filled with contentment and love for the one life it did create. It has carried me through chronic pain and illness. Struggled through addiction of different varieties on countless occassions. . . *continues in comments*",0,0

"(link in description) ""I Remember"" by Iz Harris . Blur, shout, in and out Shame on shame, self doubt She Misremembered, Tears hot as embers, Sure as sure gets But wholl defend her? Short skirts, tight shirts, laced drinks, deceiving winks Placing blame, endorsing shame So that's her name, lets counterclaim He was young, they say, boys will be boys Its all fun and games women are toys And you, yes you. I know these words hurt. Stay with me. Do you hear? Now let me be clear. Are you wracked with pain? Riddled with shame? Shout out your name, make your claim. me too, me too, me too START FIGHTING. No more hiding, fears subsiding Unclear, slight fear Notable distress The absence of yes True powerlessness Its a stare too invasive an unwanted hand An assumption of interest and then a command a grope, a text, behavior unchecked One blip in their lives, but lasting effect Wheres the rule book? the guide? How else can we abide? If youre asking, listen here No book will teach you fear No rule will stop your harm No training can disarm Decency, respect we dont need to define. These monsters all know when theyve crossed a line. Is it that hard to ask what we want Not assume, nonchalant Does it take a savant? is it so hard to scream and be heard Caged like a bird Is change so absurd? Is it that hard to breathe in and breathe out? Not push, nor shout To pause enroute? I ask because Im tired, tired of being scared Tired of disappointment, tired beyond repair I ask because I see it, across and in between Callousness and rage, demanding to be seen So tell me, please explain, is it that hard? To remain humane To show refrain To cause no alarm To live and not harm And if its so easy then why do I hear The cries among us, the trembling fear Tell me, if its so easy, why do you hurt? For healing and progress it only subverts. Your actions have meaning, the words that you spew Fast forward, forgotten it may be for you I remember, we remember, your harm wasnt lost Was it worth it, I ask you, as you measure the cost? And you, yes you. I know these words hurt. Stay with me. Do you hear? Now let me be clear. (1/2)",0,0

"The first feminist man I knew was my father. I grew up the youngest of four, two of which are boys. I shared a room with my brothers on and off  until I was 22.   As a kid, I knew no difference between my brothers and I.  My father would sit me down next to the car as he was working, teaching me everything he would my brothers.   He taught me to drive big boats, fix things on cars, fish, and navigate charts.   He taught me I had a right to understand the machinists He taught I had a right to fight for justice.  I was 21 I went through a relationship, and breakup that left me hollow.  I didn't know my worth yet. I didn't know how to navigate my body  to listen for when its time to leave.  My fears where so loud, crushing my intuition.  Id wind up at his house post breakup, waking to my skin covered in shame moulded with regret.   Slowly shaving pieces of the self worth I had left.  I called  My father  Please pick me up.  Hed come scoop me up into his car. Holding space while his baby girl crumbled to dust in the passenger seat. Id eventually settle from a hurricane, to a looming thunder.  Thats when he would look at me straight in the eyes saying,  I know honey, it hurts like you couldn't image. I know.  Unjudged, not shamed, simply understood.  When Im asked, or better yet told.  there are good ones out there. not all men are bad or my personal favourite,  Your just a broken hearted girl who's had a bad experience with men, a disgrace the word feminist   No, Im a woman who knows exactly what a strong feminist man looks like.

"tw; child gr**ming. i wasn't touched but child grooming is s*xual assault. i wont be saying his name. a little over a year ago i met some people which i wont be saying their names but one of them is/was close friends with a cosplayer named dylan emory/leve. this person wasn't inappropriate from the start, but i was more of a slow type of thing. but one day he was flirting with me, he was 18 and i was 15. i didnt know if i liked him or not, but i know he was older and wiser and i kinda looked up to him. but at first it was softer, like a little wholesome meme or a comment on how i looked cute. then the comments got a little more gross, i didnt enjoy it and i told him that. but he continued, i felt uncomfortable but he insisted it was nothing. they slowly got worse, until one night he asked those type of photos. i didnt want to, i dont really take those type of photos. i felt like i had to, he slowly manipulated me into sending something. i had a horrible eating disorder at the time, i even told him and he didnt care. i starved so much, i was tired of my body and he didnt even care. he some how got me to send some things copious times and i felt worse each time. he got more sexual, and we started sexting, it got daily and i felt disgusted. i just wanted to have something sweet, i didnt want this. this made me feel like an object, i was a fucking child. i shouldnt be sexting a grown man. he forced me to delete all the messages afterwards, so there was little proof left but i did post the screenshots i do have. so i tried to ask for help, i didnt know how. i just told one of his friends, i thought hed cut me and the guys thing off, it was a child and a grown man. i just wanted out of it, but i did like some other people around/in their friend group. i told the guy that i didnt like him cause i felt uncomfortable with the age gap and he got mad and called me a f*ggot and a r*tard. he was pissy and i didnt know what to say. i just wanted out, so i decided to post a comment about dylan sh*t talking him and i didnt even hate him i just didnt know him. i got kicked out of the discord, and i was so glad. i just wanted out.",0,0

"Hi, I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse. For most of my adult life, I focused on being right, doing the proper things, knowing what to say. I did my best to bury my ugly bits, because who would love me in my ugly?  And then I started to come undone a year ago. I immediately reached out for therapy. I was trying to save myself, but unraveling more each day. So I thought, let me reach out to my friends. - I have some amazing friends. But one wasnt so amazing when I told him about what happened to me. I even asked him for support, since therapy taught me to ask for what I need. He told me that he couldnt. I havent learned how to accept and respect his no. In my survivors arrogance, I thought he would understand and support me. So I pushed. He pushed back.  I felt like I wasnt good enough to be his friend. Tears are rolling down my cheeks as I type this, because I discovered many things about myself, but one of the saddest things is that I never thought I was good enough for anything. I am working on it. Some days are easier than others.  I was so focused on this one person, that I did not appreciate all the amazing friends I had. The ones who called me, the ones who visited me, the beautiful soul who invited me to her beach house in FL, the text encouragement when I was anxious. The people who understood that my trauma was driving my behavior, and by giving me compassion, showed me how to give myself compassion. That I had a right to be needy. That it was ok to make mistakes. That I was fine just the way I am. Im not perfect, its ok not to be perfect. - So this post resonated with me. I blamed myself for the dissolution of our friendship. But it was never about me. It was about him, and something he could not give me. It is a bittersweet lesson, something many survivors of sexual abuse learn. It takes a long time to learn it, because healing is a process. ",0,0
"The maiden/whore dichotomy is alive and thriving, and although this quote was said with good intentions by someone who felt protective towards me it is actually infantilising and misogynistic. I believe we will have a hard time achieving equality until the population at large, men and women, can allow women to be more sexually free without feeling that it makes her less ""wholesome"", trustworthy, or just less worthy of respect. (Men experience this too, for example in terms of not being able to be vulnerable/sad etc. We're all suffering from the narrow ideas of what an ideal man or woman is should be like) One of the things I loved about discovering BDSM was that a lot of people doing it seem to have managed to remove themselves more from this damaging dichotomy.. I learned that sexual turn ons and acts can be just that and does not say anything about how I should be treated or thought about in a non-sexual setting. I am learning to explore many different sides of my personality, seeing them all as a valuable part of a complex whole. By Sophia",0,0

"I went on a date with this tosser a year or so ago. We met for drinks and he rudely quizzed me on what I did for work etc. I politely tried to converse but he would talk over me and make anti-female jabs almost every time I spoke. He said he didnt respect working women and they should be home in the kitchen. He grilled me on who my employer was and I refused to tell him bc he refused to tell me anything about himself. I attempted to make conversation back and forth, but he basically was like, Im asking the questions and you are not allowed to know anything about me. I was wearing a v-neck shirt and he stuck his hand down my shirt and brushed his hands across my breasts bc he claimed I had a string on my shirt and he was just trying to pull it off (hes a liar- Im ocd about this shit and even keep a pair of scissors in my purse!) I was in too much shock to react- I wanted to punch his face in but I kind of nervously brushed his hand off, scooted away and leaned away from him. Had this happened now, I wouldve attacked him, Ive grown a lot stronger over this past year. He went on about how women are awful creatures and shouldnt have any rights. I quietly sipped my wine bc I knew if I reacted I wouldve punched him in the nuts. He excused himself to go to the bathroom, and I ran up to the bar, paid my tab and ran the hell out of there. This man is a complete narcissistic asshole and probably a woman abuser. He was entirely condescending and attempted to gaslight me for the duration of an hour, not to mention the sexual assault. People wonder why I hate dating... And no, this wasnt his profile back then, I never wouldve swiped on it, it just popped up on my feed today and knew I had to screenshot that shit and speak up. Fuck you JUSTIN. . . .",1,2

"We leant in... but did it fail us? I was one of a generation of women who devoured Lean In (and other similar literature). I embraced the ethos. I joined the circles. I didnt lean out before I had leant in. As per Sandbergs advice, I didnt think about how having children would impact my career. Im my employer is a great support for working parents. But for so many, this isnt the case. Many parents (particularly mothers) look to workplaces for flexibility, be that part-time work, the ability to leave early, or working from home. But in so many traditionally male-dominated industries  those which Sandberg encouraged women to lean into  theres a reluctance to cater to those requests. Or if flexible working is accepted, its often offered begrudgingly and frowned upon behind the scenes. Compare this to stereotypical female professions, where employers are much more open to flexible working. This means mothers are more likely to want to  and feel that they are able to  stay in their career, and progress while having a young family. On the flip side, women in inflexible industries/companies seem to face one of two choices. The first is to accept full-time work and outsource fine if thats what you want, but research shows that many mothers dont, especially when their partner also works full-time. There are a multitude of studies on the negative impact of this forced choice on womens mental health and stress levels. The second choice is to take time out, or to find a flexible alternative elsewhere, both of which tend to negatively limit future earning potential. These women often end up forcibly leaning out more than women who had considered the impact of children on their career pre-pregnancy. This isnt how it should be, but how it is (depressingly). Its what campaigns like aim to address (hurrah!). But with so many employers so stuck in the past, is the reality that without thinking about leaning out, many women have jeopardised themselves? Would planning for the impact of a family and being realistic about the state of todays workplace allow women to navigate long-term career prospects more effectively?",1,1

"What If No One Loves Me After They Find Out Who I Really Am? Half Angel Half Wh*re - Yes Equal Parts But is that what it means to be sexual as a woman? If you are openly sexual as a woman what label do you get? Which star will they make you wear and which fate will that determine? As a man, if youre not strong enough if youre not man enough and if you dont f*ck enough, provide enough, where does society place you? So here we are at this crossroads, both on different sides yet standing at the same junction. Empowering yourself is not easy, especially when it feels like there is an ongoing witch hunt and please dont kid yourselves, THERE IS. Every single person reading this has a quality has something about them that society probably disapproves of or that you believe society disapproves of and that is the exact thing that is keeping you from moving forward. When you come out as owning and loving who you are it can be one of the most terrifying things that you do and yet it is the only way to open the cage... It is the only way to take back your power... You see people creates these places of shame to keep you fearful and to keep you small. They create these ideas so that the have something else to focus on instead of rising up, speaking up and starting a revolution. But dont worry my loves, I see you, I feel you, I hear you and you are in good company.  So whoever YOU are, I want you to know that all of you is beautiful, all of you is welcome here and all of you is worth fighting for and owning. So much love, The Awakened Aphrodite x",0,0

"Ive been in bed since Monday and have had a lot of time to think about things. So now I have some shit to say- 1. We cant pretend to be having and conversations if were not addressing the fact that the large majority of women in this country still work for someone else. Your hashtags are cute and all but they dont do jackshit for the 75 million ladies who dont have control of their own schedules. (according to 2018 statistics bc a bitch in bed has nothing but google) 2. We just came off a holiday weekend and I have the flu. I called my clients to reschedule appointments. If Im being real, I was also a little scared to call out because I worried theyd think I was just extending my vaycay. Thats what 15 years in will do for ya. In fact, one of my best friends WAS FIRED for calling in sick the day after a holiday weekend, so I know just how detrimental 1 sick day can be. 3. Not every woman CAN or even WANTS TO work for herself. Remember that when youre pushing the mindset. 4. Pre-K pickup times ARE BULLSHIT. These pickups are really killing my productivity and Im lucky enough to set my own schedule. For those who are required to be at work during set hours, theyre impossible. The effect? Women are often forced to stay home with their children for an additional year, causing further setback in their careers. Those who return to work often do so at an entry-level salary. Otherwise, 25% of women in the US return to work within 2 weeks of giving birth because they cant afford the UNPAID leave. Its time to overhaul our work culture in this country. Its time for employers to start treating their staff AS HUMANS + accept that we all get sick, have lives to which we must tend, and above all, we are the backbone of this country. Women arent expected to raise the kids, make the meals, and tend to our homes anymore. Were expected to do ALL THAT + contribute financially. If the crusaders of knew how all this would play out, theyd be disgusted. We have to do better.",1,1

"Warning! This caption/rant contains naughty words.  Ive seen this post probably ten times in the last week and it is annoying the shit out of me. When someone posts something like this they assume it shows that they are more evolved and are doing the right thing. What it actually shows is that they are a judgmental piece of work.   So what if someone is hoeing around. As long as they are safe and honest with their partners about their intentions, why should we care? It is 2019. I thought we had begun to move past all this judgmental sex shit. If someone wants to go around and fuck half the eastern seaboard what gives us the right to judge them? And whos to say that they arent also healing at the same time? Speaking of healing, arent we supposed to be focused on that instead of paying attention to what everyone else is doing?  A major step in healing post-divorce is taking a hard look in the mirror. Now, I am not talking about extreme examples. Yes, I am aware that there is abuse and stuff like that. But most marriages fail because of two people, not one. Judgmental posts like this make me wonder if the poster has bothered to take a real look at themselves.  Go ahead and judge. Keep pointing your finger. But be prepared and accept that people will point it back at you - and this is exactly what Im doing now. The world needs more acceptance, not judgment. Focus on healing and stay in your own lane.  ",0,0

QueenV Throughout my life I have had a series of sexual fantasies. Most I learned about through watching porn My ex-husband (married for 28 years) wasnt very sexually confident - so although we watched a little porn together - he wasnt a fax of sexual exploration So sex consisted of mostly in the bedroom and mostly in the morning - two times a week. He felt this was sufficient - I was sexually frustrated for at least two decades So - when I left - I swore - no more. No more living my life by someones standards - no more having unfulfilled fantasies - no more sexually average So thats how I met Chris - a one-night stand who immediately challenged and accepted my sexual fantasies - no matter how perverse my ex told me they were So now we sexually explore both our fantasies - together and with others (sometimes lots of others ) We no longer have fantasies that we dream about - we have fantasies to set goals - sexual experiences to have and to share Its time to question your limiting beliefs about sex - increase your sexual confident and break the chains of sexual boredom.

"The phenomenon of female anger has often been turned against itself, the figure of the angry woman reframed as threat  not the one who has been harmed, but the one bent on harming. She conjures a lineage of threatening the harpy and her talons, the witch and her spells, the medusa and her writhing locks.[] If an angry woman makes people uneasy, then her more palatable counterpart, the sad woman, summons sympathy more readily. She often looks beautiful in her ennobled, transfigured, elegant. Angry women are messier. Their pain threatens to cause more collateral damage. Its as if the prospect of a womans anger harming other people threatens to rob her of the social capital she has gained by being wronged. We are most comfortable with female anger when it promises to regulate itself, to refrain from recklessness, to stay civilized.  Leslie Jamison, I Used to Insist I Didnt Get Angry. Not Anymore.

"Birds and butterflies have been communicating with me quite a bit recently. I grew up enduring a lot of emotional, physical, sexual abuse and rape. I learned to see a lot of negative things about me and the world. And thats how I was creating my life since then. I was struggling with PTSD the last 4 years. Last year, I came across Louise Hay on YouTube. Then Abraham Hicks. At first I was just listening. Then I started to understand. Now Im believing. The flashbacks/intrusive thoughts/negative thought habits had taken control of me. Im 34 now. For the first time in my life, Im in control. Im in control of how I feel now. Im no longer blaming anyone including my Mom, one of my abusers, because I now know that we are all doing the best we can with what we have from where we are at any time. I was walking one of my dogs today, and directly on my path, this bird transitioned. My first thought was superstition. OMG, a bad omen. Then I was like, thank you for sharing. Thats an old thought habit of fear. I choose to believe that everything is working out for me. That I am safe in the Universe and all life loves and supports me. Then I came home and found this video. It helped me realize, the bird is a symbol of the end of my dwelling and mourning of the past. And its my time now. Ive paid the price. Ive put enough in my vortex that I can just chill now. Chill, appreciate, follow my impulses, and amend along the way. Because as we all know, we can never get it wrong and its never done. Thank you.",0,0

"NEWS OF THE DAY  Almost 30,000 people have signed a petition to change the definition of the word 'woman' in the Oxford Dictionary of English and its thesaurus companion.  The two resources reflect everyday language use, but still state that ""bitch"", ""baggage"", ""frail"" and ""piece"" mean the same as ""woman"". Online examples of the definition of ""woman"" include ""I told you to be home when I get home, little woman"" and ""Ms September will embody the professional, intelligent yet sexy career woman.""  One campaigner, , set up a petition demanding that these offensive remarks be removed. She is asking for all discriminatory language to be altered and for minorities such as trans women to be represented.  But the head of content strategy for the company told that terms won't be removed just because they are seen as derogatory. Instead, it will be made clear that they are offensive. Many women will agree that this isn't good enough. Women are not the property of men and deserve more than an oppressed definition.",0,0

"Another one. Apparently this is a super difficult concept, so lets go over 1. Women can wear whatever the f*** we want! 2. Rape is NEVER a victims fault.

It is nothing but a misogynistic idea to force women to be a certain way or ""face the consequences"". 4. Women are allowed to be sexually liberated. Having a lot of sex does not mean I deserve rape anymore than the virgin next door. Stop slut-shaming!!! This is classic rape culture. You are blaming victims, and telling rapists it is ok to rape the woman in the short skirt, because ""its her fault"". You are the reason women are not believed. Why we are mocked, blamed, and shamed. You are a misogynist for trying to take away our choices. We can dress how we want. We can dance. We can have family time. We can interact with men (because there are actually men who are not going to jump me for wearing a crop top).

"Growing I've never realized the amount of lead females in many of the miyazaki movies. As I grew older and was molded by my toxic sexist culture, i grew to despise femininity. This happened despite living with a majority female household and having more genuine friendships with the opposite sex than my male counterparts. This is a way of thinking I'm still trying to redact. Its statically proven that empowering women can empower whole nations.   Many of my movies have strong female leads- brave, self-sufficient girls that dont think twice about fighting for what they believe in with all their heart. Theyll need a friend, or a supporter, but never a savior. Any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man. - Hayao Miyazaki",1,1

"Yep, this is my butt. A part of my body.  Recently I walked into a coffee shop with my partner, following a sweaty workout together on a beautiful fall morning in Ontario. I was wearing Lululemon pants, a long sleeve shirt and sneakers. As we waited to scoop our coffees and head off to vote, a group of 7 men who I assume were in their late 60s, early 70s sat at a table behind me. Unknowingly to me, they sat their looking, pointing and talking about my back side. I watched as my partners eyes grew and his fists tightened. And he said something to this group of men, and one responded with, what, youve never looked at a womens ass? and what, are you Christian?  As I moved aside so my butt wasnt facing them, I looked one man in his eyes and I felt a subtle feeling of disappointment, but not anger. I wasnt feeling my blood pumping like my partner was, and it hit me, this has happened many, many times in my life (and to women I know). I have had to navigate the feeling and real-ness of being objectified. And it has been from both men and women. It has been when Im out dancing. It has been when Im at work. It has been when Im pumping gas. It has been when Im standing in line at a coffee shop.  So, as I sit here thinking of what I would or should have said to those 7 men at the coffee shop, it wouldnt be to scold them or tell them they were being gross, as Im sure it would only be met with resistance and defence. It would be to introduce myself as Kate. Im a daughter, sister, cousin, niece, partner, granddaughter, friend, teacher, cancer survivor, nature lover and soon to be dog mom. And I would let them know that they are making me feel uncomfortable. Yeah, I feel uncomfortable when you stare and make conversation about my ass.  I know those group of men will probably never see this writing, but I feel strongly about raising the consciousness and awareness on such things. I used to shy away from the movement because, well, its hard to look at, its hard to process, and its hard to share my personal experiences. Although this is yet one small distasteful and degrading experience, it serves as another reminder that using my voice is needed. ",0,0

"Betrayal is a beast of an emotion. It's birthed from a place of self hatred and self deception. To be betrayed by those closest to you is the deepest pain that anyone can experience in my opinion. It's a new day in a new space and I see the light, I am the light. One of the biggest lessons I'm learning to realize more and more through this process is that we all live in our own dream we all have demons to face within ourselves, betrayal of another only exposes what is in that person's heart. It's a heart that needs to be fixed, mended and restored. On your journey to recovery don't judge your feelings, allow yourself to feel the pain, the hurt the betrayal, this is the way to release it and let it go. The process is daily.

""That we should have to wait so long and fight so hard for answers about what happened to our darling girl, while the details are poured over by strangers, seems bizarre. However, we are not alone in this. Inquests and investigations following state related deaths are intended to seek the truth and to expose unsafe practices or potential abuses of power by state agents. This is not just about respect for those whose lives wrecked by unspeakable loss; it is about protecting the public by preventing future harm and deaths. We have always maintained that what happened to Gaia is a matter not just of our private grief but one of public concern. Under Article 2 of the Human Rights Act, families have the right to meaningful participation in investigations. All too often this is not happening as it should. That is why families like ours, with support from the charity INQUEST, are campaigning to improve these systems. At present, we can only hope that a robust and unflinching investigation is taking place. With new statistics revealing the true scale of police failures to prosecute sexual violence and Dorset Police now rated worst in the UK, we are more determined than ever to see lessons learned from Gaias case, survivors access to justice improved and their voices heard.""",0,0

"Once upon a time, at a samba show where I was performing, one overzealous guest, in all his majestic virility, decided it was ok to be physically and verbally inappropriate with me. It was so unexpected (luckily this rarely happens to me) that I froze. Later, I felt so guilty for not saying you dont touch dancers or what youre saying is unacceptable that I was wishing I could go back in time to teach that man a lesson. I understand and accept how much growing up and living in a patriarchal society affects people (women, non-binary people, minorities, and of course men themselves). We all internalize how to praise certain gender roles and behaviors and how to despise and shame other attitudes. As a New England middle-aged white male watching a half naked black woman dance, perform for him, why would it occur to him he was inappropriate? Maybe he thought (if he thought at all), of course she doesnt mind being touched, shes half naked, shes asking for it! Or maybe he thought Its her fault, she should be wearing something to cover her body instead of provoking Of course, its easier to blame and shame the other for unsettling you. Such a mentality erases not only the value of the artistic performance he took great delight in watching, but it also erases the humanity of the person dancing in front of him. A human being is not a commodity. No matter how heavily or lightly dressed she is. And of course, dancers are not a receptacle for frustrated impulses. A huge thank you to my samba sisters  .",0,0

"Shannon Maley had a seeming vendetta against a 20-year-old man with learning disabilities who was dating her sister. She barely knew him, yet claimed he sexually assaulted her and her friends. Maley then created multiple social media accounts under the young mans name and sent herself disturbing and threatening messages in order to frame him. She has since pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and also to harassing witnesses, The Daily Record, a UK news publication reports. The young man, who will not be named by because he is the victim and will instead be referred to as John Doe, told the Record he was on the brink of suicide until he was acquitted last November on five charges of sexual assault. The outlet reported that he sat on the ledge of his 14th-storey flat window seriously contemplating whether life was worth living because of the vicious lies that had destroyed him. Maleys messages to herself included threats to set you on fire and watch you burn alive and claims that John was not going to stop causing you pain. Maley had apparently intimidated her friends into making accusations against John as well. One of those friends eventually admitted that the young man had not sexually assaulted her and that Maley had harassed her and tried to influence their testimony at John's trial. John was also accused of sexually assaulting two 15-year-old girls who were also allegedly friends of Maley. A witness explained that John didnt do what he was accused of doing, leading to acquittal on those charges. Maleys story unraveled after she accused John of sending a threatening message while he was in prison without access to the Internet. No reason has been given for Maleys vendetta against John, and the young man still fears for his safety. ""It feels like Shannon Maley has destroyed my life. I still cant walk down the street without people shouting abuse at me, John said. Ive had voicemails from people I dont even know saying theyre going to blow up my house. Unfortunately, people believe what they see online and its a very dangerous situation. She's an absolute monster. I want to see her punished for ruining my life.""",0,0

"Sunday Netflixing Westside Vs The World and Katie got me thinking about women in sport. . Westside is a great doc but spent about 2mins out of 96 showing or discussing their women, despite the fact that 1 of them is the strongest in the world to date. . Then the Katie film gave me a shock when they said that women's boxing wasn't sanctioned in Ireland until I shouldn't really be surprised since my secondary school only let boys do computer class. Girls did choir instead.  . Since I started Weightlifting I've struggled to understand what it must've been like for female lifters training before women were allowed to lift in the Olympics, which again was only in . It's totally normal for me to have elite lifters of my gender to fangirl at but they didn't have any. . Imagine being told by society that it doesn't matter how strong/fast/skilled you are, your sport doesn't count because you don't have a Y chromosome. . Even though I have my own issues with CrossFit, I feel like I have to give some due to the sport with popularising Weightlifting, for women especially, and with glamourising strong women. . Yes, sport is about physical ability. And yes, men are typically naturally stronger/faster than women, but come on, the attitude that says female sporting achievements deserve less recognition is seriously dated.

".o describes herself as a change catalyst, one devoted to making positive changes in her life, the lives of all around her and most especially Nigeria. She frequently describes herself in the words of Donovan Livingston as being a thorn in the side of injustice. She graduated from Louisville Girls High School in 2017 and recently graduated from where she completed her foundation and recently made top ten results with all As, and also joined the Team. She is going to University to study Law, as she hope she will later work with the International Court of Justice to ensure that leaders who violate human rights or do not serve as proposed face consequences of these actions, due to her believe that leaders form the government and the government indirectly shapes the lives of the citizens, nonetheless she believes that citizens should act if their governments fail to. Her zeal for justice is a defining and evident attribute of hers, proof of this comes from her selection as one of the 6 GirlChampions across the nation awarded with the GirlChild Award 2018 by the British High Commission. She also graduated with the the Ambassadorial award from her school. She believes in making changes in areas even those that may not directly affect us and thus she co-founded theilluminatemvmnt, a growing platform to educate people on diseases, disabilities and all related with the major aim of pushing for inclusion and empowerment of disabled persons.

"Please read this post till the end. Have you ever been called a Slut! and you took offence to the same? I would say, next time someone uses the word for you  take it as a compliment and say, THANK YOU!!!!!! . . Slut-shaming is the practice of criticizing people, especially women and girls, who are perceived to violate societal expectations of behaviour and appearance regarding issues related to sexuality. It may also be used in reference to gay men, who may face disapproval for sexual behaviours considered promiscuous. Examples of slut-shaming include being criticized or punished for dressing in perceived sexually provocative ways, requesting access to birth control, having premarital, casual, or promiscuous sex, engaging in prostitution, or when being victim blamed for being raped or otherwise sexually assaulted. . . Slut-shaming is attempting to admonish women for behaviour, attire or desires that are more sexual than society finds acceptable . . Slut-shaming rarely happens to heterosexual men, and in fact, there is no counterpart for the word Slut to describe men who do exactly the same thing! Heterosexual men rather wear their sexual promiscuity as a badge of honour and calling a man a Sult is most likely to get you a blank stare or a laugh! However, calling a woman the same would induce exactly the opposite reaction!! . . NOW, it is about time to drop the word SLUT from the lexicon of insults and reclaim the word from its usual use as a slur/insult; and USE IT TO SIGNIFY A PERSON, WHO REJECTS THE HACKNEYED WORLD VIEW THAT SEX BAD & ACCEPTS THAT THEIR ENJOYMENT OF SEX AND THE ENJOYMENT OF PHYSICAL INTIMACY IS AN ACT OF SELF CARE AND WHOLEHEARTED ACCEPTANCE OF ONES OWN NEEDS AND DESIRES.. . . . .",0,0

The right is being creative and crafty in this battle, so we need to be creative too. The right has come up with new and evil ways of stripping abortion access, and yet we on the left keep uttering the same platitudes about a woman's right to choose. We are bringing a knife to a gun fight. We need a more radical and imaginative strategy because the cost of losing is far too great. When the left frames the criminalization of abortion as a ""women's issue,"" it becomes seen as niche, impacting only a sliver of the population, rather than an urgent crisis like climate change or gun safety with dramatic wide-ranging public health consequences for all of us, men included. Abortion rights don't just enhance men's lives on a collective level, it allows them to thrive. One study found that boys who can avoid becoming teenage fathers have a greater chance of going to college if abortion is an option for them and their partner. Abortion being legal is associated with all kinds of positive measures of social good. Im sure at least one man on that stage last night was able to run for president because of the right to abortion and has benefited from the tireless work of justice advocates to plan and space out their children, most of the people who fought for those reproductive choice benefits are women!

"People get stuck for a change because they expect everything to be perfect. We want a perfect me, an ideal relationship, perfect sex, an excellent workout, the perfect career. We don't do it because we don't feel good when we do it. We are so afraid to fail. We worry that if we allow imperfection, we will lose our drive. That's not true. That's precisely what keeps us stuck. My breakthrough in morning routines happened when I accepted to be imperfect. I got up early in the morning because I decided to change my life. I got up early when I felt still sleepy when the last night I didn't sleep well. I went to the park to exercise, and the weather was not so good. I got seven mosquito bites, and I felt muscle sore because of my monthly period. However, I had never been so grateful in my heart. I started celebrating the beauty and blessings that were disguised in imperfections. I had no regrets for forgetting applying the mosquito repellent or feeling sore. I aspire to do it better next time, and I still appreciate my present state. This is how I get unstuck. Appreciate wherever you are and whoever you are right now. Do not demand yourself to be perfect. Set no condition for loving yourself while allowing yourself to aspire to be a better version of yourself.

They are best enjoyed in a park/on a beach/near a pool by James O'Brien is a short + quick read about the polarisation of politics. Using example conversations from his (very good) radio show, he demonstrates how to ask the right questions but also shows how big a role the media play in determining people's views. by is essential reading for everyone. That's it, that's the sell. by Tara Westover, the memoir you've probably seen everywhere by now, but for good reason! Beautifully + candidly written, this book will consume you. by Daniel Everett aka my absolute fave nonfic book. A linguist goes on a mission to a small tribe in the Amazon, + the more he learns about their life + language, the more complex his relationship with his mission becomes. Fascinating from a linguistic perspective + a great memoir! by , a gut-wrenching read about the Biafran War + its effects on everyone. by - everyone needs a doorstop book for summer + a history of humanity is a good one to go with. Provocative + engaging. by aka the novel unfairly scorned by all literary prizes. An epic family saga executed perfectly in 300 pages. by is another emotional read, but this time about one woman's desire to be a mother. I sobbed. by . Do I need to tell you to read this?

"""The Grass Is Greener If You Have A Weiner"".... YUP, I said it. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk! This piece was formed out of frustration at the attacks towards women and our rights. It seems everyone is thought to deserve body autonomy except us. The incredibly strict rulings in Georgia, Alabama, and Ohio are about policing women, not protecting fetuses or the women themselves. The world is a very closed off, regulated, and pro-shaming place as a woman. As more men escape repercussions of raping while womens lives remain forever changed, we are proving this is acceptable, that we are second class citizens. We are telling our girls to cover up and stay inside, while allowing our boys to act however they choose because they ""grow up slower."" Take note of every woman who apologizes throughout the day and pay attention to if they are even apologizing for something they need to be sorry for, or if it's simply been engrained in them to not take up too much space, be too loud, or ask too many questions. We've been conditioning the sexes into their roles for lifetimes without even questioning why and what that does to our society. We as artists and ceramicists have it in our own community, and I'm thankful to see us questioning practices and people speaking out for themselves and eachother.

"So, I did a thing today. I stepped far out of my comfort zone and wore a pantsuit to church today. . . Yeah, I know. To most Christians, it may not be a big deal. I mean, one of the local churches I visited here, the head pastor wore jeans with holes above the knees!! But, in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we try to wear our Sunday-best. Which, traditionally, means a dress or skirt for women. And sometimes, pantsuits are negatively associated for women to wear to my church. . . But, I found this adorable pantsuit at Wal-Mart for $7!!! I couldnt believe the price tag. And when I tried it on, I couldnt believe how flattering it looked on me! I have always loved and adored pantsuits and rompers and jumpsuits. But, its so hard to find one that covers my garments and looks flattering on my XL mommy-pouch muffin top. So, I immediately bought it. . . Then had the idea to wear it to church. It stayed with me for two weeks (last week, Rhys had a double ear infection so I stayed home). I wanted so badly to wear it to church as its more flattering than some skirts I have. But my anxiety and fear of being judged made me to nervous to commit. But after many talks with my husband who is more conservative than I am in all aspects, with my mom who I always go to for advice, and my sister who sometimes wears pantsuits to church herself, I got the same overwhelming response from all . . Just wear the darn pantsuit. . . So I did. I felt pretty. I felt worthy. And, no one said a thing. Plenty of people came up to me and commented my hair (thanks again to for the milkmaid braid suggestion for my LOOOONG hair). . . I cant believe how good it felt. How liberating. How freeing. How empowering. How sexyyes, I felt HOT. It was wonderful to still feel accepted without a blip or hesitation from my congregation. To feel just as close to my Savior. To feel comfortable, progressive, and still in my Sunday-best. I am so glad I listened and just wore the darn pantsuit.",0,0

"Reposted from () - The following is an abridged excerpt from Christina Hoff Sommers' brilliant book, The War Against Take Our Daughters to Work Day, the school holiday for girls introduced by the Ms. Foundation for Women, is now in its ninth year. For the first few years, it was a girls-only event. For their part, the Ms. organizers remain adamantly opposed to including boys. In 1996, Marie Wilson, president of the Ms. Foundation, began working with some feminist men's groups to design a separate holiday for boys. If boys had their own day, the pressure would be off. The first Son's Day was planned for Sunday, October 20, 1996. October was especially desirable because, as the Ms. planners pointed out, ""October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, so there will be lots of activities scheduled."" Here are some of the ways ""Son's Day"" was to be Take your sonor 'son for a day'to an event that focuses on ending men's violence against women. Call the Family Violence Prevention Fund at 800-END-ABUSE for information. Plan a game or sport in which the contest specifically does not keep score or declare a winner. Invite the community to watch and celebrate boys playing on teams for the sheer joy of playing. Since Son's Day is on Sunday, make sure your son is involved in preparing the family for the work and school week ahead. This helping lay out clothes for siblings and making lunches. For boys not exhausted by all the fun and excitement of the day's activities, the Ms. planners had a suggestion for the Take your son grocery shopping then help him plan and prepare the family's evening meal on Son's Day. As the Ms. staff had planned it, Son's Day would not even give the boys a day off from school. ====== Continue the book",0,0

"This post has actually made me sit and think and that isn't a usual thing for me to do when it comes to seeing sexism. But, like every other post, it is just as relevant so I will discuss it. It's interesting to think that girls can compliment girls, guys can compliment guys but guys cannot compliment girls and girls cannot compliment guys without society adding in their two pence and stating that there is an ulterior motive. A little birdy told me about his story and how he was explicitly reminded that commenting on a woman's deadlift form would be seen as creepy, even though he is an avid gym goer and apparently securing a decent form is a tricky thing to do. I'm not one of those people who you would ever catch in the gym but, if a guy commented on my body I would assume that they were just taking the piss out of how ridiculous I look. However, I have asked around about this and unfortunately the feedback supports the story. It's sad that society has conditioned us to believe that a genuine compliment does not exist from a straight guy. I totally understand why it's difficult to think any other way. Us women would find it just as creepy if a comment about our bodies was stated on the street, so why would we change our mindset just because we're in a gym - why would we think any different about it? Just as if a girl complimented a guy, it could be seen as them flirting as that's apparently the only reason why a girl would ever consider saying something nice about a guy. Of course we all know that's ridiculous when it's put like this, yet when it happens in a real life situation, our instinct is to jump to the latter reasons.

Yes, there is tremendous selfishness & harm taking place in the world , yes there is unending pain and suffering in the world, and worse, there is horrendous evil in the world in the form of billions of people striving to hurt, harm, exploit, use, abuse, or dominate and destroy other people and even countries on purpose! All of this is true! But heres my realization! . ... There is no Dark Force! There are only people USING THEIR GOD GIVEN UNLIMITED SOUL ENERGY FOR HURTING and TAKING POWER OVER OTHERS! GODS ENERGY IS UNLIMITED POWER, AS IN LIGHT POWER NOT DARK POWER! QUADRILLIONS OF WATTS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY, if you will.

"Unlearning and relearning I am not supposed to dress like this! There is a rule at my home that my parents, neighbors, relatives, extended family have made - don't wear short clothes! I really love wearing short clothes, but I never had the confidence to wear one as I was trained to thinking, wearing short clothes = bad girl I was really afraid of how people would slut shame if I wear short clothes. I still am to an extent! I still will definitely not wear this in my home town as it will be so ""odd"". However, I started wearing short clothes outside home. It breaks my heart when I think how I have to run as far as possible from my family to dress like I want to and live the life in a way I want to! The struggle is real, I love to see me wearing short clothes but I find it difficult to come out of the fear that everyone back home is going to judge me and put me in a bad light. Probably they are gonna judge me for posting this as well. I have this fear inside, back in my mind, but I am still going to post this! Huge shout out to my husband , he gives me the confidence and courage to stand against all these negativities. He says I look good in whatever I love to wear, short or long, doesn't matter. He supports me to do what I want to do, cheering me up and also criticises me when needed. He made me realise how it is really important to have someone to be there, no matter what. Isn't that a blessing! To feel happy, blessed and secure with someone who will support all your dreams. It really helps to have someone beside when you are trying to unlearn certain bad things that you have learnt since childhood. For me, doing a PhD and science, doesn't just mean understanding the nature. The opportunity to come out of my country for my PhD has helped me to unlearn, relearn, change and grow as a person. Science and Education truly has helped me to empower myself. And I hope I can continue strong and give back.",0,0

"Noor Inayat Khan - Indian Princess & British Spy Khan was a direct descendant of Tipu Sultan, the 18th century Muslim ruler of Mysore. Khan's father was a musician and Sufi teacher. He moved his family first to London and then to Paris, where Khan was educated and later worked writing childrens' stories. Khan, whose name was in the news in Britain recently as a proposed new face of the 50 note, was 25 when war was declared in 1939. She and her family went to England to volunteer for the war effort, and in 1940 she joined the Womens Auxiliary Air Force and trained to become a radio operator. Able to speak French, she was quickly chosen to go to Paris to join the Special Operations Executive, a secret British organization set up to support resistance to the Germans from behind enemy lines through espionage and sabotage. Many members of the network were arrested shortly afterwards but she chose to remain in France, trying to send messages back to London while avoiding capture. Her transmissions became the only link between the agents around the Paris area and London, Ms. Basu wrote in her biography Spy The Life of Noor Inayat Khan. Khan never made it home from the war. Just as she was about to leave for England in October 1943, she was captured by the Gestapo. Despite repeated torture, she refused to reveal any information and was finally shot and executed in the Dachau concentration camp. For her courage, Noor Khan was posthumously awarded the George Cross in 1949. plays Noor in the film A call to Spy along with the stunning -",0,0

"This statue has a kinda sad and beautiful story, but the one I'm going to tell you today is another one, it's the one that happened when I was taking this photo. I was making the best of the moment since there was no tourist groups there at the moment and I could take some clean shots, I walked down a bunch of slippery rocks to try this angle because it seemed a nice one, when I was ready to take the shot, feet secured in gaps to be stable and not slide down and fall to the rocks and then the river because I couldn't grab on anything as I was holding the camera, I heard a tour guide from above, on the bridge, saying to his group of tourist ""yeah there is the fish-man statue, blah blah blah, yeah some girls enjoy snapping his crotch, very well very well"" so here I was, apparently risking falling down and get some nice injuries just to snap a pic of the crotch of a statue. It probably was just a funny comment, there was not evil in it, I'm not even 100% sure if he said it because of me or if it's something he always says, it probably shouldn't be a big deal, but I don't care.

They felt like they were 'in the way' of the lads doing the big weights or embarrassed that they were 'doing it all wrong'. We wanted to provide an environment where we took away that obstacle to training and create one where women could come to learn and be coached without feeling those stresses.

"Trigger RAPE. I was friend requested on FB by some dude who had several mutual friends and I usually delete those requests, but I didnt this time because he worked in a similar field as me and I like to network with those people. He posted a really cringey meme that sparked a hot debate on rape victim blaming. You know the what was she wearing, was she drunk or being flirty... she mustve been asking for it. I and another woman presented an articulate defense in a strong, but not hateful way. Thats when the misogynists started creeping on our profiles and calling us all sorts of horrible names, attacking our character, even attacking our children. One even told me I was an old, ugly hag with saggy boobs that no one would ever touch, so I shouldnt have worries about getting raped. You know, this didnt even piss me off. All it did was expose himself to look like a fucking dumbass. I am a rape and assault survivor. My first assault- I was 16 years old. I was not wearing provocative clothing, I was not drinking or asking for it. I was at a friends house in high school and he and his friend drugged me- I was literally drinking Sprite and eating Cheetos . I was in and out of consciousness as they moved a coffee table and pulled my 410 body like a ragdoll on the floor, both of them assaulting me fully while I couldnt move, I couldnt scream, and was blacking out during the attack. I share this because no one is going to tell me I have saggy boobs and no one is going to tell a woman that she was asking to be raped.

" Nymphomania, or hypersexuality, refers to an extremely frequent or suddenly increased libido. Historically, nymphomania has referred to hypersexuality in women and ""satyriasis"" the same in men.  As a clinical diagnosis, nymphomania is controversial. It is not considered a formal diagnosed disorder by mental health professionals. Including ""sexual addiction"" in the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) - a set of standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders - has been suggested but as yet is not included, although hypersexuality is sometimes included as a symptom of other mental disorders. Nymphomania has also been used as a derogatory label to discredit women with high sex drives or sexual desires considered to be ""abnormal"". Labeling a woman a ""nymphomaniac"" is closely linked to slut-shaming where a woman is judged for having sex, enjoying sex or having sex with multiple partners. Sex positivity allows for the full spectrum of human sexual desires and means taking a non-judgemental stance towards someone's sex life, no matter how much or how little sex they choose to have. . . . . .

For a control freak like me- this is the only time I am able to let go of control and still get my needs met (and ohhhhh- how they get met ) With the right man With the right communication With the right level of trust There is a power in submissiveness- the act of letting go - trusting another person with your body - with your heart - with your soul To allow yourself this level of vulnerability - this level of powerlessness - is the ultimate in intimate power Chris and I have an agreement - Fuck safe words.

"SEXUAL HARASSMENT.. . . This article is written in a hugely problematic way. . . Lets start with the headline. The headline itself tries to justify this mans disgusting behaviour by explaining that the sexual harassment began after a steamy Christmas party - the truth being that the victim had danced sexually with her manager at the party and told him she wasnt wearing underwear. Yes, that is sexual behaviour. Yes, she seems to be initiating sexual relations with him. However, the headline fails to mention that when the completely unwelcome and unreciprocated workplace sexual harassment began (including kissing her uninvited and without warning, putting his hands inside her clothing, sitting her on his knee, asking her for sex/sexual favours and much more than just the question in the headline), the victim made it very clear that she was not interested. She made it very clear that she felt uncomfortable and yet it continued. At this point, any sexual behaviour at a work Christmas party is null, void and irrelevant to the case. This headline fails to really tell the story and depicts the victim as a flakey woman who changed her mind last minute and made a bogus sexual harassment claim. . . Second problem with JUST the headline. The DM seem to try to garner some sympathy for the abuser by explaining his gross and inappropriate behaviour as an infactuation. This word has romantic and passionate connotations. There is nothing romantic or passionate about sexual harassment. . . The body of the article itself goes on to describe him as a family man who has ran an honest business since the 90s. Which is more COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT INFORMATION only included to try to demonise the victim and gain sympathy for the harasser. It invites the comments of how she has ruined his career and cant take a joke by reporting his harassment. . . If there are any male (or female) followers out there who are unsure of how to approach women and date without being accused of harassment or rape in this generation we live in, the answer is dont do anything creepy and youll be fine. The linked article is a great starting point for understanding further.",0,0
"When we experience trauma, or even simple rejection, at work, we often spiral into a cycle of self-criticism and suspicion. We constantly ask ourselves questions like, ""What am I doing wrong? What are they thinking about me? What if I'm not cut out for this?"" This feels terrible, and our brains are quick to list everything that's wrong with us.  These self-criticisms are not observations. They are self-abuse.   The process of simply shifting the questions we ask ourselves every day can make a huge difference. Instead of ""What's going wrong?"" my clients often try out asking their brains questions like, ""How can I build more support?"" ""What if I'm right?"" and ""What if I inherently deserve respect?""   Instead of asking, ""Who might be out to get me?"" we shift to ""Who is a potential ally?"" Redirecting our brains to see what is working in our favor helps shift power dynamics to create the outcome we want.   More on that  If you know someone who feels alone and afraid at work, encourage them to reach out. I'd love to talk and see if I can help.  ",0,0

"Posted  .and.ancestors In February 1970, Kathleen Cleaver, communication secretary of the Black Panther Party (BPP), was asked by a reporter from the womens page of the Washington Post what she thought was a womans role in the revolution. She responded, in No one ever asks what a mans place in the Revolution is.1 To many, the BPP conjures up a hypermasculine image of Black men in leather coats and berets carrying shotguns. Yet at its heightaccording to a survey conducted by Chairman Bobby Seale in 1969the party membership was over 60 percent female.2 These women were integral to every aspect of party life, including serving as prominent leaders. Yet until recently, much of their work has been sidelined in historical research and popular media. Recent scholarship is shedding light on the role of women in the BPP and the Black struggle more broadly. For activists involved in todays strugglesfrom women who have been at the forefront of the Black Lives Matter movement, to the widespread impact and identification with (which among other things has prompted a reckoning with sexism within activist spaces), to the popular use of the term intersectionality to make sense of the interlocking forces of racial, class, and gendered oppressionthe experience of women in the BPP offers a host of lessons. The BPP emerged in an era of global mass revolt. In the United States, the struggle against anti-Black racism was the central flashpoint that opened up a mass radicalization around a whole host of issuesfrom war and imperialism, to womens and LGBT oppression, to class inequality and capitalism. By the end of the 1960s, millions of young Americans believed a revolution was necessary in this country and thousands flooded into revolutionary groups like the BPP. The BPPs Ten Point Program outlined a vision for liberation, encompassing demands for jobs, housing, education, and self-determination. In its early phase, the partys activity focused on point the fight against police brutality. Making use of their Constitutional rights, the Panthers boldly asserted their intention to use arms to defend the Black community from pol",0,0

"When I was 18 I had the chance through my local Community College to study abroad in London, England for 3 months. As a person who had been passionate about theater and history and separated from my English mother and family, this was a trip of a lifetime, a chance to answer questions I'd always had. At the time, I was still dating my high school boyfriend and I told him how excited I was for it, wondering if he would want to come along. Upon hearing this, my abstinence-only parents told me that if he went I would have to stay home. It was so important to them that I didn't have sex before marriage that they were going to ostensibly let me miss out on this trip because, unsupervised in another country, they saw sex as inevitable--even though I wore a purity ring and had promised I wouldn't have sex before marriage and was terrified of getting pregnant out of wedlock because my parents did and my birth mother ultimately chose not to be with my dad and I anymore--I thought I could avoid that pain for my future kids. Thankfully my boyfriend didn't want to go on the trip so I went and it changed my life. I fell deeply in love with the Scottish land and met estranged cousins who have now become close family. Undecided on my life path, it was in London I dedicated myself to being a writer who would make a difference in the world while sitting in Hyde Park and read incredible literature on the Tube. I finally learned how to draw by sketching the Elgin marbles and saw Shakespeare on the Globe stage, a place I had read about as a childhood theater nerd countless times and wept at the incredible magnitude of humanity. Now I know more about Empire (Hey !!) and my relationship to my mothers, my parents, my body, my sexuality. But this obsession with virginity and abstinence still hurts me on a daily basis. Today it was a sting, remembering that my dad and I didn't used to have the relationship we have today and what it would have meant to me to have to miss that life-changing adventure because of my sexuality and my body. Sex is normal. Your body belongs to you. And we must stop lying to children about their bodies.",0,0

Just like humans, female cows need to have babies to produce milk, they dont just produce milk naturally.

"Domesticity is Dead! Inspiration for my spoof book cover, 'Lidl Women' is of course Louisa May Alcotts Little Women. An important feminist text; subtle in its way, exploring the independence and agency of women in the man's world of 19th centur in the USA. Jo, an outspoken Tomboy refuses marriage, displays a rebellious spirit that endears us to her. This image shows pages from a first edition illustrated by Louisa's sister May, on which I have scrawled 'Domesticity is Dead'. This is a statement inflected from Nieztche's ""God is dead, and we killed it!"".

"If you cant see it, you cant be it. Thats not new, but neither sadly is the recent finding that astronaut is still way down the list of career aspirations for young girls at around 10%, despite the work being done to encourage more women in STEM (study by LEGO). So how can we encourage all children to believe they can be an astronaut, should they want to be? Well, if we want change, we need to take responsibility to effect it ourselves. Another recent study by toy brand Mattel showed that 80% of parents lacked knowledge of STEM careers for their children to aspire to, and this was even more the case when it came to parents knowledge of any female STEM role models. So, as parents and caregivers, lets build our knowledge of the possible careers for our children, regardless of gender, and actively help raise awareness of the role models out there in careers that defy the traditional gender norms.

"Happy pub day to THE GREATER FREEDOM!  This memoir is giving me so much food for thought. Alya Mooro eloquently describes the pressures experienced by Middle Eastern women, some of which are achingly familiar and others which are unique to her culture. it's published by my employer.)  I just finished a chapter about attitudes to sex. Mooro describes how her mother explained sex to don't do it before marriage or no one will love you. ""Where was any mention of my desires or my feelings in that conversation?"" she asks. Her question made me reflect on my own learning experiences - and how I relied on fiction to fill the knowledge void.  At school, we had (laughingly incomplete) sex ed focused on periods and erections. The baseline was for women the focus was procreation, for men their urges.  Then my father took me aside and told me that society was boys could sleep around but girls couldn't. 11-year-old-me was too naive to question WHO those boys were sleeping with, or why gender inequality was an acceptable status quo.  Years later, when my mother finally sat me down to have ""the talk"", it lasted all of one awkward minute where she obliquely asked if I was being safe. (As always, the onus falls on women.)  No one taught me about love, about consent, about desire. If it weren't for fiction, I would have had an entirely one dimensional view about sex as a currency between genders. Something that my value would be judged on by, as Mooro puts it, the invisible jury of society.  But while books helped plug the void, all-too-often fiction (and especially fantasy) has a warped representation of relationships. It's only now as an adult that I realise how damaging fiction can be in romanticising unacceptable behaviour - particularly in genres targeted at teens. I can't help but wonder how many girls are learning about sex and consent through books like I did... and how much YA authors should take responsibility for changing the narrative of what a healthy relationship looks like.  What good or bad examples of fictional relationships can you think of?",0,0

"""It was just a few weeks after we had given our twelfth board exams and were preparing for entrances. One evening, I was talking to a school mate over the phone, who happened to be a friend back then. Like usual, we were generally joking about the school days and discussing the exam strategies and the expected grades in final exams. Out of no where, to my surprise, he said something that was the least expected of him and that left me blank for sometime. Well, in the most casual manner he said- "" why do you girls these days work so hard in all the possible fields, when you know that in the end you have to marry a rich man who is well to do?"" I was at first shocked to hear such a statement for i was always taught the importance of being independent by my parents; but I also wondered about the audacity he had to make a statement so audacious without any thought and shame. We did have an argument on that; yet he stuck to defend himself. We hardly spoke after that day for he went a bit too ahead in order to just prove himself right . But what's more is the fact that this incident made me realize how sexism is deep-rooted and exists in the most casual forms which we at times tend to ignore or not make a note of; and this goes on to degrade the mentality even further."" . . .",1,1
"Purity culture is toxic.   The concept of virginity has always baffled me. The idea that people are forever altered by having engaged in sexual intercourse is just silly. It also doesnt leave much room for people who engage in same sex relationships. If youve had plenty of sex, but never engaged in PIV sex.. are you a virgin? Unclear.  I had a teenager recently tell me that people at their middle school use an analogy to compare the significance of male vs female sexuality. The analogy goes like a lock that gets opened by a lot of keys is a bad lock, but a key that opens a lot of locks is a good key. This is the kind of crap that gets perpetuated by purity culture.   Placing importance on purity or virginity is especially problematic for someone whos been sexually abused/assaulted. They get the shame of being sexual humans *gasp* after having sex forced upon them.  At the heart of it, the concept of virginity in our culture creates sexual shame. Shame surrounding sexuality contributes to low self esteem, anxiety, depression, etc. At its worst sexual shame causes people to misunderstand consent and/or perpetrate sexual violence on others. One small way to counter this is to reject purity culture and stop using the word virginity.",0,0

"Been pointing those toes since 2006 . This was from Foxys pole studio in Flint before she moved to Florida. Had so much fun with these ladies. . I originally fell in love with pole while stripping. It helped me explore my sensuality and sexuality. I fucking loved it. Stripping helped me break through a lot of negativity and shame that I was carrying about my sexuality and body. It taught me how to set boundaries and how to value my time. It helped me to move and try different cities, leave a physically and emotionally abusive ex and study music. . When I stopped dancing, I didnt want to stop pole. Luckily, thats exactly when pole dance became a new fitness regime and studios started opening up all over. Once a stripper always a stripper  . Now go tip your local hard-working strippers and stop fucking slut shaming & judging .",0,0

Except if this model was really on the train, all the men would be gawking at her shamelessly. Nevertheless, this makes me think about the absolutely free world men inhabit, with zero fucks to give, while women are constantly made to feel self-conscious and vulnerable, mostly by the unaplogetic and often shameless male gaze that follows them everywhere they go.

Viji and Rebekah had to stand next to the smelly toilets to iron and curl the hair as that was the only working electrical point, also wait for the train to stop to put a correct eyeliner and change in the cramped toilets.

"One question I get often is around how the hell someone can be intuitive and spiritual, and somehow be wrong about people or not always know ahead of time that someone is a big creep. Doesnt that mean youre actually not that intuitive then?? This is something that I get asked, by two main men who are (most likely) creeps/victim blamers, and also by women/femmes who have been made to feel that their spiritual practice is invalid and their intuition must be a sham because they didnt know ahead of time that someone who ended up hurting them was about to. I want to hug all the femmes who ask me this, and smack all the men who ask me this. Not to oversimplify, but I know femmes ask me this because someone has made them feel as though the abuse or bad treatment they have experienced is completely their fault, and they should have known if they are spiritual. And what a fucking convenient narrative; who does that serve? It sends victims/survivors into a shame spiral, and has them questioning and second guessing something that is often a massive pillar of spirituality, witchcraft, magic, and intuition. In case its not crystal fucking clear to yall at this point, anyone who blames a victim for being harassed, assaulted, or violated, is a trash bag of a person. This has even happened to me before. My intuition is pretty fucking good; ask literally anyone who has ever had a tarot reading with me. And yet, I too have had some bad experiences with people who at first gave off a loving, kind, genuine energy. Its easy to believe that mask, and many sketchy people are very good at projecting authenticity and trustworthiness. Our guard cant be 100% up 100% of the time, its impossible. And its exhausting to be always vigilant. Eventually, some people may show us who they REALLY are underneath it all, after a few drinks, and sometimes its disappointing. Sometimes we only realize it after being hurt by words and actions. And then we can peace out, say nahhh Im not interested. When ppl DO show u who they are, LISTEN. Thats not the its real. The blip of bad behaviour is often the real thing, however many apologies may be made.",0,0

"GOOD IS BORING Girls and boys in our society are constantly trained to be good girls and good boys. But the norms of this good and bad are a bit skewed. From the complicatedness of not hurting anyone it comes down to a simple factor, viz. those who follow their impulses are bad people and those who don't are good. Especially who practice casual sex, polyamory, ploygamy, freelove, are labelled as bad because of their evolved sexual choices and behavior. Outcome, both men and women begin living their life containing their natural impulses and trying to forcefully fit themselves into the bracket of so-called good behavior. And in this process, they end up hurting and moreso, crushing the morale of those who follow their true instincts. Eventually, ending up being the bad people they don't want to be. But the blinders of uprightness put upon their eyes, doesn't ever let them realise this. These acts range from slut and fuckboy shaming to insulting the PRIDE community, accumulating and nurturing all the negativity in their minds, with the sole purpose of getting a place in society, than getting place in heaven. Because society is heaven for some. But in this process, they end up developing fascination for those who live life on their own terms or simply put, the bad people. Sometimes, it takes the form of love. But only with the righteous edge of changing these people later, betting on turning them GOOD with their perceived idea of true love, or 'Saccha Pyaar'. But the the so called bad lot is miles ahead in terms of self discovery and experimentation with life, being the black sheep of our society. They look at these plain Janes as under-evolved, regressive or basic. They find absence of guts in these good people not so exciting, and at times also delimiting. more so, when it comes to sex. Honestly said, they find the good people boring. Such relationships don't usually take off at all, or end very soon. If not, they keep suffocating each other under the burden of their ideologies, destroying each other's potential, and thereby life. (Except for hypocrite misogynists like Arjun Reddy and Kabir Singh who sleep with everyone and love only one.)..[Contd. in comments]",1,1

"SLUT ARCHETYPE ~ Read on to see why we use this charged word She is your JOY, PLEASURE, RADIANCE, PLAYFULNESS, DESIRE, SENSUALITY & ALIVENESS Dancing Eros purposely chooses Slut to take away the negative charge around how this word is used. There is a deep wounding in our society around women and pleasure. A women who owns her pleasure & her sexuality is often seen as wrong & bad (SLUT SHAMING). Studies also show that women judge each other for this far more than men! So we shut down our natural ability to feel pleasure, express it and own it through fear of being judged and shamed. Not just in the bedroom but in all areas of life. . When was the last time you squeeled with delight, played & danced around the house, savoured every little taste of a delicious piece of chocolate without guilt, enjoyed touching your body, dived in to the fullness of your senses? We become so empty & numb of pleasure in our own bodies that we grasp for it outside of us with unhealthy relationships to food, alcohol, drugs etc. Dont get me wrong.. I love (and have!) wine & chocolate and all the delicious things just like anyone! BUT is this the only way we are filling ourselves with pleasure? Plus the more we link shame with a certain desire or pleasure the more it will move in to shadow, it wont go away, so it becomes distorted and then the cycle of shame continues. This energy teaches us that pleasure is natural, it is a birthright, a thing our bodies were naturally designed to feel, to own our desires and to know that pleasure comes from the inside out. You ARE deserving of pleasure in your life! . by",0,0

"Assalamualaikum Everyone! May Allah guide us all, ameen. Why do I begin with this Dua today ? Because it's direly needed. More than ever. After two weeks of hectic checking sessions and getting over with the midterm parents teacher meeting, I wanted to relax myself by sleeping or else watching TV. So when I open up my TV, to my utter horror and disgust I see a teacher giving up on his life and his fight for Honor to the so called feminist who actually used the woman card and the famous movement in her own bush league paradigm. So where did we lack as a society? Where do we find our shortcomings? Was the movement wrong or the label? THE WRONG is US. We used media not to circulate positive and true news but false feed more. Allah Behold, you received it on your tongues, and said out of your mouths things which you had no knowledge of; and you thought it to be a light matter, while it was most serious in the sight of Allaah (Surah 15) But... We used our liberty of speech to express slanderous stuff and spite. To spread rumors. To take advantage through our words. And we don't stop here, we don't look for proofs but we JUDGE. We use social media ,print media or whatever means we have to judge people because we think that there's a specific stigma attached to a specific gender,ergo it MUST BE TRUE. IT IS TRUE. IT CAN NEVER BE WRONG. BUT... Say (O Muhammad), Produce your proof if you are truthful Please dear men and women , please I repeat, DONOT BE THE JUDGES TO SOMETHING YOU HAVE NO PROOF OF. The man just took his life because he knew, people had already believed what was said about him. He was accused and even when he was proven not guilty he took his life because he knew ""THE ALL MEN ARE SAME"" slogan will follow him everyday. He knew he would have looks of disdain from those he deserved respect from. Beware people, THIS IS BIGGER THAN YOU THOUGHT! 1/2 ... continued",0,0

"Today is my Birthday. It took me 36 years to realize I am ageless and all ages and very powerful. Ive never felt more energized and more tired, more motivated and more over it, more supported and more under appreciated, more seen and silenced. Its very confusing, but I do know Im becoming my best self amidst all the cosmic alignments and challenges that no one sees in this selective Instagram reality show . This photo was taken by an Angel in the desert ( ) a few weeks ago during s residency. I asked to paint my ears gold and blue for my Hermit portrait as a Siren/Seabird. I am the Hermit, I am a Knight, I am a Shaking Artist. I am a Queen and Priestess and Lost Boy and Forever-punk. I am a Witch and Baller and Siren. I am a bolt of lightning and I will strike with precision. What I want for my birthday is for people to listen and hear and amplify my/our alarm calls, to pool their electric charge. I ask you to HAVE MY BACK. I want you to know that I have yours. I ask you push your comfort zones and fuck social capital and stand with others in your life who are not heard, believed or protected. Sharpen your swords and backbones and go to bat. I give myself permission to be a (birthday)Bitch and a Witch and hold love and friendship to high standards. We have to believe deep deeeeep down that the White Supremacist Patriarchy will not save us even if we benefit from its manipulation in the short term. Take risks that arent publicly applauded. Life is too short to play safe. I hold a mirror to these demands so that they will also hold me accountable .",0,0

"New logo because... were nearly ready to unveil our plans! But for now, let us tell you a bit more about what were here for and Our mission is to inspire and empower future generations to grow up to be anything they want to be, free from limiting stereotypes around gender and other aspects of identity. Why? Not only will we not see equal parenting responsibilities, pay, opportunities and leadership representation in our lifetimes, but were on track not to see it in our childrens lifetimes either. Were not willing to wait that long! While initiatives exist to tackle these issues (e.g. shared parental leave and gender pay gap policies), we need to start closer to home  and that means closer to birth. Gender stereotypes start to form in childrens minds by two, and by five, these develop into self-limiting beliefs about what they can or cant do, or who they should or shouldnt be. By six, these are children believe girls arent strong, boys shouldnt show emotion, and that jobs have genders (girl jobs and boy jobs) Children grow up to make choices around careers and identities based on those stereotypes set in early childhood  beliefs that are incredibly hard to dislodge. This means that as important as policies to address adulthood inequality are, the reality is that these do too little, and are likely fifteen years too late. So how do we raise a generation of equals? Well, thats where our plans come in. We have an exciting new initiative that we cant wait to tell you about! What a tease, eh? More very soon... . . .",0,0

"I was stunned when I found out it was these online ride hailing platforms still use such gender stereotypes in their limited avatar selection even when its already the year of 2019. It's most likely the idea is to cater to the deeply sexist male population that makes up the majority of users of these platforms.The reality is that the vast majority of drivers on China's ride hailing Apps are still men while the majority of passengers are women and discrimination against women drivers is deeply rooted in the driver group. We see that women's images in these avatars are invariably associated with the symbols of luxury, money, sweetness, and sexiness that typify the males materialization of women, meantime men's images include elements of fashion, sport, classic and elegance. My first reaction as a woman was to feel helpless disgust at all the roll of pink images and the only avatar I could choose to be really interested in was the football icon. And I sincerely wonder is this offensive to some male friends who take these misogyny phenomena for granted?",1,1

"Learning in a predominantly very small anglo Saxon Liberal Arts College in affluent area of Staten Island was a cultural shock for some. I was very comfortable in my skin, regardless of my setting. My high school was like the United Nations from every cultural and working class status. There were billionaires to a working middle class to blue collar working class. However I will never forget in my freshmen first semester what my college room mate said, Wow you are different. I thought all black people lived like the actors on the TV series Good Times! Really ! This is when the Cosby Show and A Different World showed college educated black people on prime T.V. The scary part is that she was from Southern New Jersey!

We, as men, are the problem and so we need to utilize our words and our actions to truly effect change. As I promised you two years ago, I will be your example on how to respect, encourage and appreciate all women, especially your mom. We got this. Love, Dad",0,0

"Are witches a goodie or a baddie in your house? Part 2 of feminist chats with my kid My little asked me this the other day -why are witches bad? I agree with them. Why ARE witches always the scary baddie? Wart on the nose, eating very odd concoctions of vermin and herbs, poking kids with long nails, trapping them in cages, having delusions and chatting to mirrors... Heres a few reason why witches are ALSO a goodie in my house (and ALWAYS a goodie when Im playing the game ) Because witches are awesome Because goodie female characters dont get much of a look in beyond Princess Because witches are awesome Because its a great opportunity to show little people that powers can be used for bad or good Because witches are awesome (you get the idea right?) Because many women were murdered, violated, ostracised, assaulted, financially and socially ruined through witchcraft accusations. Feels kinda dark to reinforce that negative perception which facilitated this to happen through games we play with kids... Because knowing about herbs, medicine, midwifery, putting a middle finger up to social norms, farting at the patriarchy, embracing the sisterhood, and caring for animals are all things I want my little people to emulate Because being able to cast spells and fly on broomsticks is bloody awesome! Just because a woman is powerful, a bit scary and uncontrollable, that does not make her bad Because there are many people who identify with witch as a religion (Wicca, Druid, Pagan etc) and we shouldnt portray this group through stereotypes and negative images and finally, because witches are AWESOME! So scrap the witch stereotypes. Whos your favourite witch? Im particularly enamoured with Angelina Jolies Maleficent ",0,0

Is fat worse than vindictive, jealous, shallow, vain, boring or cruel? Not to me; but then, you might retort, what do I know about the pressure to be skinny? Im not in the business of being judged on my looks, what with being a writer and earning my living by using my brain  I went to the British Book Awards that evening. After the award ceremony I bumped into a woman I hadnt seen for nearly three years. The first thing she said to me? Youve lost a lot of weight since the last time I saw you!  Well, I said, slightly nonplussed, the last time you saw me Id just had a baby.  What I felt like saying was, Ive produced my third child and my sixth novel since I last saw you. Arent either of those things more important, more interesting, than my size? But no  my waist looked smaller! Forget the kid and the finally, something to celebrate!  Ive got two daughters who will have to make their way in this skinny-obsessed world, and it worries me, because I dont want them to be empty-headed, self-obsessed, emaciated clones; Id rather they were independent, interesting, idealistic, kind, opinionated, original, funny  a thousand things, before thin.

Society sadly itself doesn't take any actions, you can boycott the individual who does such act, you can terminate your relations with someone whom you know is involved in such terrible acts.

"Just completed 'More Than Two' by Franklin Veaux and Eve Rickert on Audible. I consider this book an excellent resource for anyone living in today's society. Whether or not you yourself are non-monogamous or curious about it, you are likely to encounter someone in your community who is, and this is a great book to help understand different avenues for creating relationship and empathy for those friends. For some, non-monogamy is considered a choice and for others it may be a deeper part of their personality. There is no 'better' or 'more enlightened' way to organize your relationship(s). There is, however, the reality that we live in a monogamous oriented society where most of us have not had as many, if any, solid examples of nonmonogamy. Also, slut shaming is still very much a part of the culture that we are collectively and intentionally replacing. Slut shaming is just one example of how we are subconsciously, or more overtly, coerced into monogamous lifestyles without free choice. One of my biggest take always from this book is how they gently break down all the ways we may try and coerce a relationship to be a certain way. The difficult conversations that include our fears, jealousy, judgements, anger, and insecurities of all sorts are so easily bypassed because they truly are difficult. Practicing these conversations and giving yourself space to explore these uncomfortable spaces is necessary for fulfilling relationships regardless of monogamy or nonmonogamy. If you are struggling with any of these issues or curious about exploring new territory in either direction, email me at bohelerlovage.com to schedule you're free intake call. The Somatica Method is a holistic, efficient, embodied based modality of intimacy coaching. You will leave each session with new tools and having a vulnerability based experience with me.

Im 28 years old and the sticks and stone my break my bones but words will never hurt me is THE BIGGEST LIE We could ever tell ourselves or our children. Words cut deeper. Id rather throw an fn boulder than degrade me. I have a lot of shame but none about speaking out about hurt. Not to mention humility and transparency to share with people how my heart deeply hurts. I am sooooo far from perfect but I assure you I think way worse of myself than anyone else could make me feel. I have the lowest self esteem in all of man kind Im certain. No one is harder on me, than me. People really need to consider what they say to people and how it makes them feel especially people that say they love you. If you dont have good intentions or you want to hurt my crippled soft heart just do me a favor and go on... Ive suffered enough. All the therapy in the world and I still dont love me.

"True love wont hurt you....its the false person you have it to that does . Heart vs mind.....delusion vs reality. Cohabitants in the realm of decision making that seems devoid of tact, yet so forthcoming in tenacity. The wretched subterfuge of love winces as your subconscious takes over. There is no victorious element to this epic battle, your soul is always the victim. Where were you so nice to prevent their hurt, when they responded with an undeserved arrogance that makes you appear worse off? Why didn't you straight out go for what you wanted, regardless of the effect on them? It's that connection you made between the two, the connection that makes you different from others, but will seal your downfall. Without your mind what is the heart? It's merely an organ fulfilling its purpose, without heart what is the mind? It's a derelict battlefield left to cause havoc with anyone and anything that may enter its remit. A labyrinth of unanswered emotion, only open to logic and devoid of passion. Is that a way to live? . Others will always disappoint, will assume they are worth more than they are and will take kindness for weakness. Why? Because your ego allowed that. You preserved their humility at the expense of yours as you knew they needed that smile more.....that's ok, let them have it. Let them know kindness is your strength, and without it, as you walk away.....they look weaker than ever .",0,0

For me, its insane how much money goes into keeping people/women quiet about the lewd acts of prominent figures.  These men have the power to control the outcome of so many peoples careers, and they take advantage of that power, and they get away with it, while everyone blames the victim  Personally, (in the past) I have been in situations like some of these women.

"I gave into the hype. I read The Testaments....  I found that the book was a definite page turner, that is undeniable. However, as a sequel of The Handmaids Tale I was underwhelmed. HT is much more of a food-for-thought novel, making the reader think of things beyond the words on its pages. It functions as a mirror looking back at us, highlighting the human tendency to simply adjust to the most grotesque situations we are put in if we are caught off guard or simply confused.  The Testaments is not of the same literary depth as its predecessor. The focus is on 3 different narrative voices providing their testaments about why they went against the tyranny in Gilead, giving their individual, yet intertwined, experiences of the patriarchy. With Aunt Lydia reappearing as one of the narrative voices, Atwood has clearly given insight into practicalities of Gilead and perhaps reasoning behind some of the HT events. Aunt Lydia is by far the most intriguing and substantial narrative in the novel. Despite not having the literary heft of Atwoods 1985 novel, The Testaments does give the sense of commentary in the era, with characters not accepting the unacceptable and acting on injustice. Taking matters into your own hands and doing what has to be done to make the world a safer place for women/children. Thus, like the HT it still has a sense of being written to make a point about society. I did find Atwoods novel entertaining and engaging (although not as engaging as HT). With such anticipation placed on Atwood, I believe that the most negative reactions are based on the exceedingly high expectations built over 35 years of waiting for answers. Overall, it is still a great novel that provides readers with a suspenseful read, incorporating some of its predecessors themes of providing commentary on the society we live in.  ",0,0

" List of sexist remarks I have encountered in the past 1. ""Women's identity is from her husband. I don't do house chores because this is Pakistan not Europe."" (Coming that from a guy who is raised by a single mother says a lot about how internalized this concept is within the minds of Pakistani people with or without men setting such precedents.) 2. ""I hate it when women play the card of 'don't tell me what to do' because, if you don't obey me, I am obviously going to get angry and scold you."" 3. ""Men should 'sacrifice' their right to dowry so that the show off culture in the society diminishes, the culture whose leaders are women."" 4. ""Atleast, I don't have to put tons of makeup to look pretty."" 5. ""My brother is additional secretary who has a higher status than your father and he still likes that his wife cooks him food. That is what our religious, social and cultural values are."" 6. ""Feminist hou per limits main reh kar. Aurat march type na bano."" All this is besides the general disparaging comments that I received from them on my looks during a very normal discussion from these unrelatedly related men. Why is it so hard for men to accept that sometimes there is no right and wrong and just a difference of opinion? They can stoop to any level in order to boast their little egos. All for what? I tell you. The shortcomings in their broughtup and their lack of understanding on how to handle a different pov without being derogatory about it. Call me rebellious or insolent, but I have found the malady in all this. Guess what, it is not feminism or having a voice to convey my stance. It is your rigidity and ugly inneundo.Rest you can figure on your own what triggers you. one of the two small things you possess.) I can stoop to their level too but my arguments are NEVER based on personal remarks about uncontrollable factors unless attacked or provoked otherwise. I will continue to hit men where it hurts them the most. I am not a man hater but I am unapologetically vocal about the fact that I don't respect such species. Never have. Never will. Rant over!

". . POST 1 OF 2 - . . . . A long time ago My husband gave me a saying from one of Joel S. Goldsmiths books, that I took in to be a part of the fabric of myself. The Saying/ Statement is The only Power is the Power of God. The moment I heard this statement, I was about thirty at the time, the teenager inside of me rebelled against it. As a survivor of horrendous sexual abuse from my father and others, I could not shake my experience that Evil, the Dark Force, whatever you want to call it, did exist! That the Dark Forcehas the power to hurt us, to make us sick, to kill us, etc. That my father hurt me badly, so if there only was the power of God, how could that have happened? Where was Gods Power protecting me? How could I be wrong with all of the harm that people do to the Earth, and Animals, and each other! Yet something inside me knew it was the truth! Well Today the experience of the knowledge of this Statement Came to fruition! When I was Meditating and Praying this morning and Praying the Prayer  The only power is the power of God, all of a sudden I realized and experienced that this is A COMPLETELY REAL TRUTH , and there is NO OTHER REALITY! Think about it! ..... . . Cont. POST 2 NEXT POST W/ SAME PICTURE .. . . . tIreport .. . .",0,0

"For most of us, it is hard to fathom why women wouldn't be supportive. Men can make the workplace miserable for women, as countless stories attest. Then, there are other women. Along with where women report more rudeness from their female co-workers than male colleagues, show mothers, aunts, girlfriends and the like to tear each other down. Why do women do this to each other? - One part of it is that women often view other women as their competition. - Its also possible that breaking those stereotypical gender norms provokes incivility from other women. Women are supposed to be nurturing, kind, sweet, so when theyre more assertive, other women have a hard time accepting that, said Erika Holiday, a licensed clinical psychologist in Studio City, California, and co-author of Mean Girls, Meaner Understanding Why Women Backstab, Betray and Trash Talk Each Other and How to Heal. - Another explanation is that women often feel its safer to take out their aggression on other women than on men, Holiday added. Most women will tell you that they have survived at least one mean girl in their a girl who dismissed, put down, or even socially tormented them. Have you too survived this?

And tho I'm genuinely tired of all these reality tv shows that are not productive to WOC & much less our children; however, this season of has brought up a good point regarding ...& perhaps a bit of as well. I've thought in the past that Evelyn Lozada showcased a very HS mentality (that's probably becuz that's the highest level of achievement she's ever attained) as she gleefully attacks newcomers on the show. And tho, in the past I've thought that OG can be rather abrasive & arrogant, personality wise...she is no wallflower when it comes to defending herself. And I gotta say, I admire her for that. . Yes, her jabs could be a bit much...but she's right when she's pointed out to the executive producer that there have been women, like Evelyn, who have done physically far worse on the show than her threats. And yet, Evelyn seems to always get a pass. She gets praised & maybe even rewarded for her trashy behavior. Why is that? Is it becuz of a preference in skin tone? I can't honestly believe that the favoritism is alloted to mere friendship. Yeah, loyalty could very well be tied to ratings...but it just goes show...there is no honor among thieves. .

"Casual poser. A little bit of an essay today... with the intention of highlighting why harassment campaigns are so necessary. Last few days has been a bit of a trip with Catcalls account and a heightened gaggle of insane people out in full force. Had a day or two of slightly losing my shit. Alongside rape and ""I can ruin your life"" threats, my looks have been attacked, my size and weight have been torn apart and I've had my old address sent to me alongside a rape threat. Next to those, an overwhelming amount of belligerent douchebags requiring I justify every statement or choice of engagement. More hearteningly, were over a thousand messages of support from amazing people with stories about what the account means to them, which made my heart super happy. It's amazing how our self-worth can be challenged by complete strangers and also completely uplifted. The lesson learned from all of this however, is that my self-worth isn't attached to a bunch of awful people from the internet, but in the work that I'm doing and the incredible community that has been built around it. Every single one of the 342 messages of abuse I received in the course of 2 days are from someone's child, parent, sibling, co-worker, friend... maybe even you. When you dismiss the campaign you're dismissing that every single day womxn across the world are faced with harassment in all its forms - both out in the real world and online. We need to be shining a light on this kind of behaviour, and calling it out, educating our young and old alike that it is unacceptable. There need to be real life consequences that create a deterrent. And there needs to be a change in the conditions that allow this sort of behaviour to breed. And if you haven't already sign the damn petition in my bio. Love x",0,0

"Everyday sexism. Not a post I thought I'd be making today, but then two truck drivers hooted at me when I was running, making obscene gestures out of their windows. That happens to me a lot. So why not head this post with one of those sexist, narcissistic running selfies that are so popular on insta? It's 2019. We - at least we lucky ones in so-called civilised first world countries - have achieved gender equality. On paper at least. How is it still acceptable for men at an office to deny a female coworker's right to be angry by dismissing her as ""probably on her period""? How is it acceptable for a male coworker to be branded as ""probably gay"" because he is still a bachelor at 50? So what if he is? Why do we still need to reduce people to their genitals to be comfortable with their identity? How can the car salesman sell me a car that I have picked, tested and paid for with my own money that I earned in my own job and still treat my husband like he just generously gifted his little wifey a car? How come my neighbour comes over when I cut the hedge to ask my why ""the master"" (!) isn't doing it? How come when i open my car's bonnet to check the oil, I'm still immediately surrounded by men trying to mansplain to me what I need to do? How come the mechanic can tell me to let my husband check then engine when it acts up (fun he doesn't even know how to open the bonnet)? I'm not an angry person, and I don't usually stand on soap boxes. All these incidents pass, and I brush them off as they happen. But something is still very wrong in this society. And it makes me angry to see people being reduced to what they carry between their legs. My neighbour was just trying to be nice. My coworkers aren't homophobic. The truckers were appreciative of my butt (I assume). The salesman thought he was just doing his job. The guys offering to check my oil wanted to help. And yet, all of them rankled.

"youre a WOMAN, you have to be MODEST & DEVOTED to one man this is what I got to read under my last post yesterday.  I never really thought that having sex as a woman would be something that insults other men but OH was I wrong.

Also, 85% of you have been called SLUT or WHORE too - as my little survey in my stories showed. What a fucked up world, what a fucked up society for slut-shaming women.  Were not less precious just because we had sex with men BEFORE we got married. Were not less precious just because were living OUR life as WE want it. I speak up for ALL who ever have been slut-shamed. I want YOU to know that YOURE A WOMAN and that you can live an independent life. Its not only about sex but also your whole life; dont let society tell you what to do; if you dont want to have kids and prefer focusing on your career- THEN DO IT!

As sex workers we are constantly excluded from conversations about our work and as human beings we are othered and aliened from general society. . . Even as said society worships our ideals, I find myself exhausted and run down more than I care to admit. Shame, stigma, fear, violence all of the destructive and abusive interactions can be boiled down to the fact that we do not allow ourselves to have a nuanced perspective on our own sexuality. We project! We Attack those we wish to emulate! I cant even count how many times I was taught and did enforce sexism and self censorship myself in my younger days. . . My sexuality and my body (nude or not) gives me strength, and power, and people seek out my time to bask in that energy. Constantly making me censor my own body only reminds me of how dangerous the world sees me. This fear allows them to take away our rights and demonize our actions while they continue to see us in private. This post is all over the place because I am venting, and feeling sad after a bad shift. . . . . Photography . . . . Please comment about any pent up BS about censorship of you or your art or your favorite artists. . . . .",0,0

" - 2016 - SINGAPORE (Toastmasters). About a year ago I decided to dip my toes into the public speaking space. I joined toastmasters in Singapore and even won a few table talk competitions. My rambles were not prepared and it was painfully obvious. I was entertaining rather than conveying a message. There really wasn't a start, middle, or end. Forget about structure. fast forward to 2017 - CHICAGO (open mic night). Last night, I joined a dear friend for a storytelling event in Chicago. I purposefully arrived AFTER the open mic portion thinking I'd hide out in the back and just be an observer. (Anyone who has spent 5 minutes with me can find the humour in that last sentence ). I didn't want to speak. I wanted to be invisible. I couldn't breath and just needed more than anything to be close to good energy. I needed a distraction from processing my own garbage. As it turns out the Universe had a different agenda. The host was short open mic volunteers. *Weakness* I've never been able to turn down an opportunity to be helpful. I agreed to help then asked if there was a theme. Dark. Time. 8 minutes. Huh? This is a joke right? The first open mic person talks about work and dealing with a director of marketing. She references the internal monologue of WTF but the PR voice of 'no problem, we can do it this way.' And a mention of leaves vs leafs. Communication. Effective communication.  The second speaker talks about family. A relationship between sisters and black magic curses. Children being used as tools. A Father climbing a mountain. Forgiveness for wrongdoing. The host takes the stage and shares a story of his Best Friend and how befriending an atheist helped him on his spiritual journey. His Friend committed suicide by setting himself on fire.  I see the signals from Angels. I feel blessed that I'm exactly where I'm meant to be. I know without hesitation the story on my heart.",0,0

"I ""experted"" for Annakeara Stinson's piece on toxic masculinity, a term which in my view is often assumed to refer to the most debased of actions like rape, sexual harassment, violence, aggression, and which sometimes includes the ""boys will be boys"" explanation for a whole range of behaviors. But the way I see it, so often it is our more subtle everyday actions and beliefs that underpin this toxic system and which we need to consider. These are things like the view that women are just better care givers than men, or that men are less emotional than women, or that it would be weird for a woman to pay on a date with a man, since that is how women know men are interested, and then there is common defense of chivalry as a cherished tradition by caring men who just want to protect women. These are forms of benevolent sexism and they uphold a deeply entrenched system that divides behaviors and characteristics into male and female and then punishes anyone who strays from this binary script. So while many people are comfortable addressing the more obvious forms of toxicity, since so much benevolent sexism is presented as complimentary to women and is often supported by them, it is a lot harder to critique without being seen as petty or reactionary. But defaulting to this view is a slippery slope that then allows us to support increasingly hostile actions and makes us less likely to fight against gender based injustice overall. So I talk about that here. Link in bio.",1,1

She exuded confidence unlike anyone I've ever seen, but her stage presence isn't even what impressed me the most... . Cher kicked off the show with a personal story, filled with words of encouragement to all women.

She told the audience she keeps performing to show girls out there that they DO NOT have to meet societys timeline or expectations. That its NEVER too late to pursue your dreams.

"In recent years, feminist movements have attracted significant attention in Europe and North America. So why do so many young women still say they do not identify with the term? Fewer than one in five young women would call themselves a feminist, polling in the UK and US suggests. That might come as a surprise to some, as feminism has seemingly been steadily gaining mainstream attention lately. So it is perhaps unexpected that the identity ""feminist"" has not gained more popularity among young women in the Western world. Across Europe, fewer than half of men and women polled in five countries agreed they were a feminist. This ranged from 8% of respondents in Germany, to 40% in Sweden. However, people do not appear to reject the term feminism because they are against gender equality or believe it has been achieved. The same study found that eight out of 10 people said men and women should be treated equally in every way. If many believe gender equality is important, and still lacking, then why do relatively few people - including young women - identify as feminist?It could be that they do not feel the term speaks to them. The term feminist is less likely to appeal to working-class women, polls suggest. One-in-three women in higher income brackets identify as feminists while one-in-five women in lower income homes reject the label outright. These same women say they support gender equality but don't see the feminist movement as particularly helpful or relevant to them. Research into the views of US millennials found 12% of Hispanic women, 21% of African American women, 23% of Asian women and 26% of white women identify as a feminist. Many of those polled said they felt feminism had been helpful to white women but not to other minority groups. The greatest factor involved in women rejecting the feminist label however, are the negative connotations associated with it. Many of the women polled see feminism as associated with lack of femininity and synonymous with man-hating. These negative connotations have been fueled by the actions of the feminist movement itself. The image of feminism will improve only when feminists themselves decide to change for the better.",0,0

"The majority of us love fashion, in one way or another. We love the playful new trends that we can experiment with every season, the works of art that designers want to encourage us to wear, and the excitement of seeing our personalities in a given dress. While some would like to write off fashion as being something materialistic, we think its something that we create an intense, emotional bond with. It becomes apart of us. Fashion reveals a part of our personalities before we even say our first ""hello,"" and it develops and changes as we grow. It's pieces of who we are and who we wish we were, as well as people we admire and want to emulate. Like wearing a bold red lipstick because thats what our mother wore at our age. Or high waist skirt because thats what that one fabulous girl wore on the other side of the crosswalk. It lets you put your hands around art and beauty, and allows you to be playful even when your day is over-stressed with routine and schedules. Its an important part of our lives and  for us so that is why we decided to start page to help other girls who like us are fans of fashion, latest trends of skin, cloths or even places to go too .

"Three years ago I was asked to speak to a large group of Military personnel on sexual assault exams. While it was an incredible honor to be standing in front of a group of the bravest men/women I will ever meet, a part of me didnt want to be there. I didnt want a story to tell of sitting through a 3.5 hour grueling rape exam only to find out almost a year after that day, that the SANE (sexual assault nurse examiner) hadnt kept the only evidence that could have been used. Because of her actions, he walked. But this IS my story now, and I will tell it whenever and wherever I am asked. Because if telling this prevents just one woman from feeling the abject devastation and hopelessness I felt, then my journey will have a purpose. October 2016 When I was planning out my future, it didn't include doing being a guest speaker at classes for sexual assault examiners. But life has a funny way stepping in, completely destroying our plans, and disappearing. And we are left with pieces of our lives scattered all around us and we sit among the mess, frantically searching for every last piece and we try and force them back into the spaces they left, but they no longer fit and there are so many missing. And this is it - this is the point of no return. For you will do one of two things, you will lie down with your broken pieces and cling to them, or you will collect the ones you can and start on your new plan. This is part of my new plan. And it's only possible because of the ones who helped me pick up my pieces and put my life back together. And while it isn't the future I planned, I am taking it and making it mine!",0,0
"At Transformational Gangstas, we are pulling back the mask and uncovering some misconceptions about and sharing what it really looks like. Well, first off, there is no one face of domestic violence. It can look like your neighbor, student, friend, family member, teacher, pet and you still living in it or haunting you from your past. According to psychology today, more than 38 million American Women have been victims of domestic violence. . While domestic violence affects people from every background, and the LGBTQ community is largly overlooked since the misconception is that it is a man against woman epidemic. It also goes well beyond physical violence. It can show behind so many masks. Its hidden behind fear and control. This out of control form of control shows up in the forms of physical, emotional, mental, economic, spiritual and technological abuse. Many abusers not only threaten their victims but their victims family members as well. Speak up for all of those who are behind the mask. Break the Omert and BREAK-FREE from the silence.",0,0

"It breaks my heart. Each and every time those sexist comments just make me cry, make me roar. Today a girl cried for a very small reason, but sufficient enough to make her ineligible for a job. Few guys started mocking, ""Oh it must be a girl.Else why will someone cry over such a small thing!!"" But did they even for once consider her set of issues. The hardwork she put in to even get to that platform. She might be scared to lose that chance. She might have family issues that make it necessary for her to grab that one opportunity. You really don't know her story. But it just took you seconds to judge her and pass a comment just like that. Why!!! Why!!! When are we going to change? When are we going to learn basic humanity?

"**BOOK  I have now finished reading Raising girls by Steve Biddulph. Overall, I enjoyed this book from start to finish. The book is easy to read and does not necessarily need to be read in order of front to back. The chapters tackle various topics which will arise as our daughter grows up. The first section focuses on 5 stages of girlhood (from birth to 18 years old). The book gives advice on what girls need based upon their development stage. In this section, the book gives advice on how to help our daughter; be secure, learn to explore, relate to others, find her soul/self, and take charge of her life. Section 1 is good, but this information is echoed throughout psychology and many books. It is section 2 which makes this book stand out for me. Section 2 contains the updated challenges of this modern society. Things which are not necessarily covered in the classic child development studies. The chalenges are; The rush were all in. The importance of making time for our children in the modern working world. Too sexy too soon. The sexualisation of young girls from an earlier age than ever before. It looks at media coverage, pornography, boys, the movement, and taking control of her own sex life in a healthy way. Mean girls. Bullying, which for girls tends to be relational, rather than physical (Social exclusion and emotional abuse). Cyberbullying and how important it is for bystanders to interject when they see bullying. Bodies, weight and food. Eating disorders, dieting, and self harm. Alcohol and other drugs. Prepare and protect against alcohol and drug misuse. *See my post the other day regarding Esthers law for an example* Mirror, mirror on the screen. Social media and the pitfalls. Rise in suicide rates since the boom of smart phones, the poisonous need for social acceptance online, and how to help our vulnerable daughters. The book ends with section 3. This section talks about the individual roles of the parents. What girls need from their mother, father and step parents etc. I would thoroughly recommend this book if you are having a daughter.",0,0

"TW rape / abortion . I had wings, once, and they were strong. But they were stolen from me. They could carry me above the clouds and into the headwinds, and they never faltered. Not even once. Imagine you go to see a friend, and while in their company, you start feeling off before blacking out. When you come to, its obvious what has happened to you, and what you went through. You feel dirty, you blame yourself, and you try to pretend it never happened. Cut to a couple months later when you find out youre pregnant with your rapists baby. Now imagine that you would get more prison time for aborting that baby than your rapist would for abusing, using, and taking advantage of your body. THIS IS HAPPENING IN AMERICA. THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW TO REAL WOMEN. I recently read that a pregnant woman who got shot in the stomach is being charged for the death of her fetus. This is not right and it is not normal.

"I write a post about body acceptance, paired with a photo of my body in semi-revealing clothing, and there's always a man leaving a comment about how sexy I am. . I check my inbox and there's a sleazy dude telling me that I'm hot, and another one sending me a dick pic. . I had one guy constantly leaving comments on my posts about how sexy I am and that I should keep gaining weight. Obviously not because he thought it'd be healthy, but because he would find me even sexier then. Another guy told me he was ""stroking his dick to my fine ass"". Barf. . I haven't asked for these comments, but I know it's a common reaction from other people when you complain about sleazy ""If you don't want these comments, why do you post such sexual photos?"" . Well. . I do it for myself, to force myself to see my body as it really is and accept that fact. I do it to expose myself, because exposure is an important part of BDD recovery. I also do it for anyone out there struggling to love or accept their body, to show them that all bodies are good bodies, whether thin or fat, curvy or straight, full of cellulite or scarred or hairy. . I don't do it for these men. Their opinions about my body aren't welcome because my body acceptance journey isn't to be fetishized. . I know perfectly that it's unavoidable that people will feel attraction to you. But the behavior of these guys go beyond attraction- it's a power thing. Men reduce women/people they perceive as women to sexual objects as a manifestation of the power they hold in our society. And people only run the errands of the patriarchy when they blame or slutshame those of us who wear that short skirt or post that half-naked pic. . So how do I handle this? . Well, I block all men leaving sleazy comments + profiles that seem creepy as prevention. I suggest you either do the same or if you have the energy, tell them why their behavior isn't okay. Some men are completely ignorant but I don't believe all are. They can rewire their brains and learn basic politeness and respect. It's not in their biology, it's in the excuses we make for them based on that idea. . Have you received similar comments? How do you respond to creepy men?",0,0

"This is Megan Fox (). She is a actress and a model. She was in a lot of bluckbuster in the 2000's and at the start of the 2010's, and is known for her role's in movies such as Transformers or Jennifer's Body. Recently, I came upon an artcile about her, saying that she was one of the biggest victim of sexism in Hollywood, showing example of how. In every interviews she is doing, people only talk to her about her body, how she is the most beautiful woman in the world, that everyone is in love with her. They don't talk to her about the movie, or anything else than her being sexy. They don't see her for her work but only for what she look like and sexualize her for it. What happened to her, will probably not happened today, or not as much as she had to go through. But the fact that she had to, without anyone defending her or even just saying how rude, unprofessional and sexist it is to talk to a person like this, amaze me. The worst in this case, is that she once said that even though she had stories to tell and could have shared them during the movement, she didn't do it, cause she felt that her stories weren't worth. Because she was ""the most beautiful woman in the world"". What was taught to her is that, because she is pretty in the eyes of many she didn't had a word to say, she was lucky to be beautiful and literally being the object of desir for many. This is also why we need equally with every gender but also in the gender itself. Because there are many women like Megan Fox, that were told that because they were beautiful, they should be happy about being desired and sexualized by men and women. And that they shouldn't complained, because many wish they could be like them. Even if she didn't told everything that happened to her, Megan Fox shared things, like the time when the director Michael Bay made her do an audition at his house, by washing his car in a bikini, while he was recording her. She also talks about how she was ahead of time, and how she was hate then for what women are praised now. If you want equallity, you have to fight for everyone, even the one that look like what society is telling us to look like. xxZ",0,0

"*POLICING WOMEN'S BODIES + DRESS CODE IN BEIRUT* A couple months ago, while traveling in Tunisia, I had a few people in my DMs who tried to sl*t-shame me for wearing sleeveless clothing in a Muslim country. But little did they know that a sizeable number of the local ladies in Tunis and La Marsa were far worse not only were they out in the streets with bare shoulders (the only reason I dared to show my own), but they were also wearing short skirts, crop tops, and even bikinis on the beach. While I was surprised, it was a good reminder that the culture of a specific place isn't monolithic and what is deemed ""acceptable"" is always evolving. The comments I received were also a reminder of how quick we are to judge/condemn women for their wardrobe choices without having a complete picture or up to date knowledge of a place or space. Beirut is widely considered to be the fashion capital of the Middle East and pretty much anything goes for women in terms of hemlines are high, silhouettes are slinky, and hair is in full view for those who choose. This is due in part to the varied religious makeup of Lebanon-- many are surprised to learn that only about 55% of the population is Muslim, while nearly 40% is Christian. This is why, while I took care to dress conservatively when it was required and always carried a pashmina in the event I was wearing something sleeveless, I also rocked my short summer dresses without stares or incident. Bottom line-- educate yourself about dress code when you travel to ensure that you are following cultural norms and expectations. Respect is always key. But when in Rome-- or in this case Beirut or Tunis-- it's possible to do as the locals do. Also-- in general it's always better to ASK a clarifying question to than to ASSUME, ACCUSE, or ATTACK. Take a breath and inform yourself before judging a so-called ""offender""-- it may turn out that YOU'RE actually the one being offensive. Ladies, have you ever been judged/shamed for your clothing?",0,0

He didnt like the suit because it didnt accentuate my assets. And Im sure he hated seeing a young women not looking 100% feminine. . Let me be clear, I am not a product to be consumed.

"Cyntoia Brown-Long was arrested in 2004 at age 16 after killing a 43-year-old man who had bought her for sex. She said she acted in self defense, fearing for her life, but she was tried as an adult and ultimately convicted of first-degree murder, getting a life sentence. Brown-Long appealed her sentence multiple times, but those appeals were repeatedly denied. However, her story took a turn when news coverage of her case went viral over the last few years. Just before filing for clemency in December of 2017, her story spread online and led to a massive social media campaign calling for her freedom, garnering support from major celebrities like Rihanna and Kim Kardashian West. ""Overnight, it just blew up. It spread like wildfire,"" she says. ""It's really nothing short of a miracle from God, the way that so many people around the world were just rallying for me to be freed."" Brown-Long was granted clemency by Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam in January of this year, and she walked free on Aug. 7 after 15 years behind bars.

"Everyday Sexism by Laura Bates  This amazing piece of feminist literature is based on a project called Everyday Sexism. Hundreds of women, and even more unfortunately, girls, wrote in to share their experiences of sexual abuse, catcalling, physical abuse, and pure fear, which they have experienced, simply due to being female. These included in the family home, school, work and just on the street.   This book is one that will stay with me forever, and that I think everyone should read. I have only knocked it a star because sometimes I found it so hard to read, but pushed myself as I think its so important. Feminism is something that many people have strong feelings about.

"Happy World Sexual Health Month! Let's talk about sex-positivity! Sexual positivity promotes the view that sex is healthy for people and that people can experience their sexuality however they like, so long as they engage in safe and consensual practices. Being sex-positive means respecting the sexual freedom, choices and lifestyles of others. It eradicates any hierarchies that assert one kind of sexual practice as better or more righteous than another. Our culture can be a very sex-negative one in which, rather than allowing people to bond over something they all enjoy, social norms favor the act of putting others down for having sex. This is also known as slut-shaming. Theres a tendency to make moral judgments about individuals, mostly women, who have sex, especially if they do it too often.  Polyamory isnt monogamy and it isnt swinging, its being open to having loving relationships with different people of different sexes at the same time, and in that way learning to love yourself, too.

"r*pe  i am so fucking sick and tired of victim blaming.  i recently watched a documentary about crime in london. one of the cases involved a woman who had been raped whilst on her way home from a night out. the man who raped her threatened to kill her. she thought she was going to die.  eventually, she escaped, got on a bus, and called the police. when the police arrived, she was distraught. not only because of the terrible things that she had survived, but because she had been drinking that night.  no ones going to believe me, because im drunk!  and my heart broke for her. because the reality is that most people probably wont believe her.  we have cultivated a culture in which we dont believe rape survivors. this case is one of thousands across the world. and it needs to change.  the process of reporting sexual assault is so traumatic that most survivors choose not to. and so if someone has found the courage to come forward, then it is VITAL that we support them.  false accusations only make up 2-10% of all cases. this means that it is FAR more likely for a rape accusation to be true. and by claiming that they are lying, we helping build a misogynistic environment in which people are scared to come forward.  feeling safe from assault is a right. and so is being believed when you report it.

"I needed a breather before continuing on my series on . Before I move on to my next life experience which mirrors this tv series, I want to write about how . Once I saw that it was a pattern for boys to paint my character in red whenever I said no, I figured nothing was wrong with me. It's who they are. Lying made them feel masculine. Just so that if anyone told them, ""hey I heard Debosmita said no to you"", they could retort ""I was never interested, she is that type of girl"". Of course it wasn't easy. It took me most part of my plus two to regain confidence in me. I knew who I was. My close friends knew who I was. I stopped caring about what rest of the world thought. Next time I heard a similar story, I would remind myself, that those were silly distractions. It was ironical how everybody would think I was this 'modern' girl with 'loose morals' when in fact I used to be very prudish. I hadn't held hands with a boy, let alone kiss or do anything more physical with anybody. I knew I had to ignore them to preserve my sanity. I had my competitive examinations for law school admission coming up. I had my plus two board examinations ahead. I shut my ears and eyes and poured myself into studies. It was my way to cope. You can engage in a hobby, or music, or travelling, or yoga or just about anything to cope with such times. Just know you are not who they say you are. You are who you know you are. No one in the world can take away that from you, come what may.",0,0

"Arousal Non-concordance.   Listen to her words. At a recent workshop I attended, explained arousal non-concordance Genital response is an automatic response unrelated to whether or not we want something. Pleasure happens, desire happens, arousal happens, and then theres consent. Listen to what she says.   Sexual stimulation and genital response do not equate to a desire for sex. Our bodies can be turned on when our minds are not. This is called  -.   The physiological responses of arousal are great but if she/he/they say no, that means sex is not wanted.   Many of us werent taught agency or autonomy growing up. Many of us werent taught to listen to our inner voices, the voice that says no, yes, maybe, lets wait and see. Were taught to believe that other people know better. Were taught we should want differently, that we should just go along with it. That other peoples wants and needs supercede our own.   Fuck.

What do we think? Reporting of sexual harassment in coast guard cadets has gone up significantly this year (from reporting in 2016 of 36% to this year 45% of women saying they've experienced sexual harassment).   What do you think this means?  (a) There's more sexual harassment happening now. (b) More women are being honest in reporting their experiences. (c) More women understand what sexual harassment is and are able to report more accurately.  I'm always curious whether we should take higher reporting rates as a good thing or a bad thing.

For many, this movement felt like the first time survivors and victims of sexual violence could speak up and actually be heard. It is detrimental to immediately align this page with Ms. Burkes work, which is why in proper childlike jargon, the page was named Me First. The hashtag went viral (2 years ago this week!) when women in Hollywood began using it to call out sexual misconduct that was linked to an abuse of power. While it was exciting to see a conversation about sexual abuse gaining traction, I felt that survivors of childhood sexual abuse were still being unheard. During my senior year, I was fortunate enough to listen Ms. Burke speak and meet her briefly. I nervously rambled a thank you, told her she inspired me, and mentioned that I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse. She remained composed while I was frazzled, she listened, and she said, me too. Thank you, Tarana Burke, for creating this movement and being a pioneer of this crucial conversation.

"Two Italian postgraduates high-five each other after raping a drunk woman A public camera outside of a night club in London captured two young Italian men laughing and high-fiving after they both raped a young woman in the maintenance room and left her bleeding with an unusually severe injury. Ferdinando Orlando and Lorenzo Costanzo also appear on CCTV footage from inside the night club, flirting with the victim on the dance floor. They can be seen [passing] her from [one to the] other, each of them taking it in turns to kiss her, prosecutor Allison Hunter says, then they lead the woman, who is very drunk and can hardly stand, to the maintenance room. Sixteen minutes later, they emerge with the woman, and Orlando can be seen re-arranging her dress. She says she does not remember anything from that night, except being alone, bleeding on the street. Orlando and Costanzo were convicted after prosecutors argued that the victim was too drunk to consent.",0,0

If you find the Grasshopper as your totem animal, it means that you are ready to use any opportunity in front of you.

"""Few weeks ago, I met a male friend at a cafe. When we went to pay up for our drinks, my friend had some loose change, but I had a 500 rupee note, I asked my friend to give me his share and I paid the bill for the both of us. We had this conversation in front of the cashier, who saw the exchange of money happen as well. I paid her the money, but when it came to returning the remaining amount and giving the bill, she gave *both* to my male friend despite me clearly stating ""Please give me the change."" It felt like a classic case of people assuming that if a girl and a boy are out together, the boy has got to be the one paying the bill, or is somehow the one in charge. Common as such incidents may be, they highlight the underlying issue of casual sexism being normalised in our society. The very assumption that if a man and a woman are out together, the man is the one necessarily providing for the woman, by paying her bills, is not only demeaning to the woman, by undervaluing her status of being someone who can look after herself, and pay for herself, but it also places an unfair burden on the man to be the one providing/paying for a woman, while she can look after herself. Sexism, like most social evils isn't always necessarily blatant. It creeps in little ways like these, where it becomes easier to brush off the problem and say ""Esa to hota hai"" instead of confronting it, because who wants to pick up a fight on something seemingly petty?"" . . . .",1,1

"Here is your daily reminder that women can wear whatever they want and still be worthy of respect. The amount of clothes on our bodies does not determine our worth or value. They do not dictate what is acceptable or unacceptable behavior by others. Despite what some may think, its not an external cry for attention or need to be validated by those around us. Perhaps, women simply feel strong enough in who they are to make decisions about how they show up in the world. And, unfortunately, we live in a society that has been taught to be uncomfortable by strong, powerful, independent women who choose to pave their own path. So, to all the women out Never let anyone devalue you or make you feel small for simply living your life in a way that is true and authentic to you. Someone elses disapproval is not your problem. Its not your responsibility to be what society deems acceptable. To anyone who has ever slut shamed a women, rolled their eyes at the amount of skin they saw, or believed the lie that her worth or self-respect was dictated by the amount of clothes on her body, PLEASE STOP! Choose kindness. Choose love. Choose acceptance. Choose empowerment. Choose to encourage others to be THEMSELVES! Not the version of themselves that you find acceptable. Those who shame others, either implicitly or explicitly, do not have power over us! Please remember that you are strong enough to disagree. Your opinions are valid. YOU MATTER! Get to know who you are, what you think, and how you believe. Then stand in your truth. The stronger you are, the harder it will be for others to knock you down ",1,1

"WHO ELSE FINDS IT HARD TO GET PLEASURE FROM PENETRATING I really want to know, because this is a block Ive had for a long time. And its not just in relation to toys. Thing is; I can physically DO it, but I dont feel anything when I do. - Even penetrating myself with fingers, I cant do it without my body (pussy) tensing up and shutting down. Which is why I know that its performative when I do it FOR my partners. Its for the pornifed male gaze, which is where I first got sold the idea of what my pleasure should look like. - Intentional penetration with a partner (them penetrating me with either penis, fingers, or toys) is one of the best feelings ever for me, so Im really committed to uncovering why I cant do it FOR and TO myself. I dont feel any pleasure from it, nothing at all. - I wonder if my pussy is holding onto some trauma that needs to be worked through? To be honest I think this might very well be the case, along with some subconscious messaging (internalised misogyny) Im holding onto. Could it be the belief that real sex is penetration and that can only be an actual penis in vagina? - But I really want to hear from you, if youre comfortable sharing your experiences with me of course.

"SEXUAL ASSAULT/HARASSMENT/RAPE I want to put my story out so that many others can be careful. I was 14, a freshman in high school. I had no friends, and i never talked. The only class i enjoyed was Gym, because i play sports. Now after a few weeks in school, i played soccer by myself, kicking the ball into a wall and such. One day, a guys kicks his ball over to me, and i kick it back. We started playing everyday. I was glad to have a friend. The few new friends i had told me to be careful, hes a senior. I just shrugged it off. Im gay, and he knew it. He would never try anything. He gave me his instagram, and we talked. A lot. We even started hanging out during lunch. After maybe 3 months of being in school, one day, Ill never forget. He just randomly, out of no where, pushed me, and pinned me to the wall. He asked ""can i kiss you?"" And i said no, you know I dont like guys. He didnt care. He did it anyways. My first kiss. Not only did he kiss me, he had his hand around my neck so i couldnt move. I was too scared to scream. He was touching me everywhere. Places i never wanted him to. Finally a teacher came, and i got so scared i ran away. I never talked to him again, but in gym class everyday, he would find a way to touch me. No matter how hard i tried to stay away. Turns out he and his friends were competing to see how many freshmen they could ""get."" I just wanted to put this out there as a warning to new freshman.

"""Lawyer advises young peers to stick a fork in client's hand if sexually harassed."" That's one piece of advice . . . . In my view, the problem with it isn't just that it sounds silly and could get the victim arrested.   It also misses that a lot of sexual harassment does not involve any kind of physical contact or physical threat (or at least doesn't start out that way).   It misses that a lot of sexual harassment is targeted at women because they are women and has nothing to do with sexual advances.   It misses that a lot of people would never commit violence, even when they experience violence . . . and that they are reasonable, smart people.  It misses that there are thousands of responses to sexual harassment that shuts it down and creates a safe environment.  It misses that many people do not carry forks with them to work and a lot of sexual harassment happens away from the dinner table.   So, what's your go-to response to harassment? Mine is typically humor. A client I had liked to say she needed a moment and walk away. What do you do when someone is acting inappropriately?  ",0,0

And was elected as the ""influenceur of the year"" by Cosmopolitain, in 2019 for a reason. I think she is a true model and an inspiration for many. At only 20 years old, she already has a big community and shares daily messages about how to love yourself, get ride of abbusive people in your life and how to not give a damn, about what other people may tell you. She also encourages women, by empowering them on their sexuallity, and how society as taught women that they should be ashamed of it. She is one of those women, that you look up too. She has a business at only 20, is someone always positive in what she shares, she fights for minorities, empowers people, and make them remember that they should never settle for something, that don't deserve them. She is also, a true fashion icon. She is part of the queer community, and share things about it, to show people that your sexuality is your choice, and that you should never be shamed for it. With everything she shares, she truly empowers people to love themselves, be themselves and being proud of it. We often talk about only following people, who inspire and empower you, to be the best verison of yourself and only make you feel good. Florence Given, is definitely one of them. xxZ",0,0

"Slut is attacking women for their right to say Yes  I recently read that somewhere and it really hit home with me. I grew up in a world that made me question any sexual desire I had, any sensual impulse, anything that I felt could be deemed provocative in my culture. This stuff ran so deep and trust me when I say the self loathing and fear was ingrained as I was made to believe that by feeling sexual in any way, I was asking to be labeled a Slut. That there was something wrong with me inherently. But I was a young woman and I felt the urge just as everyone else did. This led to many years of exploring my sexuality in the strangest ways, sometimes bursting through the repression in the worst ways, a lot of the times just absolutely closing myself off to any possibility, and a few times judging other women for being easy so as to disguise my own insecurities and pretending I had it all figured out. I didnt. I still dont, to a degree, but I no longer chastise myself either. And what Ive found is that its so healthy and necessary to be open with myself, to understand myself. I wish Id learnt that when I was younger. As a woman, I have every right to explore my own sensuality and thrive in that feeling. Its such an essential part of the human experience that Id let fear and judgment stifle for so long, limiting my own life experiences. My body and my right to say yes are mine and mine alone.",1,1

"Gray suit. If youve experienced abuse or trauma, you may develop a sense of disconnectedness from things youd normally enjoy (especially when you feel like no one understands why youre suffering). You may also become disconnected from your routines like eating, showering, going outside, answering messages, checking email, or even going to work. (Yes. Even things you need in order to stay alive). Sometimes even the littlest perceived benefit to yourself will still seem evil and threatening. Society misunderstands further when people make fun of survivors who engage in self-care, thinking its just an excuse to walk a dog, do yoga, or take an extra break during the day at work. Self-care isnt about treating yourself when you need some comfort, its about relearning your brain chemistry and redirecting the trauma energy (the same energy it took to overcome the most impossible situations of your life) into a positive thought or process rather than a destructive thought/behavior (like suicide). Id much rather be walking my dog these days than contemplating suicide. Mental disorders are not weaknesses. The warrior within still lives. Find listening ears. Tell your story.",0,0

I was visiting her and her family at their farm in upstate NY and one afternoon she and I were in a field, listening to music, shooting, talking and this moment happened - a young woman who was completely lost in her own world, not performing for any gaze, but rather, celebrating her womanhood and embracing her own power as a women. In 2016 I posted this image on Instagram. And it was censored. I was stunned, and then outraged, especially considering some of the imagery that shows up in my feed and in the discovery section. To each their own, but naked women posing for men are fine, but this image, this needs to be censored? It felt like Instagram was telling women that their bodies are shameful, unless they are being used for the purposes of male satisfaction and that their womanhood should not be celebrated. And I reposted the image saying just that. The image was removed again and my account was immediately blacklisted and buried in the algorithm. Overnight my account became invisible. Its been that way ever since. Now, I have never really put a whole lot of stock in the whole Insta fame world and I dont particularly care. However, Instagram is a publishing house now and like it or not, as a photographer a lot of my jobs come down to clients looking at my Instagram - brands will or will not hire you based on your follower count and interactions.

"TEARS OF JOY I cry as I listen to the videos of Asian American, Chanel Miller, reveal her story from rape to recovery. Its a joyful cry. When people muster the courage (particularly Asian woman - such a rare instance) to stand up for themselves and others, I am so proud of them. In the Asian Culture, you are NOT taught to be different, individual and to question authority, its the opposite. Soto see Chanel speak out is a bigger obstacle than someone else. I am proud everyone no matter who they are for speaking up, just to clear. What is it like to be in the media for a negative event? Stressful, not fun, and overwhelming. Strangers who don't know you are mad at you. Your environment turns dark, when you are used to lighting up the room. She seems like an introvert, but this was my experience in 2001-2002. As an Asian American, we need to see Asians Americans speak up and be heard. Shout out to takei for raising awareness of many humanity issues and also joyful stories. ""Emily Doe"" was raped by a Stanford, Olympic bound, white, male student, Brock Turner. She pressed charges and stayed anonymous until now. Chanel's impact statement went viral with 15 million views around the world in 6 days. She changed California law from the outrage of the offender only getting 3 months instead of 14 years for raping an unconscious woman. The people rallied to get Judge Persky recalled for the weak sentence. As I watch her sharing how she made to feel like the offender, I remember I was made to feel guilty when my perpetrator hired a private detective made me feel like I did something wrong, when the detective's client was the one who committed a crime. (I was not raped.) What can you do besides reading and watching along? Share these stories? Believe them and tell the people who share them that you believe them. Talk about it. Raise awareness. Try to understand what they are going through. Being a victim is isolating and you get used to people not believing you. Be the that person that listens, cares and supports. See video .",0,0

Load as much power as possible behind your fist, knees and feet 5. Arm yourself. Find the weapon you are most adept with (bear spray, tactical pen, knife, gun, etc). Study the laws for your weapon.

This book by Jason Hanson is FULL of information to identify threats, make yourself less of a target, and avoid dangerous situations. 7. Take photographs. When Im running, I take a photo of any strangely acting person or vehicle and text it to my husband. This is a simple way to make the person aware youve noticed them, show youre not an easy target, alert a third party you may be in danger, and provide a photo for the police should the worst happen. 8.

"Jesy Nelson   In light of the recent documentary on BBC that revolved around the story of from being cyber-bullied to the point of a suicide attempt, I thought it was appropriate to highlight my post 'Why You Don't Get To Comment On Her Body' (LINK IN BIO).  After watching the documentary myself, I didn't feel angry like I thought I would, I felt sad and disappointed. Jesy is a beautiful young woman with a smile that radiates pure sunshine, why anyone felt the need to shame her, I don't know.  I'm fed up of seeing fat-shaming, skinny-shaming, slut-shaming and all other forms of shaming become a normal part of everyday life when online. I have had to start taking time off social media because it has impacted on my mental health in a detrimental way. Unfortunately, my blog and writing/editing career both rely on social media so I do have to be present.  What does anyone have to gain by spreading hate? Just be a bit kinder it isn't that hard or better yet keep it shut and don't comment at all.  If you're not going to spread love and light today, at least try not to be a complete arsehole.  ",0,0

"Sexism in school plays. Hmmmm. Last Friday I went to my niece's school play where they performed a modern tribute to Shakespeare - rapping, funny dancing, etc. You get the deal. An early plot was the fact that women weren't allowed to act, so some pretended to be men so they could. Ahh! I thought excitedly. This will be a wonderful demonstration of how boys and girls should be treated equally, demonstrating the ridiculous of historic sexism. Except it wasn't. Top three things that pissed me 1. Essex girl jokes 2. Getting 10 and 11 year olds to sing about how to be a girl with the words...and the miming...""wax your legs and stick out your chest"" 3. I hoped this was ironic. Setting me up to have my indignant state punctured. But no, the next scene was about trying to identify who the female actors were and this was achieved by waving a pair of high heels and all the girls getting giggly, chasing after them, and saying how beautiful they were.

"Dolls Arent Just For Girls PLEASE SHARE!! This week I set out to find Harley a doll or buba as he calls them! This is what I found......swipe for videos! 2019 and the shops still have a clear girls section and boys section! The most boyish dolls I could find were still in pinkish clothing and in pink boxes with girls on the boxes and in a completely pink aisle. The accessory section where you could get toy prams/high chairs/cribs and bits were all pink and not one box had a boy on it! They are all clearly aimed as girls toys! Can a boy not have a doll? Can a boy not have a toy pram? If you go by the adverts in these shops then no! Im not saying boys cant have pink, I dress Harley in pink BUT I dont understand if the stores still insist on having a clear divide in the sections cant there be a baby bit in the boy aisle? Cant there be a range out there where theres a boy doll in grey or white? Something completely neutral? Cant there be a boy on the packaging?

"Still relevant today as it was 2 yrs ago on 10182017 when I posted the below... The Rebirth Imagine being 7 & enduring the unthinkable. I did. Seeing flood my timeline the past couple of days over Weinstein & the women hes abused over 3 decades. Sent me reeling with emotion which paralyzed my body w/ anxiety & panic is no joke. My heart breaks for all the women & girls that have endured unspeakable pain. However I also found strength in their stories, strength to share my own. Very few people know my secret, as I was just 7. I have lived with it, tucked away in the cracks of my soul, feeling ashamed for years. The pain & heaviness carrying this load has done me no good. I deserve a better version of myself, free from pain, free to live & love in peace. My family, friends & loved ones deserve the best of me. So, I choose to break my silence for my sanity & healing. I choose to use my voice for you, the little girls & women who have endured the unthinkable. WE are resilient, strong & will be set free from the pain & fear we never asked for. There is pain in healing & healing propels you into a higher version of yourself. This is the closest Ive ever been to healings door. Ive reached to grab the handle & Im walking through the door. To all of you that have fallen victim I urge you to walk through healings door, Ill see you on the other side with the other woman who have gone before. I see you, I feel you & I stand with you hand in hand. You, the man whose name is unknown, the man that robbed me of my innocence & soul. You made me feel incomplete & robbed me of my security. I dont know your name, but I know your face to a T. That day has been imbedded in my mind & will haunt me until the day I die & chase me for eternity. I was just a little girl that wanted to ride her bicycle down the street. I never got that far. In fact, I hardly left my driveway. You stopped me at the sidewalk & knelt down at my side. You placed your hand on my thigh & looked straight into my eyes as your fingers searched my innocence.... (CONTINUED IN COMMENTS)",0,0

"A story of casual everyday sexism, reposted from (PS. Do not hesitate to see this amazing band if you get the chance.) . Back in Jan 2018 when Beaux Gris Gris was booking shows in the UK, we were told by a venue that they do not book female-fronted bands as headliners. (One of the many surprising challenges for female bands.) The story blew up and even invited me to do a guest article. After seeing my post, reached out and said they were shocked that we were being treated that way and committed to book us for 2019. Little did anyone know that in that short year would grow and we would be one of the headliners of that festival. Thank you Jason & Paddy for giving us a chance and for supporting women and men in music. Because you believed in us, now other people do too. Forever grateful.

"I've had my bra straps snapped and swimsuit strings untied in a public pool by guys ""just being guys"" I've taken a lift home with one of my best guy friends, only for him to stop in an empty field and force me to give him a blowie. I didn't want to be raped, so I did it. It was my first time. I didn't tell anyone, because I didn't think anyone would believe me. I've walked home alone, not sure if I'd make it there alive. I've been catcalled (even when with my kids). I've had men whistle at me from cars, only to be sworn at if I didn't respond to their ""compliments"". I have sat in a train car while a man masturbated while looking directly at me. I've been slapped on the ass while waitressing. I've had my drink spiked while out with my girlfriends. I locked myself in the bathroom before everything went black. I've had a famous rugby player who is twice my size pick me up against a wall in a club, and grind against me while trying to take my panties off. 8 years ago, on my birthday, I went out with two girlfriends. I just had my daughter 8 months before, and wanted to feel part of the world again. A man slipped his hand into my dress by the bar and started groping me. I struggled to push him off, everyone could see - no one helped. I slapped him, and he threw me to the ground and swore at me while his friends laughed nervously. I was too afraid to leave the club, I was afraid that he would follow me to my cab. My husband and 8 month old daughter had to come fetch me in town, in the middle of the night. If things took a turn for the worse they would say that it was because I was showing off my cleavage, or because I had no place being in a club as a mother. That I deserved it. I haven't gone out with friends since. Womens month is nothing to celebrate. We should be angry. We also need to be afraid. Fear helps us run. It helps us avoid unsafe situations in the first place. It is a critical survival emotion for human beings to access in healthy, appropriate doses. We need our anger too. Anger protects us, and it restores us. It gives us our dignity. It sets boundaries. It takes action. It insists on change. It makes a scene. It demands attention.",1,1

"Beautiful little boat spotted on the Thames. I was running past it towards Blackfriars and I spotted it. It wasnt a great run. I was catcalled twice by groups of men. Unfortunately not an isolated experience. First time was I wolf whistled at which was unpleasant and made me feel quite self conscious - but I kept on going. Second time it was slow claps and direct eye contact, right in my face as I jogged past (I was jogging slowly because I was stuck behind a group of tourists). That time I felt really threatened. The slow claps felt quite sarcastic. The eye contact felt threatening. It rather took my energy away and I didnt complete the whole distance I wanted to because of it. Easy to say - ignore it. Hard to do and I dont think I should. But hey - I went out for a run anyway and I kept on going. I could probably out run those men thats for sure.

"BITTEN. BRUISED. BULLIED. BULLEIT. - I have been very triggered this week. Especially since finding Diageo's long standing advertisements online of me at World Class. Seeing the album of almost 60 photographs of the place where I was assaulted brought up a lot of visceral memories of being pushed, thrown, restrained, hurt... Moments like these, when we find a treasure trove for our war chest are not bittersweet. They just fucking suck. - I am aware of people making fun of the word ""triggered"". It is a short word to explain what it actually means and compared to what I go through when I am ""triggered."" This past week I have had assault nightmares, anxiety attacks, flashbacks, I could feel myself in the loft that it occurred in, multiple back seizures, my jaw has tightened again. I am hesitant to say these things because I do not want Diageo to think that I can be beaten into submission by their silence and aggressive tactics. But it needs to be said. I am a survivor and I need to honor my experience of this process, if only to prepare others that decide to go down a similar route when going public and asking for help. - On the site there is a quote that ""There is Healing in Action."" I am finding this to be true. I am angry often at Diageos reaction in the past and present. I am sad as a daughter who should have had a family to help her. When my adrenaline starts to rise, I find that telling my truth, creating tools, and writing have been positive outlets to morph victim energy into survivor energy. - We need help getting the word out to people beyond our social sphere and industry that this occurred in.

"Those who have watched know the two boys as Monty (the bully) and Tyler (the bullied). Tyler was one of those people in your class who is bullied by everybody, including the so called good boys like Clay and Zach. While watching the story unfold, I remembered some of the girls from my school days, who had faced bullying. I wasn't really a popular girl in my school till class X, but I was one of the popular group of girls. I always had friends, was one of the toppers and generally had an enjoyable school life. Then I changed my school after class X boards and entered a coeducational school for the first time. First, the attention was exhilarating. I was after all the new girl. I was under spotlight and scrutiny. I was friends with the popular people viz the school band members, athletes and what not. Then it all began. The and got so bad in Class XII that I was practically isolated. Will you believe if I say that at a friend's birthday party, the entire class except I, was invited? In the off periods, I sought solace in the library till I saw my classmates there. Then I began to frequent the 'meditation room'. My school was part of the Aurobindo Institute of Culture, so I immersed myself in the teachings of Sri Aurobindo and Sree Ma. I wouldn't talk to anyone in my class. I hated going to school and did so only for the sake of attendance. My grades were falling to record lows (I got 56 in my preboards Maths). I was suffering from but I didn't know it then.

There were rumors in the office that we had an affair because a men and a women shouldn't get on. So that night I was super drunk und he used that against me. I could barely walk straight. He told me that he was into me for almost a year now and then he kissed and touched me, put my hand into his pants. I didn't want to but I was frozen. Waking up the next morning, I was crying and feeling used and raped but no one would believe me if I told them. So I kept it to myself until now.",0,0

"The first step towards change is awareness followed by acceptance; it makes an incredibly fertile soil to sow the seeds of change and paves the way towards inner peace. Acceptance is about being in the moment rather than agreeing with it and about facing reality rather than trying to control it; it does not mean resignation or running away from the struggle. On the contrary, it means accepting it as it comes, with all the handicaps of heredity, of suffering, of psychological complexes and injustices. Acceptance doesnt mean that life gets better; it just means that one's way of living life on lifes terms improves.The greatest gift that you can give to others is the gift of unconditional love and acceptance; have a big enough heart to love without expectations, and a broad enough mind to embrace the differences that make each of us unique. To be fully seen by somebody, and be loved anyhow; this is a human offering that can border on miraculous. Serenity comes when you trade in expectations for acceptance; it is the calm subservience that things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. Acceptance of what has happened is the first step to overcoming the consequences of any misfortune; learning to accept what is most difficult, can be one of the most rewarding experiences of our lives. There are things that we think we will never be able to get past; these might be traumas that we cannot imagine healing from, or anger we cant imagine letting go of. However, if we learn what it means to be accepting, to let things go and move forward ; we find peace, a huge weight is lifted off of our shoulders, and this indeed is the greatest gift that we can give to ourselves.",0,0

""I was told my clothes were a distraction & was offered a baggy pair of sweatpants to wear as an alternative,"" she told me. ""I chose to refuse the pants & contacted a parent instead because I felt that their big baggy pants would have been way more of a distraction than my original outfit ever was. I believe the school makes us wear their baggy pants as a form of punishment through embarrassment. This made me so angry. I was pulled out of school and sexualized for absolutely no reason."" Yet because Aleigh is the school's majorette in the band, and performed at a half-time show the next night, she had to wear a costume that in fact was more revealing than her leggings were. *** Photos used with permission.

"I don't often talk about my work here, because I like to use this page to agonize and cry over my non-existent academic carrier and feel like my hate-love relation with my current job would be just too much for one instagram feed. But I had a very interesting conversation today, which cannot be really explained out of the context of my daily job. . So I work for a membership organization facilitating a networking platform and creating events for young founders. It's a hip, friendly, informal bunch with successful companies, big visions and huge ambitions. And obviously, it's a boys' club, more specifically a privileged white boys' club. While individually they are pretty cool people, as an organization this is really not the direction I want the group to grow further. So when I started and pointed out that we had less than 15% female members (let's not even talk about ethnic diversity...), they crowned me with the fantastic responsibility of solving this. Yeey, I am a woman, so I definitely can get more women on board! Surprise, surprise, it's not that easy. We are still struggling, but minor achievement alert! we actually acknowledge the issue now openly! There have been (and will be) a lot of ups and downs in this journey, but one of the things which always breaks my wings is the feeling that the management only stands behind me and this project because ""it is the right thing to say"". Because diversity and inclusion is trendy, and they want to jump on the bandwagon. I feel everyday that when they say ""we need more female entrepreneurs"", they don't we need to include successful business women because that's good for us; that brings value, knowledge and different perspectives. They actually we need to do this so we cannot be picked upon. We need this so our pictures on the website look diverse. Look that's a non-white female on our landing page! And it makes me f&%$ing mad. I had a conversation with a consultant lady today and she offered me a completely different approach. She told me ""Ok what if they only let you work on this, because they want to be hip and liked? Nothing. Grab the opportunity and make it happen.""",0,0

"*Trigger warning* I used to start drinking as early as 5 pm and already be drunk by 7ish, this is when I'd try to reach out to people, post statuses like this, even try to hang out with people I didn't know because I was so damn lonely and only felt confident enough to socialize when I was hammered. I haven't really disclosed this on here (or anywhere quite frankly) but here goes, this is also when I'd go on a lot of ""first dates"" with guys I met off the internet. First dates is in quotations because it was more like we'd get drunk (I'd usually get waaay more drunk then they would) and have sex with them, horrified that they didn't want to be my boyfriend the next day, sometimes I'd wake up and they'd already be gone and I'd sob for hours and wonder what I did wrong. I'm so ashamed about the number of men I've had sex with (definitely over 50 which I can hardly believe) when I tell people that number I can see the judgement in their eyes and it still kills me. I remember when I was younger I wanted to save myself for marriage. Sometimes I'd meet men from the internet at their place or have them come directly to my place, I could've been killed, I was raped several times from doing this and I don't actually believe I was ever really sober enough to give consent 99.9% of the time but I don't often think about it and there's a lot of stuff I don't remember due to being in a blackout state. I did a loooot of sexual acts that I wasn't comfortable with and started hating myself more and more. I rarely used condoms with any of these men and that could've resulted in something horrible (luckily it didn't). It was always the same routine, I'd start drinking and when the alcohol wasn't enough to fill my void I'd seek out male attention and company. Even when I was using alcohol to fill my emptiness it wasn't enough. I wasn't planning on going so deep with this post but I guess I really needed to get that out. Sometimes I forget the extent of my horrible drunken states but writing this all out reminds me. So if you've ever drank too much, been slut shamed, hated yourself, hated your body, had men take advantage of you, felt lonely, etc. Please know you're not alone ",0,0

For some survivors telling their story is a radical act of healing if their reality has been denied or they have been conditioned to protect the feelings of another at the expense of there own. Survivors own their stories and with that they have the right to choose to withhold or share them The unfortunate truth is that most people who do come forward are subjected to further feelings of shame by being dismissed, their motives, actions questioned and worried that our untold stories will invite disapproval and victim blaming/shaming.

"Its about bloody time new book is about PERIODS - at last more discussion about womens health! And its thanks to women like Emma, that I recently felt very comfortable to show my 11 year old boy a tampon and a sanitary towel and explained in depth how each is used. He was relaxed and happy to discuss as if it were a normal everyday habit. Which it is, and I hope his future girlfriend/wife will have his full commitment and empathy during their period. I also did this because at his school the boys were not shown the products in real life when they had a discussion about their bodies and sex education. Ive been on a period for 11 weeks since having the mirena coil fitted in June, and Im exhausted!

"Not only is this article suggesting that men should do housework and chores in an attempt to get sex from their partner (choreplay, Daily Mail? Really?) as opposed to doing housework and chores because they want to and because they are in fact adults, this article also places the blame for men not contributing the housework onto women. It paints women as control freaks who are unwilling to let their male partners do housework when the problem is that a lot men have been raised in a society where men are often described as hapless and hopeless and useless - there is a discourse of men being unable to do basic jobs around the house and a if you do the job wrong once, shell never ask you to do it again locker room culture between many men. It is a source of comedy, found often in TV sitcoms - the hapless husband left to look after the house on the rare occasion the wife is busy and the whole house and the children end up a hilarious disaster which the women eventually comes home and fixes. If women are reluctant to relinquish control of housework, it is because of this men are useless trope which is fed to us through advertising, TV and movies. By society doing this, we are enabling men to be hopeless and giving them excuses. This issue of the division of household duties is multi-faceted and seriously complex but the Daily Mail really havent grasped the problem here at all.",1,1

Leaves a suicide note as his wife leaves him & his reputation tarnished. How many will speak up for him now? How many will speak up against the misuse of . Who is responsible? Muhammad Afzal Mehmood, a lecturer of English Literature, was accused of harassment by a student of BS (bachelor of science) Mass Communication; a claim which the late teacher refuted and which turned out to be unfounded by the college harassment committee assigned to probe into the matter. However, college authorities failed to formally clear Afzals name by not issuing him a letter of exoneration. Afzal expressed, I leave this matter in the court of Allah while requesting that the police are requested not to investigate and bother anybody. In the letter, Afzal lamented the unfairness with which he was treated, saying that his reputation had been tainted beyond repair and that his wife had left him as a result. College authorities confirmed that Afzal was asked to appear before the harassment committee when allegations against him first emerged on July 8, 2019. Taking to a private news agency, enquiry officer Dr Aalia Rehman said that the nature of the allegations were flimsy to say the least and did not warrant official proceedings.

"Since we all inhabit the earth, all of us are considered earthlings. There is no sexism, no racism or speciesism in the term earthling. It encompasses each and every one of warm or cold blooded, mammal, vertebrate or invertebrate, bird, reptile, amphibian, fish, and human alike. Humans, therefore, being not the only species on the planet, share this world with millions of other living creatures, as we all evolve here together. However, it is the human earthling who tends to dominate the earth, often times treating other fellow earthlings and living beings as mere objects. This is what is meant by speciesism. By analogy with racism and sexism, the term speciesism is a prejudice or attitude of bias in favor of the interests of members of ones own species and against those of members of other species. If a being suffers there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that ones suffering can be counted equally with the like suffering of any other being. Racists violate the principle of equality by giving greater right to the interests of members of their own race. Sexists violate the principle of equality by favoring the interests of their own sex. Similarly, speciesists allow the interests of their own species to override the greater interests of members of other species. In each case, the pattern is identical. In each and all such cases, humans who have power exploit those who lack it. The desires for food and water, shelter and companionship, freedom of movement and avoidance of pain? These desires are shared by nonhuman animals and human beings. As for like humans, many nonhuman animals understand the world in which they live and move. Otherwise, they could not survive. So beneath the many differences, there is sameness.-earthlings transcript Where is the love, and respect for the animals, that you pay someone to kill for you? EMBRACE VEGANISM Video credit",0,0

"Being a woman in India is still not the easiest task. We need to think before deciding what to wear, do or say. Do we ourselves think from the male perspective? Even when a woman is fully clothed, people, including other women, will find a way to blame and shame her for exposing some part of her body (even if that part is smaller than a toenail). This may sound ridiculous but it is true, especially in countries like India.  Men can roam around the streets bare-bodied wearing nothing but shorts or something even shorter than that and no one gives a f**k. No one will call them a slut nor will anyone hassle them in any way. But a woman would be subjected to some form of harassment regardless of what she wears. And if she makes the brave decision of wearing a garment that exposes even a part of her arms, feet, back, neck or anything else that society feels she should cover, the general public will objectify and slut-shame her, an incisive post by Aditya Pandey.

Those who are feminists are wanting to balance out the imbalance in society, show through all facets of life, personal and professional. It is not a hatred of men. Its showing the reality women have to live with in essentially a mans world. Showing these realities is hard to stomach at first, but once you educate yourself on how to be self aware of your actions and current social norms that promote imbalance. Youll soon find that the way some (unfortunately its more the majority) of people talk, act and behave is a detriment to half the population. There are so many areas to discuss with this topic.

"A slut is someone, usually a woman, whos stepped outside of the very narrow lane that good girls are supposed to stay within. Sluts are loud. Were messy. We dont behave. In fact, the original definition of slut meant untidy woman. But since we live in a world that relies on women to be tidy in all ways, to be quiet and obedient and agreeable and available (but never aggressive), those of us who color outside of the lines get called sluts. And that word is meant to keep us in line.  Jaclyn Friedman . . .",1,1

"NEWS! MEN WHO HATE WOMEN, out May 2020. The past year of my life has been consumed by a project that has felt urgent, terrifying and shocking. It has been really strange to be immersed in a world of violence and hatred that is actively and directly causing mass murders of women, to see boys being deliberately groomed and radicalised and to trace the ideology and messaging I was finding deep online right through our mainstream and media and into our politics and homes, all without much mainstream awareness at all that this is happening. Im both excited and scared about this book coming out and will really appreciate any support as I am already starting to experience what I know will be a massive backlash from the communities this book aims to expose. If you think you might like to read it, pre-orders make a massive difference to authors as they help persuade booksellers to stock the book - link in my bio",1,2

How many people have been slut shamed before they even had any sexual activity ? I know I was. Slut shaming isnt even about sexual history at times.

"All women seeing this will know their clothing is always a subject people (men) feel they have a say in. Nevertheless up until yesterday, there weren't any laws prohibiting any piece of clothing. As of yesterday, though, Women aren't allowed to wear a burka anymore, BY LAW, in the Netherlands. Having the freedom to wear what you want was the last thing I thought would change for the worst in my country. This is a matter for the women who wear burkas and for them only. It is their basic human right to decide for themselves how they want to dress, what their connection to Allah is and how that manifests. NOT something politics should have a say in. They are censored as of yesterday, and this is not acceptable. I also feel it's ironic a lot of the people who are behind this law have the (very wrongfully) prejudiced notion that Muslim women are undoubtedly being repressed by men, when THEY are the ones doing it now.",0,0

How Erika Lust responds to sexual misconduct on her sets.  2. Olympe de G's prior abusive & unethical behaviour, besides myself & my experience. 3. Erika Lust knowingly creating unsafe working environments by sidestepping & hiding prior boundary violations and unethical working practices.

"Dear boys (yes, you are boys, you are so very far from being men), its not just what you did that fucked me off, its who you did it to. I saw you. And you know you did it. Because, as the meme goes, theres nobody who protests harder than a guy accused of something he very definitely did. And when you tried to bully - yes, you definitely did that too - a woman who is older and wiser than you, and you challenged her to seek out a member of authority to back her up, you thought she wouldnt. So yes, I did it. And I felt shit about it, because not only was it unnecessary, but if it had been literally anyone else in the gym (for I was the only woman there at the time) who challenged you, you wouldnt have dared to bite back. Not a chance. So not only did you breach some etiquette, but you were also utterly sexist about it. And this, dear world, is the kind of shameful behaviour that puts people off. This is a barrier to entry for those who are even a little bit scared, never mind the ones who are downright intimidated. I am a woman of extraordinary born and raised in a first world country to a middle class family; Caucasian; well-educated; never unemployed; generally healthy and, when not, able to readily access healthcare which is free at the point of use... and yet theres this fuckery. Something no man will ever, ever understand. Its almost intangible. But this shit goes down almost daily. And, in fact, since Ive got older and fitter, its got worse. The unsolicited passing looks when Im innocently going about my business; the smiles and comments; the fucking behaviour. Its desperately irritating. And Im one of the tough ones, Im the one wholl call it out and let you know that its not ok. This must happen thousands of times per minute, is it any wonder it persists when it goes so unchecked? And this is the face I pull, when I have to confront it yet again. Because Im tired. Sick and tired of you and your attitude, and that you think its ok to make another human being feel uncomfortable. I hope youre proud of yourselves, I hope you sleep well tonight, and I hope that one day, you do better. Goodness knows you cant do a lot worse",1,1

I really wish I had seen this seven years ago when I was in abusing relationship and my ex called me a slut for wearing denim shorts and t shirt to a festival...SMH But I also grew up in a family where a skirt that was above my knees would be considered slutty and I was told I was asking for rape. These are the kinds of things I grew up hearing and it's just not OK. We need to stop blaming women for being raped and create a society where men see rape as totally unacceptable and an inhuman act to do to another. I am glad more awareness is happening and we may live to see a generation where rape becomes this barbaric thing that used to happen. ~Oshun-Lilith,0,0

"The stories about online shaming in this book shock me to the core.  Before entering an flight to Africa a woman makes a (very distasteful) joke about AIDS to her 170 followers. On arrival in Africa she was the most hated person alive; she had journalist waiting for her in the airport to capture her reaction when she turned on her phone and realize the shit storm she has unintentionally had started.  Two friends joke between themselves about big dongles on 10th row of a tech conference. A person in front of them is not as amused by the jokes posts a picture of them online. A few minutes later they are both out of a jobs and just at the starting point of the shit fest to come.  To me the most frightening aspect of online shaming is the speed of which someone can go from living a normal life to being totally annihilated socially, professionally, and privately.  Im going to get you fired! vs. Im going to rape you!. Shaming comments follows cultural & gender norms; Men are expected to be employed and the highest degradation of a women is rape. (A bit uneven maybe? - What the first page (on Google) looks like determines what people think of you. There are now companies that offer reputation clean-ups on the web. Very handy after being shamed! - Your explanation or apology will never get the attention of the original mistake or misjudgment. Forever alone!!  Facebook is where you lie to your friends and Twitter is where you tell the truth to strangers.  Maybe we are creating a more conformist, conservative age where We are defining the boundaries of normality by tearing apart people outside it. I have noticed , since i started this book, that Im being more careful of how I express myself online...and that kinda sucks.   Scary parts aside - its a very funny and seriously entertaining book. It feels really relevant today. You should pick it up!  Whats your thoughts on this subject??  4/5",0,0

Having lived in 2 of the worlds most picturesque cities, I can sympathise with a dislike for tourists. Nobody should be allowed to travel to Venice who cannot pass a history test on her, and no one should be allowed to visit Hoi An who arrives by bus.  There IS a tourism saturation point, beyond which existence as resident AND tourist are depressingly infuriating.  But here?!? Take our goddam money and chillax, Crete!

"I'm having a debate about the word 'slut' and its meaning. This guy believes that sluts don't have standards. I beg to differ. Since when have sluts NOT had standards??? From a slut to a prude, arousing a woman starts long before they get into bed with a man. A slut is just a sexually liberated woman, who sleeps with who she WANTS, when she wants, how quickly she wants, and with how many she wants. But that doesn't necessarily mean she's jumping on the first that walks by. Samantha from Sex and the City was a sexually liberated woman with standards, but what other quick one-word label would you give her aside from slut? Men just THINK sluts don't have standards because she didn't pick them. It's easier to try to dismiss her as something dirty than to admit they are failing or lacking in some way.

"Slut Pouch If anyone saw my stories yesterday I was testing different colours of this block for the knickers.

So much so Ive put it on Etsy. The stitching, zip and lining match the turquoise print and Ive added interfacing to give it a bit more substance and its not too floppy.

"""Do you veil?"" Yes! I started at (my church is not a Mass) two weeks ago. This is the third that I've done it. Nobody has said anything about it or given me a weird look, other than my siblings. I still sit in the front pews, and I still wear it to the front if I'm asked to minister. Tbh I didn't feel very , even though none of the other wear them. It actually feels and safe to me. One of my older sisters told me that veiling is sexist- a symbol of to women. What I find is that people see a huge problem with women in the laity traditionally being expected to veil, but there isn't as much as a peep about the men in the laity traditionally being expected to never cover their heads. I'm saying that I don't see the point of having such one-sided focus. Why should she? Why shouldn't he? What if a man wants to veil? It'd be disrespectful. In the Church, and I'm sure it's not just us, everything is not about doing whatever you want. It's all about and to God, a small-""t"" . It's trying to reject . It's much bigger than we are.

I am scrolling, trying to figure out what gems I wanna drop today and notice that he is with a thin Black woman with very long braids, folding clothes together. They dont speak as they fold. I guess his partner left, because when I look up, he is in front of me. He tells me that he wants to apologize to me. Immediately, I sit straight and become on guard. Automatically, I thought he was video taping me secretly. I ask him whats there to be sorry about and that he was making me nervous. He says, I know this is probably weird, but I just need to Ive been going through a lot, especially with my girl. Im in a committed relationship though. And, I just wanna say you are very beautiful. But, when you walked in, I looked at your body and started having bad thoughts. I know you get this a lot and I just wanted to say that I was sorry for that.

"It's not always easy to convince someone a need exists, if they don't have that need themselves.- Caroline Criado Perez, Invisible Data Bias in a World Designed for Men  Yesterday I listened to a German podcast from a famous newspaper and the episode was about gender-gap in medicine. How most pills and drugs are only tested on young and healthy white males, which in return means they dont really work so well on women. Part of the reason why that is, is that womens cycles are too unpredictable for science, so it screws up their plan and timeline during drug testing. Way to work with nature. Another reason is that women carry babies and during drug testing they could either lose them if theyre already pregnant or become infertile. Good reasons to avoid women in fertile years, but what about women in and after menopause? Also did you know that more women die of heart attacks than men? The reason for it, is that female symptoms are way different then the classical male symptoms of chest pain and a tingling arm. Most women experience unnoticed heart attack symptoms over weeks simply because they cant read the signs. Cars are designed for males. Women are less safe during car accidents because airbags are wrongly placed for them. Women make up more than half of the worlds population and yet we are still invisible for our society and economy.",0,0

Despite being a proud feminist, the shame I feel weakens me. My mind goes to a place I do not like. I start questioning my choice of outfit. I regret wearing what I am. I regret hanging out with so many men. I regret being there. It takes me much longer than I would like to realise that it was neither my outfit nor my behaviours that caused the incident; it was the man, he was the problem, not me. I need to disown the blame for it has no place in my mind or body. Unfortunate as it seems, the horrible incident has given me knowledge and strength should I face harassment again in the future.

"- Meet The Artists - Ariel Baillie Creative Artist I have been drawing since I was able to pick up a crayon. I have always loved arts and crafts and creating anything that came to mind. Growing up as a very nomadic child I was exposed to different parts of the world at a very young age which opened up my mind to a whole new perspective. I didnt start focusing on acrylic paintings until I moved to vancouver in 2018. The response I received from my pieces opened up opportunities I never thought could become a reality. It sparked something within me and I have never looked back. As each piece I created recieved such different interpretations it hit me to want to portray a message that could mean more to someone than just ""I like that"". This is where I met the beautiful mind of Aubree. I had done a couple sketches of females that I posted on an Instagram story and she asked me if she could use them. This being my first time that anyone has asked to collaborate on a piece I was Instantly intrigued. The piece she created blew me out of the water and I never thought I could see my sketches come to life the way she merged them together and put colour into it. I feel like this piece is where it all started for TPIF to come to light. To empower each other to create and be represented in the art world never has meant so much to me then this moment right now. To see creative minds of women come together and make an impact is exactly what we want to do with TPIF. The time is now to go for our dreams and create a reality with our goals. Women dont need to find a voice, they have a voice, and they need to feel empowered to use it, and people need to be encouraged to listen.

"(Ebook) In spite of the and movements, many women are still afraid to say no to unwanted sexual advances and reluctant to report sexual violations. Far too many college students are being raped and are afraid to report it. Women are subjected to sexual harassment, sexual bullying, and sexual pressure every day on the street, at work, and at home but are unable to speak truth to power or to report these sexual offenses. Im Saying No! is written specifically for these womenwomen who are still afraid to speak up for themselves, women who need to learn how to do so, and women whose personal history of child sexual abuse or sexual assault as an adult has wounded them so much that they have lost their voice. Here, Beverly Engelan internationally recognized psychotherapist and acclaimed advocate for victims of sexual, physical, and emotional abuseoffers a ground-breaking program to help all the women who have been silenced by past trauma, women who were raised to believe they didnt have a right to say no, and women who have spoken out in the past only to go unheard. Bold and timely, Im Saying No! offers women the encouragement, support, and guidelines they need in order to become the powerful women they arewomen who believe in themselves and stand up for themselves.

One of the volunteers says to watch out scooping too much sand up from around the hill as the flood is coming m. He carries on scooping and chucking more sand up there energetically. His mum says as she watches well, Im raising a boy! Ha! It struck me that such an innocent comment was heard by about 5 other children of both genders. Whats the message? Boys dont follow rules? Boys are unstoppable? Boys build big? The inference being that girls dont do those things? Whatever it was it just made me think, why did she feel compelled to mention gender.

They claim that the often submissive and flirty responses offered by the systems to many queries  including outright abusive ones  reinforce ideas of women as subservient.

"As we gear up to launch something new and (hopefully) exciting, it's probably time for a little intro. Here's a bit about me, and I'd love to hear about you - please comment below! So, yes, hello! I'm a 30-something mother of one, currently on maternity leave from a career in advertising. I love writing, baking and hiking; I've got the biggest sweet tooth, and also a serious case of wanderlust (40 odd countries and counting). I live in London with my husband, our daughter and our very friendly (but very stupid) cat. And I've been passionate about gender equality for, well, pretty much as long as I can remember. Ive always had the urge to do something more  a feeling that I too have a bigger role to play in the pursuit of equality. Ive explored a lot of different ways from Womens Marches to Lean In groups, from running workshops in schools to podcasts on womens leadership, and from Parliament events to Women of the World conference workshops. Oh, and of course a steady stream of heartfelt and passionate chats with friends, co-workers and family over tea (and usually Pret gingerbread men, my weakness in life). These have all been brilliant (especially the gingerbread men), and Ive met some amazing people along the way who are doing truly incredible things. Ive been inspired, and awed, and frustrated, and excited. But, for all of this, I still cant help feeling that I havent quite found *it*. When I became pregnant for the first time, I had a bit of a revelation. Many years ago, in an excited conversation with a friend and after perhaps slightly too much wine, we ambitiously debated what we thought the answer was to gender inequality. Naive grand visionary as I was back then, the broad answer I landed on I believe still that if we really want to affect change, we have to start at birth, before gender preconceptions are set. If we want our children to succeed in a variety of careers, we have to enable them from a very early age to believe that they can be anything, igniting their ambition and redefining what careers are open to them and what leadership means. Im on a mission to do that!",0,0

"I remember very clearly being five or six and and my introduction to sex went something like this ; The Bible tells us - you have to save yourself for marriage and save yourself for your husband . I understood it as something that happened to me , pleasure was not part of the conversation nor sensuality and or sexiness . When I got abit older , I saw how women that were sexy were treated and called ; I was both intrigued and confused . When my body started coming in and I became aware of what the swing of my hips our the sight of my breath could do , I was even more intrigued. When I started having sex with someone I thought I loved ( lets having a pause for laughter ) and I was shamed for doing things that I thought people in love were supposed to do , I was confused . When I was called names by both older women and my own peers because unknowingly I oozed confidence and sexiness from my speech to my mannerisms - I was confused When the pastors speech remained that the reasoning behind my sensuality was because I was a MAMIWATA- I was confused as hell . It is only when I sat down with myself and decided to explore all sides of me that I have been able to accept that yes I am a multi faced woman that enjoys good conversation about almost anything and I have a certain je-ne-sais-quoi that leaves you wondering . My physical appeal doesnt define my whole being but it is part of it so I take pride in it . I am confortable in my skin and I refuse to let someones internalized issues become my internal dialogue and definitely will not let that shit have an impact of how I carry myself externally. I know this is a long shot but I wish every women will experience freedom when it comes to their sexuality especially woc specifically black women , precisely African women . Being sexy has a different meaning for everyone ; take the time to get to know you so you can give it a definition that belongs and sits well with you .  when you feeel good , you looook good , you will attract GOODNESS.",0,0

"Nudity. Probably my most controversial post as I judge an girl. I wrote this post quickly and in the moment of being disappointed that everything I ever believed about nudity, such as it shouldnt be sexualised and instead respected as an art, was thrown out the window with young girls willingly sexualising themselves for cash. Only fans goes against every value I believe in when it comes to nudity and made me feel slutty sharing pictures in lingerie even though I only do this cause I genuinely love myself, look good and dont see myself any different in lingerie or clothes. I needed to write this to remind myself that there are many women like me who will advocate for slut shaming, feminism and just treating the female body as a body not a piece of meat. Im not a slut if I post nude picture. The body is more than sex. And the whole bullshit of playing into mens desires is bullshit, men will sexualise you no matter what clothes or no clothes so they may aswell get to see the ass they can never have. If I ever wanted a mans attention Id send him a far worse picture than what I would share in a private snap. Reading this back I think I was harsh in my judgement but I was honest and dont take anything back. I will say though people can do whatever they want and if this is the way they want to earn their money thats their business, the world needs porn stars and only fan girls and all these things too how, its a fantasy world we need to escape to. . . . .",1,2

"A unique piece, like a gentle ring with a sharp edge. It was very, very sad to hear that Sara Danius passed away last weekend. She was member of the Swedish Academy (est 1786) and the first woman ever to hold the position as its Permanent Secretary. In 2017, opened up many windows to shed light on the 'culture' within the Swedish cultural establishment. Oooh, painful! Who knew there could be such dark corners? It fell on Sara Danius to deal with a serious of scandals involving the Academy. In the turbulence, she was eventually asked to leave her position (and a number of the members stepped down too). It is rare to see someone ride through a public storm like that with such a strength, clarity, integrity and sense of fairness.

"Those sunglasses! And a mesh-leopard-print swimsuit! Last night I thought I'd reset my mood (all work and no play makes Chhavi a grumpy girl) so I chose to watch ""Bombay to Goa"". I think I watched all of 10 Amitabh movies growing up and I'm trying to remedy that. But, it's tough because the movies are so dated, misogynist, and silly, which makes them hard to watch. The comedy is awful, the stalking is out of control (with heroes like these, who needs villains?), the fight sequences were bearable only in 4x speed, the only thing working is that the drama becomes unintentionally hilarious. What even was the plot of this movie? Amitabh shows up one hour into the film! 2 stars out of 10 instead of 1 for the only delightful a singing cameo by Miss Usha Iyer, whom we all know as Usha Uthup now. In a white and gold saree, big red bindi in place she did a medley mashup with presence, humour, and that voice! I mean, she throws ""I married a female wrestler"" and ""Be bop a Lula"" in the mix! Now THAT was worth the price of admission. . . .",0,0

"This is Little A on his way home from his fifth camp of the year. He has eight weeks summer holidays but I dont have eight weeks leave.  In a few weeks, hell go back to school, which starts every morning at 9am but I leave for work before 7am. His classes will finish at but his little brothers classes finish at (yes thats two separate pick up times) the school has no after-school or before-school childcare available and I dont get home from work until   So we implement a chaotic and costly system of unpaid leave, finely tuned schedules, private childcare and relying on the kindness of family. And in this situation I am really totally - we can afford to pay childcare to allow me to work, we have enormous family support, we can take unpaid leave, we are a two parent family, the boys are in a lovely crche. All the stars have aligned in that respect.  But despite my very fortunate circumstances and amazing amount of I am constantly exhausted and consumed by guilt because this situation makes me a substandard parent and a substandard employee.   It has occurred to me that our entire society - from working norms to school timetables - is entirely set up to accommodate two-parent families where one parent (guess who that tends to be?) stays at to cook and clean and shop and iron and do homework and raise children...thats a full time job right there.   For many families, it is more financially viable, more logistically feasible, better even - if a mother (because its usually a mother) stays at home, often giving up her career entirely. All the forces of society work constantly against the model of a two-income family.  Its almost as if they dont really want us to go back to work.   In modern Ireland, a mother being able to work is a luxury. How fucked up is that?   ",0,0

"This week I reported a delivery man whod been making me feel uncomfortable for a few weeks. It wasnt overt, just casual sexism and disrespect. . After I did it, I questioned if I was wrong to do so. Should I be trying to deal with it myself? Did I deserve to have felt the way I did? But then I thought of the rest of my team, mostly teenage girls, dont I also have a duty of care to protect them from such behaviour? . The tipping point was a professional failing of his, which was obvious to others, but would I have done anything if the problem had of just carried on being manageable? . The answer is, Im not sure. But my mind wandered back to what Id read in Everyday Sexism, the stats on reporting sexual harassment, and the change that is brought on when we stand for said change. It makes me feel more comfortable. . But I also worry - at the back of my mind are the justifications of the mans behaviour a man of his time and the impact it could have on future interactions. . Are the worries of repercussions your biggest fear of reporting inappropriate behaviour (aside from personal safety)? Or internal justifications? . Im interested, as I look back on so many interactions Ive had in the past that I brushed off - but dissecting them, would I have reported them if the norm was speaking up? . . .",0,0

And no, doctors are NOT the final authority to determine if a pregnancy is 'safe' or not. Because ALL pregnancies are a huge risk.

But I feel like changing the ways in which society views womens body would be a better solution to this. The way I dress doesnt define who I am, especially if its what other people are labeling me as based solely on my outfits. Im not a slut, and even if I was that wouldnt be an insult. Im not cheap. Im not disrespectful of myself, Im not easy and Im certainly not cattle. Believe it or not Ive been compared to cattle when I was younger for wearing a short skirt. This has to stop.

"Soulful Sunday.... As a young Christian many years ago, I was taught that I had no right to be angry with God. I wasnt supposed to question God.

The child whom we had taken to church from the time she was six weeks old and entrusted her into Gods care. How could God let this happen to her? I was devastated...and that devastation quickly turned to anger. But, who do you tell when youre mad at God and EVERYBODY you know is a believer and you dont think they can handle your truth? You tell God! I was going to church every week and I felt nothing. I could look churchy, say all the right things, and bow my head in prayer, but inside all I felt was anger, confusion, and emptiness....like really empty. This went on for a few years until one day, I couldnt fake it any longer and the Lord said, So are you going to tell me how you really feel? Thats when things got real and I found myself having a real come to Jesus moment with HIM.......thats also when the spiritual healing began to take place.

"Let's slut shaming. Slut Skank Whore Dirtbag Slag Hoe Sket Slosh Brass Well, if I had a penny for every time I've ever been called one of those, I'd be a rich fucking shhlaaaagggg lol! The first time I was ever called one of those words was in Secondary School. I'd been seeing a boy in the year above me, who many years later went on to become the father of my child (oh the fucking irony). The rumours started fairly quickly, you know the ones I mean. The 'she's nasty she did this with him', 'she's such a sket, she did that with him' kind of rumours. I ignored it at first and just laughed it off, refusing to confirm or deny anything. Then things started taking a very bizarre turn very, very quickly. I started to get called names, to my face. People would cough and shout 'sket' as I walked past or mumble 'hoe' under their breath as they walked past me. How fucking rude! I was quite timid at school and would never dare to answer anyone back or stick up for myself, so I went home and cried to my Mum. A LOT! Boys groped me as we passed eachother in the hallways and whenever I tried to push them away I was met with ""you're a fucking slag you love it."" Once I pushed a particular boy away after he put his arm around me and grabbed my boob and he slapped my face so hard, I ended up with a black eye. Girls laughed and bitched about me in quiet corners of the playground. The brazen ones confronted me with accusations. Teachers never intervened and if I ever did complain, all I got was ""boys will be boys, stop telling tales."" A group of people from my year even turned up on my doorstep once to question me about my supposed sexual encounters (middle fingers to you if you were there). Pathetic! But somehow I stuck it out, finished school and passed my exams. Since then, these labels seem to have followed me into my adult life. If I've rejected a man and refused to give him my number. If I've ended a relationship. If I've argued with someone. If it's been 'a joke' or serious. If I've refused to be groped by strangers on a night out. TBC...",0,0

Only fans goes against every value I believe in when it comes to nudity and made me feel slutty sharing pictures in lingerie even though I only do this cause I genuinely love myself, look good and dont see myself any different in lingerie or clothes. I needed to write this to remind myself that there are many women like me who will advocate for slut shaming, feminism and just treating the female body as a body not a piece of meat. Im not a slut if I post nude picture. The body is more than sex. And the whole bullshit of playing into mens desires is bullshit, men will sexualise you no matter what clothes or no clothes so they may aswell get to see the ass they can never have. If I ever wanted a mans attention Id send him a far worse picture than what I would share in a private snap. Reading this back I think I was harsh in my judgement but I was honest and dont take anything back. I will say though people can do whatever they want and if this is the way they want to earn their money thats their business, the world needs porn stars and only fan girls and all these things too how, its a fantasy world we need to escape to. . . .",0,0

Nobody seems to think about the social conditioning that happens Every Time they tell kids these things, or that if you tell someone repeatedly they can't do something, the doubt you've instilled in them will actually hold them back.

"""I was discussing feminism once with a guy I was seeing at the time, and he told me that Western feminism doesn't exist, and that we don't need feminism here in North America, that the women on the picket line fighting to close the wage gaps are just complaining about nothing, and that there's nothing in North America that a man can do that a woman can't. I was so enraged I couldn't even tell him how wrong he was. Do men regularly feel unsafe walking alone at night? Do men lack full bodily autonomy and control over their reproductive rights? Do men have to work twice as hard to prove themselves? Do men risk being regularly objectified and sexualized no matter what they're wearing? Do men make less money than women in the same position as them? Do men contend with gender roles that put them in an oppressive or powerless position? Is men's sexual wellbeing grossly misunderstood and considered secondary to women's? The list goes on and on and on....People who are privileged by the very system that serves them are usually blind to itbecause that's privilege! They don't have to think about it. And I'm not saying we haven't made progress, and I'm not saying I as a white woman don't have ANY privilege because I know on certain levels I do, but we cannot fix the problem of privilege, sexism, racism, transphobia, or homophobia if the people involved in those systems of oppression don't realize or won't recognize that they are in it.

"Hey there everyone please help me speak out for equality and call on everyday sexism in the workplace. Im responding to a recent interview with a highly successful and well known Chef. I am paraphrasing here, but Marco says Male Chefs are faster, stronger,and better under pressure then their female counterparts ( He does throw in a few patronising compliments to women many of which describe how obedient and con-formative they are, turning up wearing the right uniform etc. Basically giving a patronising pat on the head. Here are some quotes from the article so you can see for yourself. Marco Pierre White on Women in the kitchen They are more consistent than men, when it comes to cooking, because they respect the house more, they do their job. They may not be as fast, they may not be as physically strong,"" Marco Pierre White ""The real positive with men is that men can absorb pressure better, that's the main difference, because they are not as emotional and they don't take things personally."" What tends to happen with females in the kitchen is that they tend to go to larder or they tend to go to pastry, they are not in the main kitchen, and so that's why you see a lot of female pastry chefs... they haven't got the pressure."" So faster, better under pressure and stronger! All good grounds to pay higher salaries and promote men faster!? Sounds like rhetoric for discrimination to me. This is so wrong. Female chefs are a minority in the catering industry and here we have someone in a position of power and influence sending out this message how are things ever going to change? Why make the comparison in the first place? Is it; to put women off? To pay them less? Or to put them in their place! Or a combination of all the above? I also love the bit where he says woman respect the home its not the1950s Marco! Heres the article",0,0

But I just know what it's like to be a woman this day and age. How easy it is to succumb to peer pressure. How scary it is just how many women are sexually assaulted and harassed, as shown by the movement, myself included (unfortunately, on several occasions). How hard it is for women to move up the corporate ladder as compared to a man of her same caliber (I too have experienced this first-hand). How women, in many religions, aren't allowed to hold positions of power. How unrealistic standards of beauty are placed on and almost expected of women. And what does this all teach her? That she is not equal? Of lesser intelligence? Not beautiful without makeup? That is just straight up nonsense. I want my daughter to have boundless opportunities - but more than that, I want her to be happy. To ensure that she is ready for whatever challenges she may face, it is my goal to teach my daughter to be brave, to stand up for herself, to be confident - in herself and in her decisions, to know that she can achieve anything she puts her mind to and works hard at.

"SEXUAL ASSAULT/HARASSMENT/RAPE I've been sexually assaulted or harassed (I don't know what term to call it) numerous times since I was a kid. When I was 7 (grade 2) a boy in my class came up to me and started dry humping me. I pushed him away and at the time I didn't understand what had happened. When I was 9 my brother did the same thing to me inside a pool in front of a group of people. I remember not being able to fight him off because I was trying to stay afloat while the weight of him pulled my head underwater. I remember barely being able to breathe. When I was 12 and walking down a crowded street, a strange boy groped me as he walked past. I was with my family but no one saw. At 15 I went to the cinema with a bunch of friends and sat next to a male friend, Josh. He groped my chest and vagina for 2 hours and forced my face into his lap and groin and held my head down there. It was dark and nobody saw, but I remember feeling helpless and weak since I wasn't strong enough to push him away. He was sitting between me and my friends and I was blocked by a wall on one side so I couldn't get out. From when I was 14-18 years old, I had a job, and my manager who was 45+ years old kept telling other coworkers how much he wanted to f*** me and the other female employees and the graphic stuff he wanted to do to us. I never knew about this until my best friend also started working there and told me about it. He also told me how the other night shift workers would talk about wanting to have sex with me and encouraged my best friend to try and f*** me too since we were so close. I quit, and my best friend never tried anything sexual thankfully. I'm 19 now and I do not trust people. I have huge personal space issues and I hate when people even sit to close to me. Something as small as hugs terrify me. Physical contact gives me panic attacks and I hate it. After all these years, I've told no one about it all. I told a few friends about the time at the cinemas (cont. in comments)",0,0

He picked up Everyday sexism but put it down again after a few moments. I told him that it was a good read,uncomfortable, but a good read nevertheless. He asked me if it was uncomfortable as a woman. 'Well, that's the only point of view I can give you,really.' Then he said he was afraid of seeing himself in the book, afraid of reading something and realise that he does or has done that in the past. To this I said that I actually saw myself reflected on some of the stories and on some of the behaviours too. And this is exactly what we need in order to change!

Last month I was on call. I called an on call colleague of a different specialty for an urgent patient consult. Before I was able to say anything, he refused, saying he is busy, and hang up. I called him back and explained my patients case. He asked me to save my breath, hand him someone else because he cannot take a womans talk ... I did not. He came to see the patient briefly after our conversation. What matters is not how I handled it. To me, what matters is to share a lesson learned. Maybe be a reminder to someone.

"When people tell me feminism isn't relevant any more I have to take a long sharp breath. I could write a list as tall as I am with reasons why it's still 150% necessary. Working in pregnancy and birth, this terrain is where I see in minute detail the ways that unequal power-structures constructed around sex and gender are affecting every single woman and birthing person that engages in maternity services . One reason some clients have worked with me is because they're feeling powerless and stuck in their pregnancies. Maternity appointments leave them feeling lost and overwhelmed - a hot, sweaty mess. In the rest of their lives they're totally bossing it. They speak up in what they're passionate about, make important and difficult decisions, call things out, direct the way things run  in their personal lives and in their work . . But there's something about pregnancy that leaves women feeling condemned to having no voice and no control. That's because maternity services and the birth-room is the place where rampant sexism, lack of consent, control over women's bodies and attempts to keep women in line all collide into one big microcosmic clusterfuck of the world around us. It's where the patriarchy rules. Every constructed belief and barrier that's been used to keep women in their place rears it's big ugly head here . . So it's no wonder this is how pregnant women are feeling when they're treated like inept little girls who couldn't possibly know what's good for them and their babies. Who need to be told what to do and put back into their place if they dare step out of line . . I'm not saying midwives or doctors are unethical people who consciously repress women. I'm talking about a birth-culture and system underpinned by patriarchal values, that doesn't trust women and their bodies. The midwives and doctors we interface with are a product of this culture and the 'rules' of the system force them to comply with it in order to keep their jobs . . I also know it's possible to traverse through this system and shape your care around your pregnancy, your individual wants and needs. This is what I'm passionate about helping women to do.

To me, the phrase is literally referring to raping a woman, but according to , the verb means to f*** the pussy and is commonly used in street talk and hip-hop culture. This language perpetuates the idea that women are sex objects for men to conquest. The reproductive organs also loosely resemble a bull skull as a symbol of womens strength and resilience.

"A very old love. Repost with  Noor Inayat Khan - Indian Princess & British Spy Khan was a direct descendant of Tipu Sultan, the 18th century Muslim ruler of Mysore. Khan's father was a musician and Sufi teacher. He moved his family first to London and then to Paris, where Khan was educated and later worked writing childrens' stories. Khan, whose name was in the news in Britain recently as a proposed new face of the 50 note, was 25 when war was declared in 1939. She and her family went to England to volunteer for the war effort, and in 1940 she joined the Womens Auxiliary Air Force and trained to become a radio operator. Able to speak French, she was quickly chosen to go to Paris to join the Special Operations Executive, a secret British organization set up to support resistance to the Germans from behind enemy lines through espionage and sabotage. Many members of the network were arrested shortly afterwards but she chose to remain in France, trying to send messages back to London while avoiding capture. Her transmissions became the only link between the agents around the Paris area and London, Ms. Basu wrote in her biography Spy The Life of Noor Inayat Khan. Khan never made it home from the war. Just as she was about to leave for England in October 1943, she was captured by the Gestapo. Despite repeated torture, she refused to reveal any information and was finally shot and executed in the Dachau concentration camp.

"Slut-shaming is the practice of criticizing people, especially women and girls, who are perceived to violate expectations of behavior and appearance regarding issues related to sexuality (definition from Wikipedia). An shaming a girl for having several bedpartners or wearing short clothes. I'm sure several of you are familiar with the term, and unfortunately with the practice as well. Slut-shaming is tied to sexual double standards, e.g. womxn can't sleep with too many people, while men can sleep with as much people they want. Society shames virgins as well (in my opinion viriginity is a social construct but that's a discussion for another time, to keep it simple virgin = someone who has not participated in any (consensual) sexual activity), for womxn it's a great thing to be, at least up until a certain age (let's say mid-twenties but I feel like that's a stretch already). For men it's absolutely not done to still be a virgin past a certain age. Wikipedia's definition of slut-shaming can encompass this shaming of virginity (past a certain age) but to me the word slut-shaming is more about shaming womxn for being 'overly' sexual than the opposite. I wouldn't really call it slut-shaming when people are shamed or criticized for not having sex or for dressing modestly, I'm not sure what to call it (virgin-shaming?) but I feel like these issues are ignored by not naming it (or grouping it with slut-shaming) . What are your thoughts on this, does a broad definition of slut-shaming suffice or should there be a distinction? What are you're experiences with slut- and 'virgin'-shaming? . . .",0,0

It didnt feel authentic, or real, but I wasnt getting the support I desperately wanted and needed at home. At 18, it happened again, this time a stranger in my apartment, a friend of my roommates. They saw and didnt stop it, despite my pleas. Then they kicked me out and said Id eaten all their groceries...I was hiding alone in my room for nearly a week, not eating and only showering in an attempt to feel clean. My weight fluctuated by emotional eating, often non-eating. I started to heal, and got into a relationship with a guy who fat-shamed me because his cystic fibrosis didnt allow him to gain weight and that made him bitter, and abusive. I dropped that relationship, and soon found myself living alone, able to exercise with love. Im married to the man I met at 20, but when I was 24 we moved to LA to follow our dreams. I was the epitome of , landed my dream job but soon after was raped again by my employer, after he took me to a work party and drugged my champagne. 2 months later I was pregnant not his I craved everything healthy and good for my body! I did ate ALL the fruits and veggies I could get, walked to and from school, and LOVED being pregnant. I didnt yet have the flashbacks of the night with my boss. I kept telling myself it wasnt true. 2 years later I couldnt stop the and told my husband. My health and weight has yo-yod ever since. I didnt make time to and my brain has been tricked into equating health=rape Here I am today, 2 beautiful children, an incredible husband, Im choosing to go with what scares me health w/o fear or repercussions.

"We are two young women from Vienna who, for several years, have been thinking about how to share our personal encounters with sexism. Whilst on a walk with our dogs, we once again told each other about our latest unpleasant experiences. But this time, our frustration became unbearable - it had been one sexist remark too much. After thorough consideration and intense planning we decided to start a project with which we want to raise awareness for sexism in everyday life. Here we would like to share our stories with you and invite you to do the same. We are thrilled to now share our first post with you and hope to create a platform on which we can support and encourage each other, but also show other people what kinds of situations we are being confronted with. ----------------------------------",0,0
"      For most of us, it is hard to fathom why women wouldn't be supportive. Men can make the workplace miserable for women, as countless stories attest. Then, there are other women. Along with where women report more rudeness from their female co-workers than male colleagues, show mothers, aunts, girlfriends and the like to tear each other down. Why do women do this to each other? - One part of it is that women often view other women as their competition. - Its also possible that breaking those stereotypical gender norms provokes incivility from other women. Women are supposed to be nurturing, kind, sweet, so when theyre more assertive, other women have a hard time accepting that, said Erika Holiday, a licensed clinical psychologist in Studio City, California, and co-author of Mean Girls, Meaner Understanding Why Women Backstab, Betray and Trash Talk Each Other and How to Heal. - Another explanation is that women often feel its safer to take out their aggression on other women than on men, Holiday added. Most women will tell you that they have survived at least one mean girl in their a girl who dismissed, put down, or even socially tormented them. Have you too survived this?

"for Delivering a presentation in a professional setting can be a daunting task for anyone, but especially so if youre an ambitious struggling to ascend the corporate ladder in the face of unconscious gender bias! That being said, key to executing a presentation in a way that most effectively communicates your point is to know your audience, which if youre an American career woman, is more than likely to largely be made up of men who avoid the phrase unconscious gender bias like the plague. If this situation sounds familiar, (worry not!) I encourage you to just relax and continue being yourself but learn to speak in an artificially low voice and to change your name to Jeff. This strategy is effective because it unconsciously creates a more trusting response from this particular audience as it will be more natural for them to trust a deeper voice from a person named Jeff to actually know what theyre talking about than a woman acting normal  even if Jeff has breasts and delivers the presentation in a noticeably unnatural tone of voice. . . . . .",0,0

Sometimes we just enjoy wearing these clothes, and we dont think we should be harassed by you for doing so!). We hate being paid less than men. We hate being disbelieved or mocked if we are raped or sexually assaulted. We hate being told it has something to do with our clothes, or our attitudes, or our status as women. We hate being frightened to report. We DONT hate men, think that we are better than everyone else, think that we should all ditch bras or stop shaving (unless we want to!), think that women should all become boss ladies (unless we want to!), or think that all men are fuckboys. We want equal rights for all; no matter our race, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, class status, pay grade, weight, or fashion style. Sometimes we scream too loud because we are frustrated. Because we feel oppressed and alienated. Because we have lived under the rule of a patriarchal society for centuries. Because, in a world of opposition, we want a voice, too. Overall, though, we just want equality. We want to be free and understood. We want to be recognized.",0,0

"TL;DR I enjoyed this book. Ive just finished reading by Laura Bates. It was a real eye-opener! I found the chapter on women in politics particularly Around the world, women are enormously underrepresented in politics... in February 2013, just 20% of parliamentary seats in the world were held by women. With women being largely outnumbered while ideas are being discussed, it comes with the consequence that policy decisions often disproportionately disadvantage women. For example, women make up two thirds of public-sector workers so budget cuts in this area result in an larger increase in unemployment for women than for men. And, since the majority of primary careers of children, the disabled and the elderly are women, around three quarters of all cuts to benefits come out of womens pockets. Previously I didnt pay much attention to politics. But I am now pledging to pay attention and to support the women in government who are fighting to ensure that the impacts on women are taken into consideration! Hopefully one day we will have a government with a which is representative of our population as a whole and people of colour, LGBTQ people and disabled people are also represented!

"Let's talk about sex. We all need it to be healthy, and yet our society has taught us to be ashamed of our desire for it. It is time to change this, and start talking about the elephant in the room. I've noticed men being ashamed of their sexuality, and physically pressuring women rather than verbalizing their desires first. I recognize the feminine has a deep wound around feeling pressured. I've noticed women being ashamed of their sexuality and not acting on desires out of fear of being 'slut shamed'. I recognize that the masculine has a deep wound around not being recieved. If we start talking more about sex, maybe we can start to talk about how to heal these wounds. Men, I encourage you to face your fear of rejection and verbalize your intent to potential partners. And do it without the physical pressure first (asking for consent when you are already making contact is pressure). The most respected I have ever felt was when a potential partner of mine was sitting across a table from me, hadn't made any physical contact all night, and told me that he wanted to have sex/asked me if the feeling was mutual. Be blunt with it, it is actually more respectful. Women, I encourage you to act on whatever feels good to your body and soul (and remember the power of your 'no' when it feels bad). Lets work to overcome our fears of being shamed by our freinds, family, or spiritual community. In ancient China the taoists would routinely have 'lunch parties' that modern society would now call 'orgies'. Sex was seen as a way to balance out the energies in each partner, and was encouraged in the tradition. How have we gotten where we are now?",0,0

A week ago, in the courthouse, Khodyari overheard that she could face up to two years imprisonment for being seen in public without a hijab, and, as a result, she poured gasoline on herself, and set it alight. The Blue Girl later died in hospital, after 90% of her body was left with third degree burns, and she suffered serious lung damage. The activists death has led to outcry and grief; her favourite club (Esteghlal) published a statement mourning her death, and held a one minutes silence, while Philip Luther from Amnesty International declared the incident heartbreaking, explaining that the death highlighted the effect of Irans ""appalling contempt for women's rights"". - Liz . . . .",0,0

I was friend requested on FB by some dude who had several mutual friends and I usually delete those requests, but I didnt this time because he worked in a similar field as me and I like to network with those people.

I and another woman presented an articulate defense in a strong, but not hateful way. Thats when the misogynists started creeping on our profiles and calling us all sorts of horrible names, attacking our character, even attacking our children.

All it did was expose himself to look like a fucking dumbass. I am a rape and assault survivor. My first assault- I was 16-17 years old. I was not wearing provocative clothing, I was not drinking or asking for it. I was at a friends house in high school and he and his friend drugged me- I was literally drinking Sprite and eating Cheetos . I was in and out of consciousness as they moved a coffee table and pulled my 410 body like a ragdoll on the floor, both of them assaulting me fully while I couldnt move, I couldnt scream, and was blacking out during the attack. I share this because no one is going to tell me I have saggy boobs and no one is going to tell a woman that she was asking to be raped. You try and stick your finger in a mans ass during sex and they clearly know when consent stops. Ill dress how I want, thats not an invitation. . . .",0,0

"A real accomplishment in YA fiction, by certainly gets my nomination for the Carnegie Award 2020 as Welsh Youth Libraries Group Chair. Every teenage girl and boy should read this. Misogynistic attitudes are insidious, infectious and can develop from a young age. It's time to stop 'slut shaming', victim blaming, witch hunts, normalised rape culture, and harassment. Let's start to see it for what it really is; a failing on the part of the harasser, not the harassed. The thought-provoking, relevant and helpful content (including a great example of signposting - pages of information on relevant support organisations and charities) will hopefully guide many a young man and woman to take ownership of their own actions, make informed choices, and challenge ingrained perceptions by calling out when they witness it.

"So I found this picture on and I m thankful. See the light heart imprint in the background? And a naked body. And boldly written. ""I REFUSE TO BECOME WHAT YOU CALL NORMAL"" ""BROKEN ISN'T BAD"" ""HUMAN"" All In all this picture is whole. Every text in this is complete. Every small phrase. Why is a naked girl body showcased here by a line art? And text on her arms and thighs that she is unique. And she is proud of herself. Why are we normalising perfect bodies? Why are we normalising thin Disney like waists, over fair skin and big eyes, slender neck and a sleek nose? Why do we judge people, here, girls, who are ""fat"" (finger quotes), who have a waist size over 40,who are ""dark"", have a big round nose and who wear clothes that she likes, and not the ""society"". And that is, a trend, a big BIG trend, for over so many years now. WHY ARE WE NORMALISING BODY SHAMING. WHY ARE WE NORMALISING SLUT SHAMING. WHY ARE WE NORMALISING IGNORANCE FOR GIRLS WHO STAND AGAINST THESE SHITS. I don't know rest, but every second NORMAL girl goes through this. Body shaming. Slut shaming. In school. I was. Many I know were. And we didn't say anything. I was dumb who stayed quiet all this time. I was dumb who thought it was good to ignore such ill minded people. Let them laugh over the size of my body, let them make fun of how I look. Let them speak shit about me every fucking time. I never said anything. I was dumb. I should have said that. But I didn't and I regret that. Just because I didn't say anything to those sexually shaming bullies then, that might ve made them say same or even worse about / to other girls I may or may not know. This...is something very near to a breakdown. This is something like...""God,why?"" I heard them daily. Passing such cheap comments and I was always quiet about it. I hate myself for that. But now I am not. I am saying this on my public account. Yes, those animals can see it too, and can laugh it off by again calling me slut and what not.

"I was in kindergarten (5-6 years old), and he was in his late teens/early 20s. Have you finished eating lunch? he asked. Yes anne (brother) I replied my cousin brother. Next is nap time. Come on, go to the room and set yourself to sleep. I will check on you, if you didnt, I will tell that you were naughty he said. He comes in the room after some time. He pulled his pants down and pushed my clothes up. He started kissing my body and finally, he rubbed his thing around my lips before putting it into my mouth. After a while, I felt something slimy down my throat and then around my mouth, sometimes if I were lucky, it would be all over my chest instead of in my mouth. I remember it being white and sticky, but I never knew what it was. He would wipe it off me, and he would never fail to whisper this, You are a good girl, this is our little secret, and if you tell anyone, you will be a bad girl and no one will want you. I never told anyone. It was a secret after all, wasnt it? This went on for 2 years of my kindergarten. I wasn't frightened, I was confused but I didn't retaliate because after all, it's our little secret as he put it. I didn't know whether it was good or bad so I never complained about it. I thought this was a form of love too because he never failed to say ""You are my favourite one so I only have this secret with you"". A couple of years later, my cousin brother whos a year older to me started molesting me. Wanna play a game, but you cant tell anyone, they wont understand. I will teach you he would say. He would touch and rub all over me, and have me to do the same for him. This happened over a year and became another secret I held on to. READ MORE IN THE LINK ON MY PROFILE .makeup",0,0

"This is a very common plant. I heard it a lot when I was at school. I dont like it. The word slut is a way of shaming women for being sexual beings, when there is nothing wrong with being sexual, in fact there is nothing more natural. And it is terribly gendered. I never hear men being called sluts. Probably because theyre expected to be sexual beings. Even the term one night stand is steeped in judgement and negativity for me. I remember when I was younger, I assumed that any woman who had a one night stand would feel a bit lonely and worthless afterwards. Im not sure where this came from - probably popular culture that depicted these women as secretly desperate for love, and regretting having given away sex to a man who didnt want a relationship. It was a long time before it occurred to me that a woman might desire sex WITHOUT feeling any need for a relationship, or love. I still very rarely hear anyone describing a one off sexual encounter in a joyous way, but Im sure it happens, so why dont we talk about it? Women - Id love to hear your stories of sex outside the context of a longer term relationship, positive or negative or somewhere in between... . . . . .",1,2

"Hello tribe! So it has been steaming hot here on IG people as people are expressing their displeasure about certain people. . One thing that really bothers me about how we express displeasure about people (women especially) is how we quickly switch it up to body-shaming and slut-shaming. People just start with the ""see her fallen breasts"", ""fat legs"", ""shapeless"", ""she sleeps around for money"" and recently, ""she has body odor"". Now there is a whole song dedicated to one person about something as sensitive as alleged ""body odor"". Why do we feel the need to be rude or hurtful with our approach to criticizing ourselves and others? Does it make them better or do we just do it to make ourselves feel better? . Sometimes, I try to imagine if I was walking down the street and 5,000 or 10,000 people shouted such things to me. You should too before you go ahead to add to the numbers. The world is stressful enough for us to keep spreading such insensitivity/negativity with reckless abandon, lest we become even worse than the very people we criticize. . So as you continue today, I hope you caution yourself when you want to say something about someone's body or your assumptions about their lifestyle. Be kind, Be compassionate. . Yours in deep reflections... Love, Dr M",0,0

"You guys must remember this scene from , one of the most popular shows. This is where it all started for . The . The rumours that she was 'easy'. Something similar happened to me. I joined a coeducational school for my plus two. I was sixteen, right about the same age as Hannah. Anxious, excited, hopeful, ambitious, a little vain - that was me. I thought I was a likeable person. That no one can ever have any problem with me. I was friendly with the entire class! Then a boy, let's call him D, began to be a little too friendly. Like he would stop me in the corridor and start chatting. Call me at home for some inane reason. Rumours begin to fly that he liked me and wanted to ask me out. So what did I do? I confronted him. Told him that he was a good friend only and I wasn't interested in anything more. He denied having any feelings for me. And I didn't think much about it thereafter. Went back to being friends with him, cos I took him at face value. Turns out, I was being called a 'cockteaser'. First time I heard the word I didn't know what it meant. I was that naive. Then I was called 'frigid'. 'Ice queen'. 'Arrogant'. 'Thinks too highly of herself'. Within six months of joining my new school, I was labelled and categorised. Let's call this other guy A. His interest in me became apparent in class XII. I sensed danger, so I did a stupid thing. I tried to tie him a rakhi. He took it very badly. Few days later, a girl, D, asked me if what she heard was true. That I had gone to the school terrace with A and let him do 'stuff' with me. That day I cried in the school bathroom. I could see how some of the boys were looking at me. With knowing conspiratorial smiles on their faces. Whispering among themselves. Exactly what Hannah faces in the show. I have never ever talked about these incidents with anyone. And finally I have enough courage to talk about them on Instagram, for everyone to read. Cos I want you to speak u too.

NOT ASKING FOR IT . My thoughts about this topic have been wild the last days. Recently Ive been told that I gave the permission for being touched by a stranger because i have been too friendly and too nice. Like wow. We are in 2019 and still have to discuss things like this?? Women of all ages have a right to feel happy in their own skin and show it the way they want. If I want to be nice and friendly IM GOING TO BE. If i want to have sex with several humans guess what IM GOING TO HAVE IT. If I want to dress sexy and wear something short I WILL DO IT. All these things do not correlate to how sexually available I am. Doesnt it make more sense to teach men to keep their eyes and words and hands to themselves rather than to tell women to change their behaviour?

".and.ancestors  In February 1970, Kathleen Cleaver, communication secretary of the Black Panther Party (BPP), was asked by a reporter from the womens page of the Washington Post what she thought was a womans role in the revolution. She responded, in No one ever asks what a mans place in the Revolution is.1 To many, the BPP conjures up a hypermasculine image of Black men in leather coats and berets carrying shotguns. Yet at its heightaccording to a survey conducted by Chairman Bobby Seale in 1969the party membership was over 60 percent female.2 These women were integral to every aspect of party life, including serving as prominent leaders. Yet until recently, much of their work has been sidelined in historical research and popular media. Recent scholarship is shedding light on the role of women in the BPP and the Black struggle more broadly. For activists involved in todays strugglesfrom women who have been at the forefront of the Black Lives Matter movement, to the widespread impact and identification with (which among other things has prompted a reckoning with sexism within activist spaces), to the popular use of the term intersectionality to make sense of the interlocking forces of racial, class, and gendered oppressionthe experience of women in the BPP offers a host of lessons. The BPP emerged in an era of global mass revolt. In the United States, the struggle against anti-Black racism was the central flashpoint that opened up a mass radicalization around a whole host of issuesfrom war and imperialism, to womens and LGBT oppression, to class inequality and capitalism. By the end of the 1960s, millions of young Americans believed a revolution was necessary in this country and thousands flooded into revolutionary groups like the BPP. The BPPs Ten Point Program outlined a vision for liberation, encompassing demands for jobs, housing, education, and self-determination. In its early phase, the partys activity focused on point the fight against police brutality. Making use of their Constitutional rights, the Panthers boldly asserted their intention to use arms to defend the Black community from police viole",1,2
"SLUT How would you define the word? This four letter word needs a little unpacking. After yesterdays post I went to my studio and dug into my collection of dictionaries (yes I have a collection...) to uncover what Mr. Merriam & Webster had to say about it. Slut according to them was defined firstly as a woman with a disheveled appearance, a slovenly woman. Secondly a slut could be defined as a an unchaste woman or a woman having loose morals. Since then I think it safe to say that the definitions and uses of the word slut have shifted depending on who is saying it and to whom theyre saying it to. slut cant be found anywhere on Instagram, but and are some of the top hashtags using that reference. After doing a little research, I found that some women are bringing the word back and wearing it as a badge of honor, gay men are often called sluts but straight men are rarely ever defined by such a term. The several dictionaries never referred to a male counterpart inside of their definitions, and I found the words chaste/chastity and moral to have religious implications. Where does that leave us? Maybe you can help me add to this conversation? Can you use this word in a sentence? Have you ever been called a slut? How did it make you feel? Join me as I unfold this or just watch this little video I made, hit the button and keep scrolling, thanks for reading",1,2

"Slut shaming can happen to anyone, whether they enjoy sex frequently or have never had a kiss before. Shame is often aimed at women who enjoy an active sex life, as our culture teaches us that having too many partners or enjoying sex too much or too often or in certain ways is somehow wrong. When sex is considered shameful, it can be weaponized to hurt and control. . Lack of sex education goes hand in hand with slut shaming. It fosters a hostile attitude toward open, honest discussions of sex in real life, & creates more fear & stigma around sexuality. Women may fear being labeled slutty if they talk or are curious about sex. . In many abstinence only sex ed programs, young women are taught that having sex makes you used up, damaged, or unwanted by partners in the future. This can have serious long-term emotional effects long into adulthood. It takes a lot of work to re-write these negative, shaming scripts. . This shame not only makes sex-positive information less accessible but makes us feel alone in our experiences. Whether its celebrating a great sex life, or finding comfort & support around trauma - shame isolates us by silencing our voices & sending the message that something is wrong. . It also puts unhealthy pressure on those who are just beginning to learn about sex. When even exploring self-pleasure can be considered scandalous, then what about learning about consent & partnered pleasure? Young adults are quickly met with a barrage of social opinions & cultural fears around sexual activity & curiosity, & are taught not to enjoy or indulge in sex too much . Open, honest conversations about sex - whether in the classroom, our friend groups, or online - can help reduce these harmful shaming narratives & their effects in the world. The more we can bring our voices forward with information, inspiration, empowerment, comfort, solidarity, & support - the more we can share the truths of our sexual experiences. Together, our voices can help dispel myths & stigma around sexuality & create a more sex-positive future.",1,2

"In my sales job I have done very well in closing deals. A debate has come up whether I will still be able to close deals based on my appearance. As I will be appearing more and more masculine, should there be a fear that I would close less deals? Or is it based on other attributes, that are not physical? . Besides that, and for the most part, I have presented in my career as very androgynous. People confuse me as a man already, at times. It has not hindered me in my sales thus far. . The even idea of how I present and how it may effect my work, in my belief, is archaic, sexist, and shallow. The fact that this notion is even proposed is extremely hurtful to who I am as a person, and tarnishes the value I perceive others may place on my work as now, seemingly, it is not based on merrit but on appearance. .

"p a n i c d i s o r d e r . Warning - this is quite a long post, and mentions sexual assault. . . We went pumpkin picking this morning at Kenyon Hall Farm, which is something we do every year. I will be using mine now to make pumpkin spice cupcakes over the next week or so, which are amazing (if I do say so myself ) . Anyway, whilst we were there, I bumped into someone who caused me some trauma in my past... Long story short, about 7 years ago I was working in a pub in Warrington. I was quite good friends with the assistant manager there for a while, until he started to get a bit too friendly. It started with him being playful, and kind of flirty. That then progressed into him basically assaulting me every time we worked together on shift (which was about 4-5 times a week). Eventually I reported it to the BDM, and was told that it was just banter, and that they were very disappointed in me for wanting to take this further. I had to have a grievance meeting with four middle-aged men. . He was promoted to a general manager, and given his own pub. This was their solution to him sexually assaulting members of staff. . He now lives in the same town as me, and this is not the first time I've ran into him; the last time I had a bad panic attack in my car after seeing him. Today time was the first time he actually saw me. He looked quite shocked, but he more than likely won't dwell on it. I, however, went into panic-mode, my heart was pounding out of my chest, and I felt sick! Tom was there this time, which helped me stay calm, but it's hit me with a horrible low mood, which I'll probably have for the rest of the day. . It was this point in my life that I was diagnosed with a panic disorder, which is why I react the way I do when I see him. I never even feel like this is something I can talk about, because I was made to feel in the wrong. I wasn't even going to post it because I was worried it would seem attention-seeking, but I hate that I have to keep quiet about this stuff, whilst this guy goes about his life, probably not giving a F. .

In a fast-paced world where opportunities appear- and shift- at a moments notice, how you communicate can, quite simply, make or break your career. Your work environment today includes a diverse array of people and personalities. The ability to interact with all of them, think on your feet, and grab a good opportunity when its facing you is the special sauce that will help you achieve your goals. Dion Lim has seen it all. As an Asian-American woman in the hyper-competitive, white- and male-dominated business of TV news, her career path required a powerful blend of street smarts, determination, and a willingness to learn from mistakes  all of which she learned on the job. Today, shes an ABC anchor in one of the biggest cities in the country. In Make Your Moment, Dion guides you through what she has learned on the career battlefield and what it means for other working women today. Shell take you through the treacherousand often entertaininglandscape of the modern workplace, covering virtually every situation youre likely to experience. From the art of thinking quickly on your feet to moments, youll learn how to master office politics, make online/social media dynamics (good and bad) work for you, and thrive under pressure.

"Photo by Isadora Kosofsky Did you see this billboard on Robertson in Culver City in February and March? With writer and investigative journalist Kathy Dobie, we had the privilege of shadowing Stephanie Montgomery, the woman behind this powerful and gut-wrenching public installation. Artist, illustrator and muralist, Stephanie conceived of this billboard after she was raped at a club where she worked as a dancer. When the club and LAPD, with the DA most recently deciding not to prosecute, failed to take action, Stephanie decided to seek her own manifestation of justice. For 6 days, we watched as Stephanie, with a group of allies and fellow artists, paint this 42 by 14 ft tableau in a downtown LA warehouse. On a sunny February morning, with a group of Stephanies friends, we watched the billboard go up, observing as each inch was revealed.  While Im calling for justice. I dont expect it to happen. She said. I want this to be my justice It had to be, because it was all she ever got. And she got it herself, writes Kathy Dobie. Please take time today to read Stephanies story which was in print yesterday or see it online website. (More photographs to follow) 1. The billboard 2.

"But we dont need feminism anymore! they say, as UK deaths by domestic violence reach an all-time high, while over 49 million girls miss out on an education in Sub-Saharan Africa, and Saudi Arabian women cannot openly compete in sport, nor wear certain clothes. The idea that women are subordinate to men has been ingrained into society from the very start, and Im beginning to understand why more and more. Im currently reading Simone de Beauvoirs The Second Sex, and, while I have a lot to criticise about her as a person, as well as her writing, its becoming increasingly obvious that womans ability to give birth somehow made them inferior. That was largely because they could not fight nor hunt, as pregnancy effectively rendered them useless, and, once the child was born, the mother had to care for it, while the father fought, defended, or scavenged for food. What these primitives failed to realise was that the strength childbirth requires is absolutely immense, and the concept that women were merely weak, offspring-producing machines with little else about them was one that remained for centuries. - Liz . . .",0,0

"You think sexism is getting better... And then you see powerhouses DISNEY and Wal-Mart selling sexism to our youth in a pretty little box mixed in with the stereotypical ""girly"" toys. I looked for a similar box with a boy (or even a girl and boy) washing dishes on the front with no such luck. These are the messages that tell society that housework is feminine. AND YES, I HAVE HAD THIS TOLD TO ME BY A MAN AS WELL. My entire life I have loved things deemed ""masculine"". Fixing things, power tools, getting dirty exploring creeks and climbing trees. I can't believe it's 2019 and this crap is still being sold. It honestly wouldn't bother me if the package was ""unisex"". Disney and Wal-Mart are both leaders in their markets- please send better messages to our boys and girls. And don't you dare say it's because boys aren't interested... Because I'm not interested in doing your dishes either.",0,0

"Theres a sense of public entitlement to womens bodies, even if those bodies belong to children. Older people around me would try to protect me by advising me to cover up as much as possible, or would tease me about my developing body saying that some people just wouldnt be able to help it, especially as I got older. However their advice was meant, it excused the harassment I was beginning to endure from adult men, treating it like it was an inevitability and even placed some of the blame on me for what I was experiencing. Wondering why it had to be this way, how I could possibly be considered at fault for not preventing the actions of somebody else, I discovered feminism. I was eleven.

"I started because there is so much that is available to men that is just not available to women at all. A lot of female sexuality is demonized and repressed and I felt that was unfair. And I myself being bisexual, I would like to be in an environment where I can find both. I want to know if I make out with a guy, it's not going to make everyone uncomfortable. All the guys are not going to lose their boners. So part of it was a little bit selfish. - At the same time, I was in fashion and beauty, working with Louis Vuitton, Burberry, and all these brands. I felt like I was wasting my life to convince women to buy things they didn't need to make them feel happy for a temporary period. I decided Id rather spend my life helping people find true happiness through fulfilling sex lives. - And weed became part of NSFW because I think sex and cannabis are two of the greatest gifts that God has given us. They both have been demonized by people - religious leaders mostly - as a way to control people and use that as a way to shame people. And that way, they can get more money. That is the reason why religions are billion dollar industries. - I grew up as a Jehovahs Witness. I consider myself a true Christian. What Jesus taught was focused on your love of others as you love yourself, but so many people hate themselves because they have been shamed and feel like everything they're doing is wrong. They feel like every thought they have is an inclination towards evil and they're constantly stressed about very normal thinking. - I wanted NSFW to be a place people are proud to say they go. Five years ago, no one would've posted to their Instagram, I'm getting ready to go to the sex club. Now people do. Women especially love that they can walk around naked and no one is going to do anything to them. It is a safe, judgment-free space and people want to share that. We have a lot of members who bring people. One person said, I brought my cousin. I hope that's okay. And Im like, I dont know your family dynamic but sure. I even had one person tell me they wanted to bring their mom because she would love it and I was like, okay maybe not.",0,0

"Society makes me sick. Busty women are on both sides of my family. My youngest here is ALMOST 18. She rarely ever wears anything that shows her bust unless by accident or in . She's been told she reminds people of (pictured) . Swipe I see it some too but with a dash of latina from her Dad's side. The other thing they have in common? The baggy t-shirts, the basketball shorts. Billie too is 17 with large breasts but she has Papparrazzi and all her fans to contend with. It's so hot and Billie was caught out pretty recently in a tank top. What a disaster! Poor kid. My daughter often wears things too hot as have I to avoid unwanted attention from our busts. We shouldn't have to. Smh My daughter had to put this dog sticker on her breasts and turn off comments because she was being slut shamed and as always sexually harassed. You men have no idea what we as women (young Woman especially) go thru. It's bullshit. Btw the last pic is her Dad. He's over 200 lbs. He used to be a bouncer. He's mellowed out but not when it comes to perverts and the Women in his life ! Especially you older one's bothering my daughter ! And slut shaming please... My baby is far from a slut.
